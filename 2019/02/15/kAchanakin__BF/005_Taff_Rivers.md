Valerio,

  

The first image is clear, and can be enlarged to be more readable.

  

The scripts are available from<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriya_script#History>

Then its only a matter of doing some homework!

  

Oriya (Odia) is a language in its own right and as such it isn't Sanskrit.

  

The question to be asked is, is the parchment itself, a translation of a Devanagari scripted text?

If so, from which version?

  

 Hope this helps,  
  
Taff Rivers
