Dear teachers,

  

As I am proceeding (albeit slowly) with my Samskrita studies, I am also finding joy (and art) in the Devanagari script itself. To this end, it will be really helpful if you can guide me towards instructional books or resources that talk and teach calligraphy as it applies to Devanagari/Samskrita. Any pointers and help most appreciated.

  

PS: I apologize for my inability to make this request in Samskrita. I have not reached there yet. Someday.

  

SW
