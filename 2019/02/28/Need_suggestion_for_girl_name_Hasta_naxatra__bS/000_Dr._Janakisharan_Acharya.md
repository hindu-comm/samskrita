Namaste!  
  
I am searching my baby’s name from Hasta Nakṣatra (4^(th) Pāda) and the letter is “ठ”. I feel very difficulty in finding any suitable name from this Letter “ठ”. I have gone through MW dictionary and some other websites which provide suggestions, but I haven’t got any suitable name.



So my request to you to suggest a Sanskrit name for girl name. These are the criteria –

(1) It should be Sanskrit Name.

(2) It should from the Hastha Nakshatra (Pu, Sha, Na, Tha - पू, ष, ण, ठ).

(3) Must be 2-3 syllables.



Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
