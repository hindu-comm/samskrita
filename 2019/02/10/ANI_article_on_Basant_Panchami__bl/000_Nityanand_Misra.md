Dear list members

  

The news agency Asian News International (ANI) contacted me on Friday for an article on Basant Panchami. Their article published yesterday quotes me heavily. I talk about allusions to Vasantotsava in Vedic texts, spring in Sanskrit literature (including translations of a verse by Kalidasa and a sentence by Banabhatta), the more prevalent worship of Lakshmi on Vasanta Panchami in old days (when it was commonly called Shri Panchami) and the practice of Sarasvati worship and not studying being practices of *Gaudadesha*, and the relevance of the day for the Kumbha Mela.

  

Here is the link to the ANI article.

I would like to know if apart from the *[Varshakriyakaumudi](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.284107/page/n513)*, any other Sanskrit works refer to the worship of Sarasvati and the practice of not studying (अनध्याय) on the day of Vasanta Panchami. As per the *Varshakriyakaumudi* (16th cent CE), both these practices were in vogue in Bengal \[only\].

  

Thanks, Nityananda
