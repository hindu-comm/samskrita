दुःख लोभमूलानि पापानि व्याधयो रसमूलकाः ।  
स्नेहमूलानि दुःखानि त्रीणि त्यक्त्वा सुखी भवेत् ॥  
- अभिनवपाठावलि  
lobha mulAni pApAni vyAdhayaH rasamUlakAH ।  
sneha mUlAni duHkhAni trINi tyaktvA sukhI bhavet ॥  
- abhinavapAThAvali  
Greed is the cause of all sins, indulgence the cause of illness, attachment/friendship is the cause of sadness. If one lets go of the three, then he shall be happy.

  

Is the above translation correct?

What is the meaning ofरसमूलकाः?  

How is it that with friendshipone gets dukha?

Normally it is said halve your worries & doule your happiness by sharing with friends...

  

thanks
