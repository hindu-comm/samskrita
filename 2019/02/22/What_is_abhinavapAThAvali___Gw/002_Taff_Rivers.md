KN.Ramesh,

  

About everything, poems and proper examination...  

  

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वं न चापि काव्यं नवमित्यवद्यम्।

सन्तः परीक्ष्यान्यतरद्भजन्ते मूढः परप्रत्ययनेयबुद्धिः॥

  

Everything is not good simply because it is old;

nor a poem should be condemned simply because it is new;

the wise resort to the one or the other after (proper) examination;

(only) a fool has his mind led by the judgement of another.

  

Taff Rivers.
