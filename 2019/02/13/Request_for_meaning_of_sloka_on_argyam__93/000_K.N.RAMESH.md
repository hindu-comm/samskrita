Above are the slokas from vaidyanatha deekshiteeyam on giving argya page no.320..

  

I need the meaning of these.

1st sloka speaks about how much the argya water is to be thrown upward ( cow's horn) as per sruti vakya आप ऊर्ध्वं विक्षिपन्ति (kyv aruna 2nd chapter,2nd anuvakam)

Whether this argyam water can fall in water( like if you are doing in nadhi) or it should fall in bhoomi in a clean place?

  

2nd sloka 4th paada tells mudra should not be done

  

3rd sloka says if you join thumb & index finger it becomes rakshasa mudra and it equals to the blood.

Is it because the argyam becomes vajraayudham and hence it becomes blood.. Or since it becomes blood we should not give argya with thumb & index joined together?

  

Kindly clarify
