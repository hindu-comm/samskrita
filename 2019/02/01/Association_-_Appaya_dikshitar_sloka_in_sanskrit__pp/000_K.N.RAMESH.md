Iॐ श्रीगुरुभ्यो नमः।  
I वन्दे संस्कृतमातरम् I

मारमणम् उमारमणं फणधरतल्पं फणाधराकल्पम्।  
मुरमथनं पुरमथनं वन्दे बाणारिम् असमबाणारिम्॥

This verse was sung by one of the greatest saints,  
Shri Appayya Dikshita. He sang this on His visit to Chidambaram with his relatives, when He had darshan of both Lord Nataraja and Lord Govindaraja.

I bow to the consort of Mā (Lakshmi), the consort of Umā;  
the one with a snake-bed and the one with snake ornaments;  
the one who defeated Mura and  
the one who defeated Pura (Tripura),  
the enemy of Bāṇāsura (Lord Krishna) and  
the enemy of the one with odd number of arrows  
(Manmatha, who has five arrows).
