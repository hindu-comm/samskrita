Namaste,

  

        One plausible explanation can be that both Mahabharata and many Puranas were authored (or attributed to) by Vyasa. However, a number of recensions/versions

appeared with interpolations in the orally transmitted texts, translations in various languages occurred, manuscripts did not match and editing critical editions became

almost impossible. Thus any references will need to be considered in the context of what sources (in specific detail) were used for them.
