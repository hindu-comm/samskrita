Dear Mr. Sitarama,  
  

Namaste!  
  

Hope, you and your family-members are doing well!  
  

Following the 'Link' provided by you, I have gone through the Sanskrit Lesson-1 (Youtube Medium) of Shri Acharya Chandradutt Sharma and found the same very good in simple Hindi and lucid in its style!  
  

Could you send me the respective Links related to his other works also, since I felt it difficult to search for the same in [archive.org](http://archive.org)?  

  

As you are aware, since I teach the Sanskrit language online via. e-mail, I would like to be in touch with Shri Acharya Chandradutt Sharma. As such, I shall be highly thankful to you if you could convey his Full Postal Address, Contact Number(s) and E-Mail ID as a reply to this e-mail.  
  

Further, some time back, you had sent me 'Converters' for Devanaagarii and Telugu. Do you have any idea about any 'Converters' for Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam languages too? Please guide me in this direction, since Sanskrit-learning aspirants of the said languages are frequently asking for my Sanskrit Course in the Medium of their respective mother-tongue.  
  

Hope to hear from you soon.  
  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
