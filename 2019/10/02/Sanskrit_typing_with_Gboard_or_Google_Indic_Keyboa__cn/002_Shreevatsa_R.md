Just tried it with Gboard with the "Sanskrit" keyboard layout.

  

For "क्" -- first choose क (in the top-left). In the bottom-left, you'll see the halfक्  

  

For typing "बुद्धि" -- first choose ब then chooseबु then chooseद then chooseद् (in the bottom-left, as withक् above), then chooseध, then chooseद्धि

(It does not seem very convenient, but maybe one can get used to it.)

  
The other alternativeis the "abc ->संस्कृतम्" keyboard layout, where one can type (using a QWERTY keyboard) "buddhi" and hope to get the correct output बुद्धि (usually works for common words).
