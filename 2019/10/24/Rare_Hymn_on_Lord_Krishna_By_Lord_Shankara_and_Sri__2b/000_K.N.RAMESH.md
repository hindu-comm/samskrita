Dear All,

  

Greetings. **At the outset, may I wish you all a very happy Deepavali, which is just one week away. May The Festival of Light Illuminate every dimension of your lives with divine effulgence and grace**.

  

In this context, I am delighted to share a very rare hymn on **Lord Krishna** by **Lord Shankara** when **Lord Krishna** visits **Mount Kailash**. This is taken from **Harivamsha Puranam** (last Canto of **Mahabharata**), **Bhavishya Parva** and **Chapter 90**. In the brief **Phalashruti** **Lord Shankara** mentions that one gets absolved of all sins and granted of all rightful wishes by reciting this hymn devotedly every day.

  

**Lord Krishna's** visit to **Mount Kailsh** is explained in a few chapters and there is yet another **stuti** by **Lord Shankara** on **Lord Krishna** in **Chapter 88** which is preceded by **Lord Krishna's stuti on Lord Shankara**. **Lord Shankara**, in his stuti in **Chapter 88**, establishes beyond doubt that **there is no difference between Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.**

  

**ka iti brahmaNo nAma Isho.ahaM sarva-dehinAm \| AvAM tavA\~Nga saMbhUtau tasmAt keshava nAmavAn \|\| 48 \|\|**

**ahaM tvaM sarvago deva tvaM evAhaM janardana \| Avayor antaraM nAsti shabdair-arthajair jagatpate \|\| 61 \|\|**

**nAmani tava govinda yAni loke mahAnti ca \| tAn yeva mama nAmAni nAtra kArya vicAraNA \|\| 62 \|\|**

**tvad upAsA jagannAtha saivAsti mama gopate \| yashca tvAM dveShTi devesha sa mAM dveShTi na saMshayaH \|\| 63 \|\|**

***Meaning : ka is the name of Lord Brahama and I am the Isha omni-present in all manifestations and we originated from your divine body and that is why you are called Keshava (ka + Isha + va). You are me and I am You and there is no difference between us. One who meditates you, he meditates me too. One who hates you, hates me as well and let there be no doub***t.

  

I have also included a very rare hymn at the end on **Goddess Rukmini** taken from **Skanda purana**, **Prabhasa Khana**, **Dwaraka Mahatmyam** and **Chapter 22** which explains the procedure to worship **Goddess Rukmini**. This is the only hymn I have come across on **Goddess Rukmini.**

  

Once again best wishes for a very happy and prosperous **Deepavali**!

  

With best regards and Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
