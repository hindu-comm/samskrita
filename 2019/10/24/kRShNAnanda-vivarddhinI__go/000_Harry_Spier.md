Dear list members,

  

In theādyā-kālikā-stotram which lists the hundred names of Kali, verse 3 is:

  

kṛpā-mayī kṛpādhārā kṛpāpārā kṛpāgamā \|

  

kṛśānuḥ kapilā kṛṣṇā kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī \|\| 3 \|\|

  

  

Can anyone suggest other meanings ofkṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī other than "who

  

increasesthe bliss of Krishna". I was under the impression that Kali was not usually

  

associatedwith Krishna.

  

Thanks,

  

Harry Spier
