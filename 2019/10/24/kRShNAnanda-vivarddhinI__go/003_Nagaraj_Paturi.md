Kaalee, Kaalikaa is considered to be just the feminine form of Vishnu. Like Vishnu, she too is black, krishNaa.

  

She is called VaishNavee, NaaraayaNee, NaaraayaNasahodaree etc.

  

She has forms such as Vaaraahee, Naarasimhee etc. , which are feminine forms of Vishnu's avatàaras.

  

All such connections between Vishnu and Kali are brought into Bhagavata puraaNa through the story of Yogamaayaa being the substitute of Krishna or vice versa.
