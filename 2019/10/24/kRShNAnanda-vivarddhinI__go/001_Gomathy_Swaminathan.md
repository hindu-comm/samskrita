Yes Kali is an aspect of Durga, same as Yogamaya whom Vasudeva brings back from Nanda’s place. Kali is considered having the same qualities as Krishna. Maybe here it means that she pleases him by protecting him. Also in Soundarya Lahari, there is a reference to Vishnu’s Mohini Rupam which He assumes because of the grace of Devi.
