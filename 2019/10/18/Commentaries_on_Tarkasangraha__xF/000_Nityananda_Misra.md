Dear list members

  

There are at least 90 known commentaries on the *Tarkasangraha* as per the appendix in the excellent English translation of the work by Mm V N Jha (ISBN 978-93-80864-03-7, CIFSS, 2010). Have all these been published? By any chance would anybody have a list of all published commentaries or commentaries available on archive on the work?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
