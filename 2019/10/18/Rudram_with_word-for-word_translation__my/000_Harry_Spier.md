Dear list members,

  

Can anyone point me to editions of the Rudram with a word for word translation, either on-line or printed editions. If someone has a pdf of this is even better.

  

What I'm looking for is something very literal rather than a religious commentary on the names.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
