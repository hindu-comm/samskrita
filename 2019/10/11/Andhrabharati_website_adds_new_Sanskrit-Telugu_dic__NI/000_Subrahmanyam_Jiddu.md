Just wanted to inform Sanskrit enthusiasts familiar with Telugu script that Andhrabharati dictionary website has added a new dictionary "Samskrutha Andhra Nighantuvu" authored by Sri Mudhiganti Gopal Reddy Garu. The best part of the dictionary is vyutpatti/derivation of sanskrit words along with their meanings. The website already has "Samskrita Andhra Nighantuvu" published by Vavilla in 1943.

Hope this helps.
