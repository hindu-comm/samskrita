Thank you Harsha ji. Got it.

I was pointed to this line from Apte's dictionary:(a) सादृश्य 'likeness' or 'resemblance', अब्राह्मणः one like a Brāhmaṇa (wearing the sacred thread &c.), but not a Brāhmaṇa; a Kṣatriya, or a Vaiśya; अनिक्षुः a reed appearing like इक्षु, but not a true इक्षु.

  
Though this samasa is used as "non" butसादृश्य is applicable in situation where one appears as something but not that. As in above example, when one is appearing as a "brahmana" but is "not a brahmana"..

  

Thanks

Nagesh
