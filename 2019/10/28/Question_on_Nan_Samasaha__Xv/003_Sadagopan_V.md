The basic meaning of नञ् let us say is equal to English "non" , like in
violence × non-violence; brahmin × non- brahmin; etc.

  

So नञ् basically has a negative connotation.

  

Having said that, the context will determine which of the six extra implications referred to by Prof. Bhatt will be the additional import of नञ् in a given situation.

  

Obviously, अब्राह्मणः cannot refer to a stone, bird or animal but some human being (similar to brahmin). (तद्भिन्न but तत्सदृश)
