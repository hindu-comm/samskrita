There are few typo errors in the verse. The correct reading is as follows found in Devimahatmya as the prayer to Sarasvati as is clear in the verse:

  

घण्टाशूलहलानि शङ्‌खमुसले चक्रं धनु: सायकं  
हस्ताब्जैर्दधतीं घनान्तविलसच्छीतांशुतुल्यप्रभाम्।  
गौरीदेहसमुद्‌भवां त्रिजगतामाधारभूतां महा-  
पूर्वामत्र सरस्वतीमनुभजे शुम्भादिदैत्यार्दिनीम्॥

Only bell and not any weapon.

No. It is plough used as weapon. Like that Balabhadra uses it and called हलायुध.

According to you bright sunbeam after the clouds end.

  

But it cannot be cool when clouds are cleard. Here and anywhere such description is not found. But it is the moon who is described as शीतांशु compared to fair complex of women cool and white in poetry and never the sun is compared. In the other verse it is equal to that of moon and here it is explicitely said as white. The reason to be white complex as she has born from the body of गौरी that is also white as stated inगौरीदेहसमुद्भवां.

  

  

Hope this helps. I have not translated the whole verse as you have already understood the purport.
