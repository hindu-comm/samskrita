Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. **Ashadha** month (**Adi** in Tamil) is dedicated for the worship of **Sri Ambal**. It is a practice to worship **Sri Devi** throughout the month but especially on Fridays and Tuesdays.

  

In this connection, I am delighted to share a very rare and sweet hymn on **Goddess Sati Dev**i by **Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva** collectively. As you might see in the prayer, they pray to the Goddess as the **Mula Prakriti** and the originator of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.

  

As we all know, Santana Dharma does not differentiate among **Goddess Parvati**, **Goddess Lakshmi** and **Goddess Saraswati** which, by deduction, means that there is no differentiation among Trinity as well.

  

May We Pray to **Loka Mata Sri. Devi** through this beautiful prayer.

  

With best regards and pranams,

  

K. Muralidharan Iyengar
