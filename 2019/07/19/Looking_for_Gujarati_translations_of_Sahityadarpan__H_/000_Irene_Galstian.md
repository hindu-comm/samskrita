I'm looking for the items above on behalf of a friend.  
Kavyadarsa translation does exist, but I couldn't find it as a PDF.  
But that's OK, since there is the option of scanning the physical  
book.  
But so far it seems like Sahityadarpana has never been translated into  
Gujarati. Could someone please confirm or refute this?  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
