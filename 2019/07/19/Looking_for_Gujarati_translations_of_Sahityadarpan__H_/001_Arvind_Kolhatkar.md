Irene,

  

My gut-opinion...

  

Gujarati (or other modern vernaclars) translation of Sahityadarpana is unlikely to have been made. The reason is simple. During the old times when these old Samskrit texts were studied in traditional pathashalas, the medium of instruction was Sanskrit and there was never felt any need to render them into Gujarati. Learning was always considered to be in Sanskrit and no value was attached to learning in vernaculars.

  

When these books became parts of carricula in universities like Bombay or Calcutta after 1860's, the medium of instruction was English and several scholars produced their own textbooks in English for the use of students. (For example, MM PV Kane prepared his text of Sahityadarpana in 1910 in English.) The vernaculars never reached a stage in which books of higher learning were produced in those languages, because there was no demand for them.

  

(Caveat - I do know of Hindi versions of SahityaDarpaNa and Kavyaprakasha by Dr Satyavrata Sinha, published in 1957 by Chaukhamba Vidya Bhavan.)
