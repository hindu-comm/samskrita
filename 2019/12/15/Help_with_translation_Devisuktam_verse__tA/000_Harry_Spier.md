Dear list members,

  

For verse 3 of the Devi Suktam I've seen two very different translations:

  

Verse 3 is:

kalyāṇyai praṇatāṁ vṛddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo namaḥ \|

nairṛtyai bhūbhṛtāṁ lakṣmyai śarvāṇyai te namo namaḥ \|\|

  

The two translations differ in how they interpretnairṛtyai.

  

The first translation which is from a translation in the Lalchand Sanskrit Library is:

  

We bow down to yourself who is auspicious. We bow down you all in the form of Riddhi (prosperity) & Success (Siddhi). Salutation is also due to her who is in consort of Lord Shiva & who herself is good (Laksmi) & bad (Alaksmi) fortune for kings.

  

  

The second translation (which interpretsnairṛtyaias tonairṛtī (a name of Durgā) is:

  

We bow to Kalyani for the success and prosperity of the devoted.
Salutations, salutations to Nairrti, who is the glory of sovereigns. Salutations, salutations to Sharvani the wife of Shiva.  

  

Which translation has the correct meaning fornairṛtyai .

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
