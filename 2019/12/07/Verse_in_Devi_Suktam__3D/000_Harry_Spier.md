Dear list members,

  

The third verse of the version of the Devi Suktam I have agrees with most versions on the internet and is:

  

kalyāṇyai praṇatāṁ vṛddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo namaḥ

nairṛtyai bhūbhṛtāṁ lakṣmyai śarvāṇyai te namo namaḥ

  

But I don't understand the grammar of this verse. Is the grammar correct?

Is kurmo the 1st person plural of the verbkṛ (to do)?

A manuscript I have of this hymn haskūrmyai instead of kurmo

  

Also are praṇatāṁ and bhūbhṛtāṁ feminine singular accusative and if so, then why is the accusative used?

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
