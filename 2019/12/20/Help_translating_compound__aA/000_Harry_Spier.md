Dear list members,

  

Verse 3 of thekanakadhārāstotram is:

  

āmīlitākṣamadhigamya mudā mukundaṁ

  

ānandakandamanimeṣamanaṅgatantram \|

  

ākekarasthitakanīnikapakṣmanetram

  

bhūtyai bhaven mama bhujaṅgaśayāṅganāyāḥ \|\| 3 \|\|

  

  

I'm having trouble translating the compoundākekarasthitakanīnikapakṣmanetram.

  

I've parsed it as:ākekara-sthita-kanīnika-pakṣma-netram

.

Does this mean something like:

  

1) The eye, eyelash and pupil are in the state of being slightly closed.

  

I.e. ākekara-sthita = state of being slightly closed,kanīnika = pupil,
pakṣma = eyelash,

  

But If its a dvandva then shouldn't it be in the plural?

  

  

or something like:

  

  

2) The slightly closed pupil of the eye becomes instantly steady.

  

i.e. ākekara = slightly closed,sthita-kanīnika = steady pupil, pakṣma = instantly

  

  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  

Thanks,

  

Harry Spier
