Interesting but the source of the Hindi-Indian word 'chai' from the original Chinese, as explained in the Wikipedia article '[Etymology of tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_tea)' sounds more convincing. Besides the English 'tea', it also explains why 'tea' is 'thé' in French or 'Чай' Russian, pronounced 'chay' . Molesworth's Marathi-English Dictionary, published in 1831, traces the Marathi word 'चहा' to its Persian origin. The fortuitous similaity of sound betweenकषाय and चाय is amusing but probably nothing more than that.

  

Tea drinking became a habit in India only from the early 19th century when the British brought the plant into India and created tea plantations, originally in Assam. (One of the gifts the Peshwas in Pune used to appreciate from the British resident attached to the Maratha court was tea leaves!) As recently as in the early 1950's tea drinking was frowned upon in orthodox families and the Swadeshi movement of the pre-independence days regularly targeted tea.
