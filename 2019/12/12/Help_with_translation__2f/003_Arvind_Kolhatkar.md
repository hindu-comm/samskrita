Sorry this is somewhat out of context of the above discussion.

  

The word 'शुम्भ' in the discussion above reminded me of a phrase in Marathi 'शुंभासारखे उभे राहणे' - standing motionless and speechless, without any reaction. I wonder what is the story behind this. Did
'शुम्भ' in the original mythology stood motionless? If someone knows the clarification I would like to have it.
