There is no script for Sanskrit. People were using scripts of regional languages like telugu, kannada, kaithi etc. A few hundred years ago, people started using Devanagari Script. Devanagari is not as old as Sanskrit. The language is not determined from the script alone. Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit and probably other languages like Nepali used Devanagari Script. It is the content and not the script that decides a language. Roman script is used by so many European languages.
