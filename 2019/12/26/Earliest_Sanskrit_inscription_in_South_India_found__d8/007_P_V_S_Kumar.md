Dear Ken,

  

Just like Roman (Latin) script is used for most of the languages in the Europe, Devnagari script is being used by many languages such as Sanskrit, Prākrit, Hindi, Marathi, Nepali.

  

Hindi languages always uses Devnagariscript only. Napali languageis written in other script also.Sanskrit language which has no specific script of its own, can be written in any script. In the West, Roman is the most used script for Sanskrit. Within India, script used for Sanskrit varies from region to region - Devnagari, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, etc. But, before all these modern scripts were developed,Sanskrit was written in Brahmi, Sarada (Kashmir region), Grandtha (in South India), etc. scripts. Even each of these scripts changedshapesover period of time. So, again we can find multiple versions within each of those scripts.

  

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmi_script>for more information on Brahmi script and its variations.

  

Regards

PVS Kumar
