Dear Dr Rao,  
  
I've seen announcements for your Sanskrit course a few times and would  
like to find out the end-level of the course graduates. For example,  
if you distribute readings or course materials, would it be possible  
to have a look at the last such document? This way I could explain to  
people who might be interested in signing up for the course, how much  
Sanskrit are they likely to know at the end of this course. This can  
be inspiring and would encourage people to join and to persevere.  
  
Thank you,  
Irene
