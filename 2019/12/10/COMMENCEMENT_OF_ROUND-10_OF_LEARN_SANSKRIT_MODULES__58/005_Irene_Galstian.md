Dear Dr Rao,  
  
Thank you for the table of contents. There are many courses in which  
these topics would be present. Indeed, can there be a Sanskrit course  
in which these would be absent?  
  
Still, different courses have different efficacies in terms of what  
the student is able to do after finishing the course and working  
through its materials diligently. There are some, who have done their  
homework assignments, but who still can't read and understand anything  
other than the so-called 'pedagogical' sentences in Sanskrit. There  
are other courses, which manage to effectively impart reading and  
understanding skills, as these are needed to read existing texts in  
Sanskrit. Still others teach speaking and writing facility, which  
allows the student to speak and to compose letters, with correct  
usage.  
  
When I asked about the content of the course, it is these aspects I  
was enquiring about.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
