Towards this end, IA has established several domain specific vertical networks as well as city based horizontal networks, for public intellectuals of similar interests to*connect*with one another. IA has also*co operated*with the efforts of several students, scholars, public intellectuals and institutions for a wide variety of causes through its grants program. IA has actively*collaborated*with several NGOs, Think Tanks, Universities, Gurukulas, Media platforms etc for research and organising events.

Indic Mentor Network, powered by MentorCloud

In order to encourage senior Indic scholars and thought leaders from all over the world to be mentors and to guide and transfer their knowledge and experience to students and upcoming public intellectuals, IA has approached Dr. Ravishankar Gundlapalli, Founder & CEO of MentorCloud, and Author of "The Art of Mentoring," for collaboration. Impressed by the work of IA and its larger mission, Dr. Ravi readily agreed to offer the MentorCloud technology platform on a pro bono basis and also offer his expertise in the design, launch and engagement of experts and seekers on the Indic Mentor Network.

"Being an Indian by birth, this is a great opportunity for me to give back to my motherland, and to contribute to the revival, perpetuation and dissemination of Indic Thought Leadership and Sanatana Dharma," added Dr. Ravi.

Sharing his excitement for this partnership, Hari Kiran Founder said "We are truly grateful to Dr Ravi for giving us this platform. Right from our inception creating and nurturing networks has been a key element of our strategy, especially domain specific vertical networks.
