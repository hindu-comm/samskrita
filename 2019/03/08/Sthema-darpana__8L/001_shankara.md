Jagannathaji,

  

As per New Catalogus Catalogorum vol 6, page 155 published in 1971, a manuscript of 'sthemadarpana' of Gopalacharya is preservered at GOML, Madras. Another source (Theistic Vedanta - R Balasubramanian, page 192), attributes this work to Viraraghava Sathakopayati, 37th pontiff of Ahobila Matha. Gopalacharya could be the purvasrama name of the 37th pontiff of Abhobila Matha.  

  

regards  
shankara

As per my knowledge goes, Pillaipakam Varadacharya had composed a small work namely STHEMA-DARPANA(justification of the word STHEMAN with examples). Any information about availability of this work is most welcome.
