I don't think they are mistakes.

.

  

The following are some that I bothered to correct the rest have been highlighted in the text.

  

using अस्ति in Sanskrit as one would use है or हैं in Hindi is one of the most common mistakes. But it should be understood that both are not analogous and अस्ति should be used only if the situation demands otherwise it becomes redundant and jarring.

There is nothing wrong in using अस्ति, though the sentence will be complete without अस्ति or भवति. Anyhow its not prohibited anywhere.  

  

  

एष should be एषः

  

  

अस्ति is not required

क should be कः  

रामो

These are not mistakes! But forms in Sandhi. कः+एषः+बालकः = क एष बालकः!



In short, follow the Sandhi rules everywhere uniformly or do not follow. But it should be consistent everywhere. All the highlighted portions are such mistakes and not any grammatical mistakes.
