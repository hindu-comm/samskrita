The entire context is -

अनागतं यः कुरुते स शोभते,

स शोच्यते यो न करोत्यनागतम् ।

वनेऽत्र संस्थस्य समागता जरा

बिलस्य वाणी न कदापि मे श्रुता ॥

While doing the अन्वय, one should correlate मे with वनेऽत्र संस्थस्य and not with श्रुता ।

वनेऽत्र संस्थस्य मे (= मम) जरा समागता, (परन्तु) बिलस्य वाणी कदापि न श्रुता ।

Majority of the words in Sanskrit have a fixed gender, and their gender does not change just because other accompanying words have a different gender.

शील, शौर्य, आलस्य, पाण्डित्य - are all to be used in neuter gender only. संग्रह is to be used in masculine gender only (and hence gets the visarga in प्रथमा एकवचन form).
