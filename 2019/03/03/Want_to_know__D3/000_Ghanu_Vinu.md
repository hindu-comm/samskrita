Namaste respected members,

"Bilasya Vani na me shruta" in this title of the story of Panchatantra, may I know why me is used? As far as I know "me" form doesn't come in tritiya vibhakti then which case is used in "me" and why.

Please favour me.

Another query

Shilam souryam analasyam pandityam mitrasangrah:

Anchor aharaniyani panchetani Akshat nidhi

In above shlok why in mitrasangrah visarg is given,whereas in other words neuter gender forms are applied.

Please give me reply.

Shrighanu
