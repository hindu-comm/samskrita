Namaste,

  

There is a small collection of subhashitas on parents in Subhashita Padya Ratnakara Part 2, from page 970 (section 37). These subhashitas are mostly from smritis, puranas, etc. This volume is available online at [jainelibrary.org](http://jainelibrary.org)  

  

<https://jainelibrary.org/book-detail/?srno=023175>

  

regards  
shankara
