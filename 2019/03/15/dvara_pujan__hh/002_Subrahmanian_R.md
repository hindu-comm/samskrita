We have in Tamil Nadu a 'kaaraDaiyaan nonbu' performed by Ladies on the Day of Meena Sankaranti and at the precise time of Meena Sankaranti. It is traditionally associated with Satyavan Savitri and the vrat and offering to God will ensure longevity of the husband's life and the woman's auspiciousness.
