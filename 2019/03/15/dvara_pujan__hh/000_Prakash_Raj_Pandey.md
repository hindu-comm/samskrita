Pranam to all learned scholars

  

We have the tradition of dvara pujan on the day of Meena Sankranti, and it is performed by a daughter without reciting any mantra. My aunt (my father's sister) used do perform the puja till she was able to do so. Now, my daughter performs the puja.

  

I think it is somehow related with dvaramatrika pujan, however, do not have the text prescribing this puja.

  

I feel the group members can come provide me the answer.
