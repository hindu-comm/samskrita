There's no rule for making here the sandhi used here. As Abhyankar has suggested the rules applicable, the form cannot be as given in the text. It can be सख इतिbut it has further joined out of rules of Panini. Hence it called as आर्ष archaic usage generally by the commentators. Here also it is the same usage. Prasad has suggested epic usage in Ramayana and Mahabharata. The purpose is the same. If sandhi rules is followed, it will change the metre having सख इतिfour letters instead of three required. That's the reason for not doing the regular sandhi.
