Your question is perfect. the last word should be taken as सखे+इति

But, your suggestion of सखे+इति = सखैतिis not correct  

I am just deliberating =>

सम्बुद्धौ एकवचनम् for सखि (पुं.) is हे सखे

So, last word should be taken as सखे+इति. संधि of this will either be सखयिति (by एचोऽयवायावः पा. 6'1'78) or सख इति (by लोपः शाकल्यस्य पा.8'3'19)

Theoretically therecannot be further संधि of सख इति as सखेति 

So, it should be सखयिति or सख इति
