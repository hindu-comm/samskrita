नमस्ते वर्जिनी-वर्य !

The meter here is of 11 letters in each quarter.

In the second line one letter becomes extra, whether the संधि be done as सखे+इति = सखयति or सखे+इति = सख इति. In both cases the extra letter would be य or इ. Both these letters are of 1 मात्रा.

Actually for अक्षरगणवृत्त-s one should be worried of any extra letter than an extra मात्रा, though in this case the extra letter would bring in an extra मात्रा.
