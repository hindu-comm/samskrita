Dear all

I am an experienced Sanskrit teacher, who is teaching Sanskrit for 4 years now, and I would like to teach Sanskrit for free of cost online through video calls to any native English speaker in return to learn English language with accent.

My special expertise is in complete practical Grammar without studying Sutras. I have graduation in Navya Nyaya and Alankara Shastra.

  

Regards

KP
