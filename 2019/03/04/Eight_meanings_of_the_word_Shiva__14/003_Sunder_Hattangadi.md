"Shunya Siddhanta

The concept of Shunya in Veerashaivism is of great philosophical significance. Shunya is nothing yet everything; neither tangible nor intangible yet both and beyond. It is the distinction-less absolute, transcending perishable and imperishable states. Allama Prabhu’s aphorism: ‘Emptiness is sown in Emptiness; Emptiness is reaped out of emptiness; Emptiness is merged in Emptiness and turned into empty. Emptiness is life, Emptiness is perception’, may well be juxtaposed with the peace invocation of the Vedas: ‘The invisible is the whole, the visible too is the whole. From the whole, the visible universe of infinite expansion has come out. The whole remains the same, even though the infinite universe has come out of it.’
