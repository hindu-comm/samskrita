For your information.

  

 The following post of yours has some unusual ASCII characters that look like the escape meta character - shown emboldened.

  

The problem is that my offline Windows desktop application -**Mailbird** - hangs when trying to download it.

  

  

दानेन तुल्यो विधिरास्ति नान्यो लोभोच नान्योस्ति रिपुः पृथिव्या ।

विभूषणं शीलसमं च नान्यत् सन्तोषतुल्यं धनमस्ति नान्यत् ॥

  

There is no ritual (vidhi) that is more noble than giving (dana); there is no worse enemy than greed.

There is no better ornament than good character; there is no better wealth than contentment (santosha).122.
