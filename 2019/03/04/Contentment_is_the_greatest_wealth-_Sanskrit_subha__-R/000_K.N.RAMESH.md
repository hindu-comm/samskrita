दानेन तुल्यो विधिरास्ति नान्यो लोभोच नान्योस्ति रिपुः पृथिव्या ।  
विभूषणं शीलसमं च नान्यत् सन्तोषतुल्यं धनमस्ति नान्यत् ॥

There is no better ornament than good character; there is no better wealth than contentment (santosha).122. saMraohit AgnaInaa dgQaM vanaM prSaunaa htma\\ a vaacaa du$>M baIBa%saM na saMraohit vaak\\xatma\\ aa

mahaBaart.13.161.34 Bhishma counsels Yudhisthira that the forest destroyed by fire or depleted by stripping will grow again in time; but the mind wounded by harsh words or insults will never be healed (Mahabharata 13:161.34).
