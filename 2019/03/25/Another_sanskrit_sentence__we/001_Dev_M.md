Hello Harry,

  

It should be born in mind that no word is an exact synonym of another word in any language. It is much more relevant in the case of Asian languages which are high context languages. Though a multitude of words seem to convey similar meanings but there are subtle differences. So is the case with sentence construction. Given a context only one form of sentence is appropriate and accordingly meaning changes. This is extremely true in Asian languages as they leave a lot unsaid even in written texts and as a norm one should read between the lines. This is the reason why most of the English translations use circuitous, archaic language as a norm.



The following are answers to your queries.

1)

प्रयत्न here should be interpreted as perseverance and not force

महता प्रयत्नेन conveys the idea "lots of perseverance"

महाप्रयत्नेन conveys "great perseverance".

  

Though there does not seem to be any difference at the first glance but both are different. To bore a hole in a wall you need lots of perseverance and not great perseverance. The thief could be awarded for that if it was a contest of perseverance for he has lots of it.

  

2)

कृतेन conveys that the fact that the thief had expended energy in the form of perseverance, a hint of strife.

महता प्रयत्नेन कृतेन विवरेण should be translated as "striven through lots of perseverance"

  

अयम् चौरो महता प्रयत्नेन कृतेन विवरेण गृहं should be translated as "this thief having meticulously striven to bore a hole into the house through lots of perseverance"

  

3)

अपहृत्य may loosely be translated as stealing but conveys an inherent resistance by the owner.

आहृत्य may loosely be translated as taking It does not convey an inherent resistance by the owner.

  

hence it may safely be assumed that the thief took the articles without the cognizance of the owner, for the owner did not resist.

  

4)

विविधानि हिरण्मयानि आभरणानि means "different types of gold ornaments" perhaps a gold belt, gold necklace.

नानाप्रकाराणि हिरण्मयानि आभरणानि. means "all sorts of ornaments made of gold" for example a thin gold belt a wide gold belt, a long gold necklace a short gold necklace.

do you understand the difference between the above translations?

  

I do not understand what you mean by "Whats the best way to say this in a compound?"

  

5)

a\)

  

नानाप्रकाराणि हिरण्मयानि आभरणानि रजतमयानि च भाण्डानि दृष्ट्वा तानि आहृत्य may be translated as "different gold ornaments and different silver utensils were seen and they were taken"

दृष्टानि नानाप्रकाराणि हिरण्मयानि आभरणानि रजतमयानि च भाण्डानि आहृत्य
may be translated as " saw different gold ornaments and different silver utensils which were taken"

  

The first statement conveys an inherent effort by the thief, i.e. he looked around for gold ornaments and silver utensils and having seen them took the liberty of taking them.

The second statement does not convey an inherent effort by the thief, i.e. he found gold ornaments and silver utensils upon entering the house and having seen them took the liberty of taking them.

  

  

b)

यानि नानाप्रकाराणि हिरण्मयानि आभरणानि रजतमयानि च भाण्डानि अपश्यत् तानिआहृत्य

  

यानि is an inappropriate usage here as it is a spatial relative while you might want to use a temporal relative, though it would be unnecessary.

  

Thank you,

M. Kameshwari Prasad Dev
