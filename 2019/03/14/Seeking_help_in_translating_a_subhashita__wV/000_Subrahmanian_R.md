Respected scholars,

  

I am unable to understand the following sloka, a riddle, found in a text book.

अम्लानपङ्कजा माला

 कण्ठे रामस्य सीतया।

मुधा बुधा भ्रमन्त्यत्र

 प्रत्यक्षेपि क्रियापदे॥

  

The book give the answer as:

’प्रत्य्क्षेपि’ इत्येतत् क्रियापदम्

I think the first two padas mean: In the neck of Rama, unfaded Lotus Garland, by Sita - (an incomplete sentence)

  

I will be thankful for explaining the meaning and the answer.

  

Respectfully

R Subrahmanian
