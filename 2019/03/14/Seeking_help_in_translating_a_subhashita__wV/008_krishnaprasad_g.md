I am not well versed in English to give translation. But try.

Even though the verb appears (प्रत्यक्षेपि) wise people मुधा वृथा simply confuse.

प्रत्यक्षेपि should be taken into account twice and understood differently eachtime. 1st time "to put" later" even though appears"

You seem to be newbie to Sanskrit.

I suggest you to read from the scratch to enjoy these verses. Start with RG Bhandarkar And VS Apte books .

Allthe best
