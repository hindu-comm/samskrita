Thank you Krishnaprasad ji and Abhyankar ji.

However, I am not versatile enough to understand मुधा बुधा भ्रमन्त्यत्र also.

The first word, with Dictionary help I understand means uselessly, waste etc

What is बुधा and भ्रमन्ति + अत्र, भ्रमन्ति looks like a verb, to roam, to ambulate.

  

Do help me about that also,

Namaskaram
