First of all I need it in देवनागरी

I got it at \<<https://www.facebook.com/vedicupasanaa/posts/10150577536098843?__tn__=-R>\>

लोभश्चेदगुणेन किं पिशुनता यद्यस्ति किं पातकैः  
सत्यं चेत्तपसा च किं शुचि मनो यद्यस्ति तीर्थेन किम् ।  
सौजन्यं यदि किं निजैः स्वमहिमा यद्यस्ति किं मण्डनैः  
सद्विद्या यदि किं धनैरपयशो यद्यस्ति किं मृत्युना ॥

If greed is part of a man's character, why should he need other bad qualities; if there is wickedness, why want sins; if truthfulness why need religious austerities; if there is purity of why should he go one a pilgrimage? If he has goodness of heart why should he want relatives? If he has reputation, ornaments are superflous. If he possessess learning, what need he care for wealth; if he has a bad name why should he need death?

  

This translation does not get to the spirit of the verse.

  

There are eight pairs of words in the verse. The pairs are such that if one is present, presence of the other seems superfluous. The eight pairs and my translations accordingly would be =>

लोभः/अगुणम् = If there is greed, checking absence of merit is superfluous

-   Greed is itself such demerit, that checking presence of any other
    demerit is superfluous

पिशुनता / पातकानि = If there is cruelty, wickedness, checking sinfulness is superfluous

सत्यम् / तपः = If there is devotion unto truth, checking observance of austerities is superfluous

शुचि मनः / तीर्थाटनम् = If mind is pure, pilgrimage is superfluous

सौजन्यम्/ निजाः = If there is nobility, checking selfish interests is superfluous

स्वमहिमा / मण्डनानि = If there is eminence, ornamental decorations are superfluous

सद्विद्या / धनानि = If there is knowledge and intelligence, all other wealth are superfluous

अपयशः / मृत्युः = If there is (only) failure, worrying about death is superfluous.
