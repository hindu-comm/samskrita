ken p,

  

 Not only is this transliteration using strange characters.

But also the translation makes little sense.

  

Is it about vairāgyābhya by any chance?

  

YS. I. 12 Abhyāsa-vairāgyābhyām tan nirodhaḥ.

  

In which the YS, doesn't just talk about that mental state of abstraction,

but gives instruction on how to realise it.
