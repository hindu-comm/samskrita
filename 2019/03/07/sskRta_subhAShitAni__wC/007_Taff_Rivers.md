 Answer the questions please.

  

What is the source of the 'transliteration'?

 Aside from the misspellings it seems authentic, so I doubt that you composed it yourself.

  

Who is the 'translator'?

 The 'translation' is a very loose one. i.e. it only vaguely resembles the tightness of the original.

  

*Greed* is limited to material possessions, the appropriate English translation is *desire/yearning* which embraces mental things. The desire for a better transliteration scheme is an example of a desire. Only through renunciation of such desires does one become truly liberated!

  

  

A general lack of thought is apparent in this matter:

Should a northern Indian wish to correspond with a southern Indian, or vice versa, which 'scheme' should they use?

Given that both participants would be familiar with the standard one, and neither are likely to be familiar with the others customised one.

  

  

Be a light unto our darkness.
