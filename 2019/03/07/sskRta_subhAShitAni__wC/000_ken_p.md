*Lobhashchedaguṇena kï , pishunatā yadyasti kï prātakaiḥ*

*There is no need of any other bad qualities if you have greed. There is no bigger sin than slandering. There is no penance greater than leading a truthful life. If you have purity in mind, there is no need to do any pilgrimage. If one is courteous, he does not need kinsmen. If a person is confident of himself, then he would not want ornaments. If you have sound education, then there is no need of wealth. If a person is infamous, then he does not need death*
