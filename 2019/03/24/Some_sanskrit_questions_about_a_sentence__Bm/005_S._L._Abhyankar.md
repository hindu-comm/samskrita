If thieves would adopt means to be invisible both in the day and in the night, converse of this is to be vigilant, whether day or night as in या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी / यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः //गीता 2'69//

Smearing with charcoal powder or black attire may make one invisible in the night.

Making oneself invisible in the daytime seems difficult, rather impossible. There was a film "Mr. India", wherein a scientist had invented a wrist-band making "Mr. India" invisible, except that he could be seen through a red glass.

Uniforms of army men is designed to camouflage them in bushes.

Many creatures such as chameleons are endowed with that amazing Self-protection capability.

Would the text be more elegant as

न तत्र विचित्रं किञ्चिद्यत् कृष्णावरणैश्चोरो घनान्धकारे न दृश्यते /

विचित्रः कोऽपि लेपोऽयं येन लिप्तो दिवसापि न दृश्यते यथादृश्यास्तारकाः सर्वाः नभसि भास्करागमे //
