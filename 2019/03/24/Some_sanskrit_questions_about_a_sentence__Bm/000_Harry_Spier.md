Dear list members,

  

In a Sanskrit textbook there is this sentence for translation.

  

Therefore just as the stars of the sky are invisible in the light of day, in the same way thieves who have smeared their bodies with these powders unknown by others are able to make themselves invisible by day or night.

  

The translation given in an answer book to the textbook is: (the answer book has words separated for ease for beginners)

  

ततो यथा एव आकाशस्य तारका दिवसलोके अदृश्यास् तथा चौरा अन्यैर् अज्ञातश् चूर्नैः शरीराणि विलिप्य दिने रात्रौ वा आत्मानं अदृश्यं कर्तुं शक्नुवन्ति \|\|

  

My questions are:

1\) I'm not clear why the translation given was अन्यैर् अज्ञातश् चूर्नैः and notअन्यैर् अज्ञातैश् चूर्नैः

isn'tthis an adjective of चूर्नैः and so has to agree with it?

  

2) In this sentence is it equally correct to use a past participleविलिप्ताः in the sentenceinstead of the gerundविलिप्य

.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
