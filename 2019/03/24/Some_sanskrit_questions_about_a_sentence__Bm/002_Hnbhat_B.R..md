You are correct.

But I am not sure what is the use of powders unknown to others in making them invisible to others. The thieves may not be known to others in general and adjective to the चौराः and it can be be a typographic mistake forअज्ञाताश्!

But in the sentence, the structure is clumsy.

It should be चूर्णैः instead ofचूर्नैः.
