Thanks sunder ji..

Where from these slokas are quoted..? any idea..

  

AFIK there is only one devata for the entire mantra and that is savitaa..

Are the akshara devatas quoted are " Gayatri mantra specific" Or the akshara devatas are same irrespective of the mantra...?

Request members to help on these.
