Sandhi is a phonological phenomenon, i.e. it has to do with sound / how words are pronounced.

As a rule of thumb, splitting sandhi is optional in prose and mandatory in poetry.

  

These examples in the question are purely orthographical, i.e. they just have to do with spelling: the conventions we use for representing sounds.

  

Example of split sandhi:

सुरैः ब्रह्मर्षिभिः च एव श्रुत्वा यत् अभिपूजितम् = suraiḥ brahmarṣibhiḥ ca eva śrutvā yat abhipūjitam

(generally not allowed in verse)

  

Example of joined sandhi:  
सुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् =surairbrahmarṣibhiścaiva śrutvā yadabhipūjitam  

OR

सुरैर् ब्रह्मर्षिभिश् चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् = surair brahmarṣibhiś caiva śrutvā yadabhipūjitam  

OR

सुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैवश्रुत्वायदभिपूजितम् =surairbrahmarṣibhiścaivaśrutvāyadabhipūjitam  

OR

सु रै र्ब्र ह्म र्षि भि श्चै व श्रु त्वा य द भि पू जि तम् = su rai rbra hma rṣi bhi ścai va śru tvā ya da bhi pū ji tam

-- all four are pronounced exactly the same (and regarded as joined sandhi); it is only a matter of convention which spelling one chooses, for the convenience of the readers.

  

In many older manuscripts and inscriptions we could see either of the last two forms (either everything unbroken or everything broken); in recent years (after say 1800, with the rise of printing) one convention, especially in Devanagari printing, is to use the first form. But this practice is not universal.

  

The Sanskrit grammarians give rules on sound/pronunciation (where to pause etc); they don't give rules on printing (obviously).

When to include a visual space in the printed text is a matter of convention adopted by the writer and reader.

\- In the first form, the rule is roughly "include a space after word that ends with a vowel if the next word starts with a consonant". Note that even under this convention, a space does \*not\* denote a pause, e.g. we writeरामो गच्छति even though that's the form with sandhi (without pause) whileरामः गच्छति is the form without sandhi (pause allowed).

\- In the second form, the rule is roughly "include a space after words wherever possible to do so such that the sound isn't affected if the spaces are ignored". Here the reader must remember (or be told) to read continuously, without pausing where spaces appear: the spaces are just for convenience in knowing where (some) words end.

  

When my friend and I were assembling the first bunch of a collection of essays by him (called Sadasvada), we chose to adopt the second form and gave some reasoning at the start of the volume. (The web page where it was hosted seems to have gone offline but there's an [archived copy online](https://web.archive.org/web/20171215210015if_/http://sadasvada.com:80/Sadasvada_Print_Apr2014.pdf#page=11); also attached a screenshot.)

  

You can find much more detail (with lot of information about manuscripts etc) about such visual word-division in the 30-page introduction by Lanman, editor of the Harvard Oriental Series, when he was printing a Panchatantra text with such word-division:<https://archive.org/stream/panchatantracoll00purnuoft#page/xix/mode/1up> -- see e.g. "Hindu devices for showing word-division" on page xxiv, and "Virama in the manuscripts" on page xxxvii.

  

In short, such (purely typographical) word division is contrary to the (relatively short) \~200-year-old Devanagari printing practice, but it's definitely not contrary to Sanskrit tradition as a whole.
