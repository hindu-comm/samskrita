When the pronunciation ofसुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् andसुरैर् ब्रह्मर्षिभिश् चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् is identical, it is not possible that is one is padapāṭha and the other not. (Padapāṭha would split sandhi as in सुरैः ब्रह्मर्षिभिः च एव श्रुत्वा यत् अभिपूजितम्, i.e the pronunciation itself would change.)

  

See the related thread at<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/69maR5wwmKw/O_An86DgBgAJ> from September 2015 where (after the perfect initial reply of hnbhat pointing out that grammar does not prescribe any rule for writing), many scholars opine that writing in this form (with more word boundaries indicated) is a flaw. IMO they fall under the misapprehension that the spaces or virama have any phonetic significance (in which case it would indeed be a flaw, i.e. if you don't pronounce सुरैर् ब्रह्मर्षिभिश् चैव and सुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैव identically), for example Sri Janardan Hegde says "संहितारहितरूपस्य लेखनं दोषाय एव" but doesn't say why he considers "जानाम्य् उषे" or "वस्तुतस् तु" to be "संहितारहितरूपस्य लेखनं"; similarly Sri Korada says "if I write राम् अ , then I have to read it as it is , i e giving a pause between the two parts" but doesn't say why it is necessary to read it that way (when the whole point is that राम् अ and राम can be read identically).

Presumably they infer that a space indicates a pause / gap in reading, but as in the example of "रामो गच्छति", clearly it doesn't indicate a pause.

But whether they are right or not, it's worth knowing that many people hold that opinion or will draw that inference (chiefly because 200 years of printing have made everyone accustomed to a different convention), so if you choose to add spaces you may want to re-emphasize that spaces don't indicate pauses, and consider that you may turn off (like the previous poster who considers it "annoying") a certain section of your audience for the benefit of others.

  

There's also a related thread from around the same time (2015) showing that manuscripts did use ad-hoc punctuation to indicate word boundaries: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/SnXQyc5o0Ek/fiq_9aSBCAAJ> (as also pointed out by Lanman as I linked in my previous reply here.)  

  

At least, more or less everyone agrees that writingसुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् rather thanसुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैवश्रुत्वायदभिपूजितम् is a modern development (albeit one that most are willing to accept).
