That's a good explanation, Shreevatsa. Thanks.

  

Regarding the examples in your email -  

1\. सुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् =surairbrahmarṣibhiścaiva śrutvā yadabhipūjitam  

2\. सुरैर् ब्रह्मर्षिभिश् चैव श्रुत्वा यदभिपूजितम् = surair brahmarṣibhiś caiva śrutvā yadabhipūjitam  

3\. सुरैर्ब्रह्मर्षिभिश्चैवश्रुत्वायदभिपूजितम् =surairbrahmarṣibhiścaivaśrutvāyadabhipūjitam  

4\. सु रै र्ब्र ह्म र्षि भि श्चै व श्रु त्वा य द भि पू जि तम्

  

In my opinion, option #1 makes the most sense. If a word is extremely long, then introducing a couple of hyphens is helpful. Option #2-4 hamper correct reading. I understand the temptation in using #2, especially for beginner readers. If they want to read existing material, they will have to get used to reading text written in #1 anyway. In that sense, I don't know what problem #2 solves. Moreover, the unintended effect of #2 is to introduce mini pauses where there are spaces.
