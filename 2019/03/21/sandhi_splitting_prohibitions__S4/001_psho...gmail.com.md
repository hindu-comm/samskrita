Wikipedia entry on Sanskrit grammar has a section titled phonology and Sandhi:  
  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_grammar#Phonology_and_sandhi>  
  
It concludes with, "Thephonological rules which are applied when combining morphemes to a word, and when combining words to a sentence, are collectively called sandhi "composition". Texts are written phonetically, with sandhi applied (except for the so-called padapāṭha)."

  

So, can we conclude, perhaps a bit simple-mindedly, that the text you presented might be some sort of padapāṭha?

  

More on padapatha here --><https://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?q=padap%C4%81%E1%B9%ADha> (tinyurl --><http://tinyurl.com/y4kejolb>)

  

I also remember reading (in a grammar book) that sandhi rules are optional and that, though optional, they're almost always applied.

  

If we already know how to split sandhis etc, this kind of text (like the one you presented) can be a bit annoying to read, don't you agree? :-)
