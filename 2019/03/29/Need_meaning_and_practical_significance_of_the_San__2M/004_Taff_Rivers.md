Ganesh J. Acharya,

**  
**

 For the**practical** significance of the Sanskrit terms "param drshtva" you need to turn to J.H.Woods for his commentary on the Yoga Sutra of Patañjaliwhich includes

Vyāsa'scontribution.

  

Essentialy, there is a mental hierarchy. What follows should give you the **idea.**

  

Patañjali I. 17 Vitarka-vicāra-ānanda-asmitā-rūpa-anugamāt samprajñātaḥ.

  

Vyāsa:

Now when the fluctuations of mind-stuff have been restricted by these two means, how are we to describe the \[ensuing\] concentra- tion conscious \[of an object\]?

  

17\. \[Concentration becomes\] conscious \[of its object\] by assuming forms either of deliberation \[upon coarse objects\] or of reflection \[upon subtile objects\] or of joy or of the sense-of-personality.

  

Deliberation (vitarka) is the mind-stuff's coarse direct-experience (ābhoga) when directed to its supporting \[object\].

  

Reflection (vicāra) is the subtile \[direct-experience\].

  

Joy is happiness.

  

The sense-of-personality is a feeling (saṃ-vid) which pertains to one self \[wherein the Self and the personality are one\].

  

Of these \[four\] the first, \[that is, deliberation\] which ***has \[all\] the four associated together*** is concentration deliberating \[upon coarse objects\].

  

The second, \[that is, reflection,\] ***which has deliberation subtracted \[from it\]*** is \[concentration\] reflecting \[upon subtile objects\].

  

The third, \[that is, joy,\] which has reflection subtracted from it, is \[concentra-tion\] with \[the feeling\] of joy.

  

The fourth, \[that is, the sense-of-personality,\] which has this \[joy\] subtracted from it, is \[concentration\] which is the sense-of-personality and nothing more.

  

All these kinds of concentrations have an object upon which they rest.

  

After having mentioned the means (upāya), in order that he may state what-may-be-obtained-by-these-means {upeya) in all its variations, he asks \<\<Now . . . by these two means?>\>

  

17. \[Concentration becomes\] conscious \[of its object\] by assuming forms either of deliberation \[upon coarse objects\] or of reflection \[upon subtile objects\] or of joy or of the sense-of-personality.

  

Since ***\[concentration\] not conscious \[of an object\]*** is preceded by \[concentration\] conscious \[of an object\], he describes first concentration \[conscious\] of an object. The generic-nature of \[concentration\] conscious \[of an object\] is to be learned from its association with the forms of deliberation and of reflection and of **. . .**

 

 Hope this helps.
