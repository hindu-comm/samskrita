‡•ê

What exactly are the meaning and practical significance

of the Sanskrit terms "param drshtva" which is informed by God

in Bhagavad Gita in 2-59, due to which a person overcomes

sensual desires?

Those who understood the practical significance correctly, it will

be great if you could also inform whether you have also overcome the

sensual desires that you face. It will help us realize whether you have

actually understood the correct meaning.
