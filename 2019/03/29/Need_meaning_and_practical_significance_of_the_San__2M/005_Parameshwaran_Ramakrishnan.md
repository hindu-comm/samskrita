Very nice.

Enjoyed reading all the answers to the original question from Ganesh Acharya *-*

What exactly are the meaning and practical significance

of the Sanskrit terms "param drshtva" which is informed by God

in Bhagavad Gita in 2-59, due to which a person overcomes

sensual desires?  

All the suggested answers are good but, the question is about the theoretical understanding of the theology (knowledge of the God, the Param) in it and its practical application. All that we learn from textual studies on this "Param" is theoretical.

-   In the first place, Mahodaya Ganesh Acharya, what made you ask this
    question on"param drshtva?"

My answer would depend on your answer - I am trying to see if you will find the answer in the place from where your question arose

धन्यवाद:
