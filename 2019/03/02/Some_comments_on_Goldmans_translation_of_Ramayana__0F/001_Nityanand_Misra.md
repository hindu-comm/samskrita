For those who may not remember, the context is this. Last year, in a[tweet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/audreytruschke/status/987062962010640384),Audrey Truschke infamously claimed that Sita calls Rama a “misogynist pig” in Valmiki’s Rāmāyaṇa. In her defence, she put up screenshots of the translation of the*Yuddhakāṇḍa*by Goldman et al. Somebody wrote to Prof. Robert Goldman to get his views, and Prof. Goldman wrote back saying he found it “extremely disturbing but perhaps not unexpected” that Truschke used “such inappropriate language and passed it off as coming from Valmiki”. This email was leaked and subsequently published in an[article](https://swarajyamag.com/culture/the-scholar-whom-audrey-truschke-cites-finds-her-tweet-shocking)on the website Swarajya magazine. Truschke was facing a lot of heat on Twitter already, and this rebuke from Goldman becoming public compounded it. Truschke wrote an article in[The Wire](https://thewire.in/religion/the-many-criticisms-of-rama-and-the-anger-of-the-hindu-right)ranting about anger of Hindu right \[sic\], in which she admitted that characterisation of Sita calling Rama a “misogynist pig” was “a failed translation”. However, for reasons best known to herself, Truschke pointed out that Goldman had translated the word*śailuṣa*\[sic, the correct word is*śailūṣa*\] as “pimp”, and added that this showed that “stilted and formal English” is not the only way to translate Valmiki. Truschke conveniently avoided saying anything about whether she agreed with Goldman’s translation or not (“Whether or not I agree with Professor Goldman’s translation in this case, …”). The*ashtavadhani*poet Dr. Shankar Rajaraman and I had responded to her article in The Wire in[an article](https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/lost-and-failed-in-translation-audrey-truschke)on Swarajya, where the word*śailūṣa*was not discussed in detail.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
