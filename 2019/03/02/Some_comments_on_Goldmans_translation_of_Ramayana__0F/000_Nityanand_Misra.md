Dear list members,

  

A while ago, there was a great discussion on bvparishat list regarding Prof. Robert Goldman’s translation of*kṛtajña* in VR 1.1.2, and how the word has been ascribed incorrect meanings in St. Petersburg dictionary and Monier-Williams.

  

In this video discussion (part 1 of a 3-part series) with Sh. Rajiv Malhotra, I have offered some comments (including comments on*kṛtajña*in VR 1.1.2) on the translations of first five verses of VR by Prof. Goldman, comparing them with translations of the same verses by Gita Press, Hari Prasad Shastri, and Griffith.

Part 2 of this series will have my comments on the questionable and controversial interpretation of the word*śailūṣa* as“a pimp” and*śailūṣī*as a “a prostitute” by Goldman (something which Audrey Truschke cited as evidence \[sic\] to show that“stilted English” is not the only way to translate English while defending her indefensible and reprehensible “misogynist pig” mistranslation.

  

Part 3 of this series will have my comments on the translations of some verses from other books of the Vamiki Ramayana by Sheldon Pollock, Robert Goldman, Sally Sutherland Goldman, and Barend van Nooten.

  

Your comments and feedback are welcome, as always.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
