sastry,

  

 You could just as well say that Indian people utter English words very differently from the English.

  

You seem to be wanting to script different *dialects*, as in a narrative?

You will find that there are standard Unicode numbers for those precomposed characters that you mention.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_below>

  

However the likes of Windows operating systems has all this capability already built in:

Bring up Window's Character Map utility to the Desktop, point to the required character with the mouse.

Click on it, then simply drag 'n' drop it to where you want it.

Both you, and your readers will need to have a font with such characters,already installed on their systems. e.g. TT Gentium Book Basic.

  

*Typing* a large varieties of characters in any script is always tedious due to having to know the correct key combination.

  

Viz. "Dis is dah house dat Jack built" said Shamus, informatively.

Whereas Shamus would be quite at home reading the conventional English:

"This is the house that Jack built".

Which would also be how he would *write* what he spoke.

  

Add a few Egyptians, Bengalies, Arabs...

  

What is more, you would have to invent each dialect as you go, and test it out on the natives!

  

I matters such as these, I would be starting researching at the top - with publishers, and work down to the Authors and their typing systems.
