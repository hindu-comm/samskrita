Hi Mr Bhat,

It is not an "invention" per se. Microsoft provides a keyboard layout composer. We can create a new layout for whatever set of unicode points we want. Yes, agree no need to transliterate your mother tongue when you are wriring for people whose mother tongue is the same. But I have a different use case in mind. This layout is a first step to it.

  

thanks

Sastry
