sir,

  

In windows os, we can enable devanagari and other INSCRIPT key boards in the "language and Region" settings. They don't need any copy/ pasting from another web page. However, windows does not have a romanization alpbhabet key board built in to it. The keyboard I created works like regular multi lingual keyboard.

  

on the system tray, it appears as English (Indian) - with Romanization.

  

To type ā, ë, ī, õ, ū, one has to press and hold right alt key and press a,e,i,o,u respectively.

  

other characters that are enabled by pressing right alt and shift+ right alt are shown in the README file in the github page link given

  

Thanks

sastry
