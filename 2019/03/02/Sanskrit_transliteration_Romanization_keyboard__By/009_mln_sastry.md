Hi,

  

Yes, Indian people do not utter English words the way English people do.

  

However, my focus is on the needs of Indians for Indian words. We have more consonants and vowels; the 26 alphabet of English is not sufficient for our needs. How do I convey to a English reader the right sound without equivalent alphabet?

  

The ISO15919 standard defines the additional characters for proper romanization of Indic words.

  

Windows provides special keyboard layouts for French, German, and other languages. But there is no layout for ISO15919. I made one for that.  

  

A keyboard layout is more efficient than the insert special symbol method you mentioned

  

Other romanization systems try to fit Indian scripts into 26 alphabet of English. In myopinion they are inferior to ISO15919.

  

I would request that you install the keyboard layout and give it a try. If you already know a better and faster way to type romanized sanskrit, please let me know.

  

thanks

Sastry
