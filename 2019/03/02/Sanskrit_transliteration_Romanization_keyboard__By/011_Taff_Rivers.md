sastry,

  

 Are you aka 'Manas Marthi from Belfast, UK?

  

If so, on the topic of novel transliteration schemes.

You would know that Irishmen do not write English like they speak it. Not even in their many novels do they do so.

They don't even do so when writing to each other.

  

And, yes I have tried it, but none of your layouts match the Microsoft branded board I work with.

  

Taff, he say, "A single mouse is worth a thousand keyboards."
