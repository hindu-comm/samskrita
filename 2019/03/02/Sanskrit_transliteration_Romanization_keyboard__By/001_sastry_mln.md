Resending with a bit of write up about my motivation to create this:

  

One of the problems I find with our Indian usage of English is that we substitute the letter D to spell ड/డas well as द/ద , and the letter T to spell the ट/ట, as well as त/త. This has become intuitive to us and we instinctively make the difference. However, the English people utter Indian words very differently. Their accent is based on the way they orient their mouth, throat, and tongue (a drawn back thick tongue). Secondly they use "th" for డ, and ద (as in "moth" and "mother"). I have observed them utter words such as "Hindu", "Damodar", "Drishti", "Tripti", as "हिंडु", "डामोडर", "ड्रिश्टि", "ट्रिप्टि ", "హిండూ", "డామోడర్ ","డ్రిష్టి" ,"ట్రిప్టి".

  

I find similar mistake done in India. People in one part of India utter other regional words wrongly. It is wrong to say टमिल. The correct way is तमिळ. Wrong to say टेंडूल्कर / టెండూల్కర్. The correct way is तेंदूल्कर / తెందూల్కర్. Same mistake with ढिल्ली. The correct way is दिल्ली. ఢిల్లీ/ దిల్లీ. These observations led me to think that we need more alphabet in English for Indian needs and more keys in our QWERTY keyboards. I found one such standard ISO15919. It defines additional alphabets for transliterating Indic languages into Roman/Latin alphabet. As part of a larger effort, I first created a custom keyboard layout that supports additional characters defined in ISO15919. It can be downloaded from <https://github.com/pikeview/Panini>

  

Please install it in your PCs and give it a try. More details in the README file in the github page.

More documentation to follow.
