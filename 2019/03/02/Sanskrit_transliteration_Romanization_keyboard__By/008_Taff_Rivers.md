sastry,

  

You need to make it clear up-front that you are concerned with such Roman characters as havea macron **below them.**

**  
**

I far as I can tell, none of the other members' multiple 'keyboards' show any evidence of having read your README.md.

**  
**

However, I said earlier, it's much simpler with just a mouse.

Serious writers may configure two mice - one left handed, along with two (or more) desktop character maps showing the required transliterations.

  

The mice should come with a wheel on top, nothing else required.

  

Regards,

Taff Rivers
