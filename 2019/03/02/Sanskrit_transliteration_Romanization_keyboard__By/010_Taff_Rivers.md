sastry,

  

I think you are missing the point.

  

*Symbols* are just *symbols.* They are symbolic *of something.* In the case of*sounds*.

 How does anyone get to know what the symbol a sounds like, or the symbol a with macron above, macron below?  
  
They do so by referring to a table that associates the symbols with their sounds.

To be found at the very start of every English book of Sanskrit.

Presumable the same applies to every Indian book.

The symbols are universal, only the associated pronunciation will vary.

  

  

One table for British English speakers

a, u as in b**u**t

ā, a as on f**a**ther  
  
Another for American English, Canadian, Australian...



I have not employed the phonetic alphabet - a learning curve in its own right.

  

Your 'D to spell ड/డas well as द/ద' does nothing to help me with pronunciation.  

  

D, x as in whatxver

D macron below, y as in whatyver...

  

Are there any book *publishers* in this forum with experience of writing in *local* scripts?
