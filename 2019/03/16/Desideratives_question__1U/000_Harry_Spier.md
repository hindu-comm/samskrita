Dear list members,

  

Is this the correct spelling and form for the present participle of the desiderative of nī  ninīṣant ?

And are adjectives formed from the desiderative. identical in meaning to the present participle of the desiderative.

For example does ninīṣu have the same meaning as ninīṣant . Do they both mean "wanting to lead".

Thanks,

Harry Spier
