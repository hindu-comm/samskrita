The present participle of नी in the desiderivative is निनीषत् crude form. निनीषन् in masculine. All present participle is derived from 3rd person plural form of Presentense which gives directly a masculine nominative and later inflected accordingly. For example

गच्छन्ति -गच्छन् - गच्छन् गच्छन्तौ गच्छन्तः

पठन्ति- पठन् etc इ and त removed.

Here in the given case

निनीषन्ति - निनीषन्

  

And yes need not to use present participle instead you can use उ which is निनीषुः which also gives the meaning about to and wanted to. If a tree is falling we cannot say tree wanted to fall but tree is about to fall.
