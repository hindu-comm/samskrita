"गोष्ठाध्वनिवहा व्रजाः "।। ३.३.३९३ ।।

"जनुर्जननजन्मानि जनिरुत्पत्तिरुद्भवः" ।। १.४.३१२ ।।

"परिचर्याप्युपासना"३ ।। २.७.८८१ ।।

"चाप्याराद्दूरसमीपयोः" ।। ३.४.८६२ ।।

अमरः in support of meaning given by Naresh.

Also व्रज place is gokula:

And not any grazing place in the world.

  

And युवद्वन्द्व is the popular divine couple of राधा and कृष्ण the कर्म of the verb परिचरितुम्.

Hope Valaria doesn't get confused by the explanation of Abhyankar.
