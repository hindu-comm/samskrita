Nearly a thousand years after it was composed, the Siddhahema-Shabdanushasanam is the most popular textbook for learning Prakrit, used by a large section of Jain saints and scholars. This book carries the original text and commentary by Acarya Hemacandra, as well as a sound Hindi translation by TN Shukla. In addition, there is a 100 page index-cum-glossary of Prakrit words, explained in Sanskrit.
