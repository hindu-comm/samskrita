Namaskara,

  

In this sentence of Gurvashtakam:

  

\[...\] मनश्चेन्न लग्नं गुरोरङ्घ्रिपद्मे \[...\]  

  

The wordअङ्घ्रिपद्मे is a compound ofअङ्घ्रि + पद्म, and I was trying to figure out what kind of samsa is this...

  

If the meanig is "in the lotus feet" it can't be a tatpurusha karmadharaya, because the main word (pada-pradhana) is अङ्घ्रि and it is not in the last position.

  

Can someone help me?

  

Thanks
