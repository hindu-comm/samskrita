After all, what is the need to translateAquarius into Sanskrit when the word Kumbha already confirms the purpose of it as per Indian astrology as said by Irene? For entertainment of translation a new word to be coined for meaning "water carrier" उदकहारी is the possible word. If it is a name, it can be popular,उदहारी is possible meaning "water carrier female. But for Astrological purposes, one could not coin a new word translated from Latin or Greek.
