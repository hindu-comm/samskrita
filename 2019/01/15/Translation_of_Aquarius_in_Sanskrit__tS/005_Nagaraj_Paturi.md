Though the symbol of Aquarius, the Zodiac sign indicates only water waves, the English name is given as "Water-***bearer"*** only.

  

# Aquarius

faint constellation and 11th zodiac sign, late Old English, from Latinaquarius, literally "water carrier," properly an adjective, "pertaining to water" (see[aquarium](https://www.etymonline.com/word/aquarium?ref=etymonline_crossreference)); a loan-translation of GreekHydrokhoos"the water-pourer," the old Greek name of this constellation.

  

So the word Aquarius seems to be close to the meaning of the Sanskrit word Kumbh, pot as water-carrier
