Nagaraj Paturi,

  

 For Khumba, please read Kumbha (these K's of mine are anglicised capitals).

One of the numerous meanings of our Kumbha is indeed urn:

 "an urn in which the bones of a dead person are collected, ĀśvGṛ. KātyŚr. ŚāṅkhŚr"

  

As required, I have offered a suggestion for a possible Sanskrit name (one that already exists) of a suitable goddess for the task.

  

Surely, a little exercise of pure imagination is in keeping with the entire mela.

  

Taff Rivers
