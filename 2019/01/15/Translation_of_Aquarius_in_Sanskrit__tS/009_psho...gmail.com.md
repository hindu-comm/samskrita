Let me start with a Mulla Nasrudinstory (source:<https://inadropofwater.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/exploits-of-mulla-nasrudin/>):

  

> The Mulla went to see a rich man.  
> “Give me some money”  
> “Why”  
> “I want to buy… an elephant”  
> “If you haven't got money you can’t afford to keep an elephant”  
> “I came here,” said Nasrudin, “to get money, not advice”



I know that you want an answer and not a counter-question. :-)

  

Yet I ask: Why do you want to translate Aquarius into Sanskrit? ;-)
