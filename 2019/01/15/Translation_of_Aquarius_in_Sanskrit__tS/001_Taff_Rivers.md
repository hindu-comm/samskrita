Sowmya K

  

 The water connection tenuous.

  

**Aquarius** was a cup-bearer - of water. And male.

  

Khumba, is an urn - of ashes - from a cremation.

The khumba mela, of which there are four different dates, just happens to take place - on water.

  

The loosely connected with cups bearing water, are the somewhat larger 'carriers of water' i.e. rivers.

And looser still, is the goddess connection - **Saraswatī**.

  

But, I'm not sure us mortals can form a new Deva.

Etymology. **Sarasvati**, is a Sanskrit fusion word of saras (सरस्) meaning "pooling water", but also sometimes translated as "speech";

and vati (वती) meaning "she who possesses" (also found in the name of Parvati, "She who has wings").

Originally associated with the river or rivers known as Saraswati, this combination therefore means "she who has ponds, lakes, and pooling water"

or occasionally "she who possesses speech".

It is also a Sanskrit composite word of surasa-vati (सुरस-वति) which means "one with plenty of water"...

... along with a few other meanings.

  

  

**Aquarius**: Jan. 20 – Feb. 18

  

Aquarius, which spans 300° to 330° of celestial longitude, is represented by the Water Bearer.

In ancient Greek mythology, Aquarius is Ganymede, the beautiful Phrygian youth who was snatched up by Zeus to become the cup-bearer of the Gods.

Aquarius is part of the Eleventh House – Benefacta (Friendship), or House of Friendship, is associated with the element of Air.

Traditionally, the ruling celestial body of Aquarius was Saturn, but has since changed to Uranus.
