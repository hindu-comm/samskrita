Sir I am only trying to understand the concept not arguing or the least in my wild imagination saying Bhattoji is a fool. Excuse me if my words wrongly suggest so..

  

I will reframe my question like this.

  

The चकार in "ञमङणनाम्नासिका च" seems to tell that apart from taalu,oSTha,kanTha,mUrdha, danta sthaana forञमङणन respectively they also have nAsika sthAna.

  

Similarly ya, va, la has taalu, dantOshTha, danta respectively. They also have nAsika sthAna and hence they could also have been of "ञमङणनाम् नासिका च " with theचकार implying they have both sthAnas..

  

In paNini siksha pls help me by quoting the part which says ya, va, la has nAsika sthaana ..

  

Regards

Shyam
