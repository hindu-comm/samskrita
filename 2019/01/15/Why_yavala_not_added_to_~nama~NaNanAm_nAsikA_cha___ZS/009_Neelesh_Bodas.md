य्, व्, ल् Do not have नासिका as उच्चारणस्थान.

These letters appear in two flavors - सानुनासिक and निरनुनासिक.

The सानुनासिक versions are written as य्ँ, व्ँ, ल्ँ. For them, the उच्चारणस्थान is नासिका, in addition to their original उच्चारणस्थान.

  

Now to your question - Why is there no separate mention of these सानुनासिक forms in the statements quoted in Kaumudi, like a separate mention of ञ्, म्, ङ्, ण् and न् ?

  

The answer is that ञ्, म्, ङ्, ण् and न् are separate letters with their distinct identity. On the other hand, य्ँ is not a separate letter, it is a भेद (type) of य् । The statements quoted in the kaumudi only talk about separate letters, not the bheda of each letter.

  

As another example, अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः does not mention "आ" (or, to that matter, अँ - The सानुनासिकversion) because "आ" / "अँ" are considered भेदाः of "अ" rather than letters with own distinct identity.

  

Hope this helps.
