"ञमङणना don't have निरनुनासिक but they are अनुनासिक only" Sir how can we say so when they are having kantha, taalu etc sthaana as part of akuhavisarjaneeyaanam kanthah etc..Shouldnt we say they are mukhasahita naasikayaa ucchaaryamaaNah varNaah..

  

Also my question is even though ya,va,la is mentioned in "अनुनासिकाननुनासिकाभेदेन यवला द्विधा", it's savarNa grAhaka sutra not vidhAyaka, it should have been part of like  

"य,व,ल ञमङणनाम् नासिका च "

  

Regards

Shyam
