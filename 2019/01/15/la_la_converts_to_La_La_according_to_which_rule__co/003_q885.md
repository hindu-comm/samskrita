Namas tē Śyāma,

  

My apologies to the people I told I wouldn't post here anymore since my knowledge is so slight. Sandhi and pronunciation being an area in which I actually do know what I'm talking about, I couldn't help but chime in.

  

la (ल) does not become ḷa (ळ). When there is ḍa (ड) or ḍha (ढ) between two vowels, it is optionally pronounced ḷa (ळ) or ḷha (ळ्ह) respectively.

  

In "agním īḷē purṓhitaṃ" (अ॒ग्निमी॑ळे पु॒रोहि॑तं), you can read as īḍē (ईडे).

  

Those who actually know Saṁskr̥ta should correct me if I am wrong.

  

Thank you.
