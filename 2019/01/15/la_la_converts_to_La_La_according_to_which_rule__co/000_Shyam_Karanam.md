श्रीराम् ।

  

As per rule similar to"रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे", ल (=la) converts to ळ (=La) when preceeded by either र or ष, as in rasAtaLa, vRShaLa etc. According to which system of vyAkaraNa is this happening? Paninian or some other system ?

  

And why did pANini exclude this important letter ळ which seems to have its own meaning different from ल and finds place in Rig Veda mantras like agnimILe purohItam etc  

  

Regards

Shyam
