The causal definition is nothing to do with Passive construction.

  

The causal of a root implies that a person or a thing causes or makes another person or things to perform the action, or to be in the condition, denoted by the root.

Examplerāmo vanaṃ gacchati= Rama goes to the forest (Non-Causal)

rāmaḥ sītāṃ vanaṃ gamayati= Rama causes or takes Sita to the forest (Causal)  
rāmaḥ bodhati= Rama knows (non-Causal)  
rāmaḥ bodhayati= Rama causes toknow. (Causal)

  

It is also employed, sometimes, to convert an intransitive verb into a transitive one. Example

rāmaḥ śete= Rama Sleeps (Non-Causal)  
mātā bālaṃ rāmaṃ śāyayati(Causal) Mother causes Rama to sleep.  

  

If you be specific with your requirements I can suggest a perfect book. When I suggest a book in the general mail, which is obvious that I don'tconsider individual interest. The general book for any Sanskrit learner or for a teacher is

The first book of Sanskrit and the Second book of Sanskrit. All the rules are given in Sanskrit.
