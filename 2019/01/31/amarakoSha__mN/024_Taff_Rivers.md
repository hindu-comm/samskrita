hn bhat and all,

  

Is the word I'm seeking\* called *prati-kṣepa (*MW664,3) as perPan. i, 3, 80?

  

Thanks,

  

 Taff Rivers

  

\* I have been trying to find the Sanskrit word that carries the sense of 'opposite'  

as found in the entry for**3. vi**in the MW which has itthat***the indeclinable prefixvi-sometimes givesthe sense of the opposite to the root.***

  

I understand that this applies to Vedic texts, but does the famous **Pāṇini**have anything to say on this matter?
