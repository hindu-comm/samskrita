श्रीमन् भट-महोदय !

Your word-by-word translation is very appealing.

I am just wondering that can be fifth case singular of

आरः रम् ārḥ ram आरः रम् \[आ-ऋ-घञ्\]**1**Brass; ताम्रारकोष्ठां परिखादुरासदाम् Bhāg.1.41.2.**-2**Oxide of iron.**-3**An angle, corner.**-4**N. of a tree (मधुराम्रफल).**-रः 1**The planet Mars.**-2**The planet Saturn.**-3**Going.**-4**Distance.**-5**nearness, as in आरात् q. v.

This is from Apte's dictionary. \<<https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?page=351>\> Thehighlighted meaning #5is very apt to the context.

आरात् क्षिपति = throws away from nearness = throws to a distance (as translated by you)
