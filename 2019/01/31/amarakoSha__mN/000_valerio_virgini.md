Dear members

  

in the<http://sanskritdictionary.com>

looking for the word आरात्  

The synonyms of the अमरकोष are shown  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/1e04830fe8a3fa/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

But I have not been able to verify the term **vismayaḥ** (3.3.250) in the versions of अमरकोष in my possession.

  

Can someone tell me where I can find that synonym?

  

thank you

valerio
