Valerio,

  

Further research reveals that there are two*vismaya*'s*.*

*  
*

In theAmarakośaand the MW:

  

 The adjective*vismaya*- free from pride or arrogance.

 The noun*vismaya*(derived from the verb*vismi)*- pride, arrogance.

  

As Sunder points out, theAmarakośais correct with its noun.

Note,the entry for**3. vi**in the MW has itthat the adjective has the indeclinable prefix *vi-* sometimes givesthe sense of the opposite to the root.

  

The toot verb*vismi*In the MW alone - to be proud.

  

**TheAmarakośadoes not give synsets for verbs.  

  

So, the[http://sanskritdictionary.com](http://sanskritdictionary.com/ "Click to open in a new window or tab http://sanskritdictionary.com/")is quite **correct**.

  

You have not said where you got yourआरात्from, that prompted you to look for synonyms in the first place.

  

Regards,
