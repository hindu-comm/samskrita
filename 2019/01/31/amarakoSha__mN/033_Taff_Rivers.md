Valerio,

  

There isvismaya the noun and there is***vi-smaya*** the adjective.

  

As an adjective, the prefix ***vi-*** is used in the sense of '*opposite*' (*prati-kṣepa*Pan. i, 3, 80).

  

 **In the MW, page 953, col 1**, we findvi-smaya, an adj. to be found in the BhP, described as 'free from pride or arrogance'.

  

ārāt ==> ārta, is also there as, '*afflicted'*etc.

  

 Hope this helps,

  

Taff Rivers
