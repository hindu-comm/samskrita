Valerio,

  

 By all accounts śrī haridāsa śāstrī bābājī was himself a Bengali who wrote in Sanskrit.

  

Indeed he is said to have authored over 60 such works.

As to which one you quote a single verse from, you do not say.

  

Again, whereas I see yourआरात्, yet again you do not give any clue as to *how you related* it to the*vismaya*.

As it happens, for the reason I give elsewhere to hn bhat,,*vismaya*as the adjective*vi-smaya,*is indeed consistent withआरात्.

  

So,*how did your**vismaya make its appearance when looking for synonyms of*आरात्. presumably to understand its meaning.

As a mere male, I need all the help I can get in understanding the oblique workings of the female mind...
