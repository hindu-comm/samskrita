manaḥ – O mind; bhaja – worship; tām – that; rādhām – Śrī Rādhā; hari-dayita – the beloved of Śrī Kṛṣṇa; yā – who; tapati – burns or afflicts; rati – Rati-devī, the wife of Kāmadeva; gaurī – Gaurī-devī, the wife of Lord Śiva; api – and; līlā – Līlā-devī, the personal energy of Lord Nārāyaṇa; saundarya-kiraṇaiḥ – by the rays of Her beauty; paribhavati – (who) defeats; śacī – Śacī-devī, the wife of Indra; lakṣmī – Lakṣmī-devī, the eternal consort of Lord Nārāyaṇa; satyāḥ – (and) Satyabhāmā-devī, one of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s principal queens at Dvārakā; saubhāgya-valanaiḥ – by the superabundance of Her good fortune  
kṣipati – (and who) casts; ārāt – to a distant place;
navīna-vrajasatīḥ – the chaste young girls of Vraja;
candrāvalī-mukha – headed by Candrāvalī; vaśī-karaiḥ – by Her quality of being able to bring Śrī Kṛṣṇa under Her control.

  

please note the translation ārāt – to a distant place; in the translation with anvaya I had forwarded earlier. This is the word meaning of आरात् क्षिपति. The translation gives literary translation and not word by word translation. Here also it gives the same translation:

who dissipates the pride of the chaste young girls of Vraja headed by Śrī Candrāvalī by Her ability to bring Śrī Kṛṣṇa under Her control.  

Here also "pride" does not mean vismaya which means wonder as per AK. You can refer to any English Sanskrit Dictionary. Here the meaning is given for क्षिपति .. व्रजसतीः as a total and not in particular for ArAt.
