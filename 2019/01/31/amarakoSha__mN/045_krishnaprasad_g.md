वृद्धं is correct. Sorry for the typo.

जनेषु ज्ञानं वर्धते अणिजंतप्रयोगः which means non causal sentence. And वर्धयति is णिच् which means causal.

To all those Sanskrit learning enthusiasts, please stop reading Panini. Read modern Books. Like M R Kale Higher Sanskrit Grammar or Bhandarakar First book of Sanskrit and Second Book of Sanskrit.
