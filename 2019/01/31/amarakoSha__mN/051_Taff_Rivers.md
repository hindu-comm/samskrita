Krishnaprasad,  

  

 Thanks for the example sentences.

  

To this Englishman\*, a sentence is described as being either transitive ***or*** intransitive.

A sentence expressing **the being made to**go from the one to the other, goes by the name

'causative'.

  

As these three big words describe the noun 'sentence', they themselves carry the sense of adjectives as opposed to their other sense as nouns.

  

And as to "All the rules are given in English"

  

Despite me spelling out the difficulties that those such as myself face with most Sanskrit texts, viz. unfamiliar scripts and word meanings,you recommend the following

**  

*The first book of Sanskrit and the Second book of Sanskrit.*

  

Fortunately, I was able to obtain a sample, before buying.

I am a UK Englishman, not a Indian Englishman - that Devanagari script is useless to I.

The IAST - what's a pada, a vá¹›ddhi?

  

Can I have my money back please.
