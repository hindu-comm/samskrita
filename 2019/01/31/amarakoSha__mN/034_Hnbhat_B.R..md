I mean in Sanskrit English Dictionary the for the word ArAt = afflicted couldn't be found. And not in English Sanskrit Dictionary that afflicted is found. Here also there isn't ArAt in your image also, but a different word Artta means afflicted, in compound

  

आर्त्तःin composition; ‘afflicted with disease,’

*p. p.*व्यसनार्त्तः -र्त्ता -र्त्तं  

  

How this is related with the ArAt?
