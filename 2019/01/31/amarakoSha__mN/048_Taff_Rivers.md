Krishnaprasad,

  

Re. 'non causal sentence'.

  

That expression does not occur in the English language, neither British nor American.

I can only guess that you mean 'passive sentence'. Is that so?  

Likewise. 'causal' sentence? Active, Instrumental...

  

Sanskrit as a second language is at best, *difficult*.

On at least two levels.

 The first hurdle is Sanskrit words that are often given in the Devanagari script, which to an English reader is unknown.

Even those that make a concession by providing the IAST transliteration, fail to give any explanation as to what those mean.

Such observations apply to all such texts, not just the ones on Grammar.

  

 The other hurdle, very prevalent and relevant to the present topic, is the plethora of aforementioned meanings. A commentator simply providing ***a*** meaning of ***his*** choosing. Confusingly at odds with each other.

It is rare to come across a commentary where it's author is considerate enough to prevent such confusion by justifying his choose.

This applies to 'modern books', no less that to the medieval texts.

  

And an appeal to the 'learned ones':

Often I have been exited to read a posting In English, referencing a book or topic, with the same in English - only to find on purchasing or downloading, that they are completely in Devanagari.

  

Please accept offering as constructive criticism.

  

 Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
