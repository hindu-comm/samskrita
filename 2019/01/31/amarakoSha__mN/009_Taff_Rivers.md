Valerio,

  

 In the MW, page 953, col 1, we findvi-smaya, an adj. to be found in the BhP, described as 'free from pride or arrogance'.

  

ārāt ==> ārta, is also there as, '*afflicted'*etc.

  

 These old referencesdo appear to be a little mixed, if not at odds, but taking the context in the 'Gita into account where the chapter relates to 'selfless action',

the general idea can be gleamed.  

  

Hope I'm understanding you correctly.

  

Taff Rivers
