The Sanskrit Language doesn't care whether you are an English man or even Welshman. To motivateyou, hardly 1 month time is enough to capture any script in this world. I learned Bengali script in a week time recently. And now Mandrian and Tamil. But for the language, no good book can replace any good teacher. Because of my teacher, I learned Sanskrit withina year and for the same amount of knowledge I got in a year, people may take 20 years by self-study. A teacher will condense summarises or even refers more than 100 books in a class without naming them will give you the knowledge.
