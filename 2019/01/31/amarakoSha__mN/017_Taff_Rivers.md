hn bhat,

  

==>

Amarakosha is not a dictionary like MW which is meant for giving all the meanings, but rather a thesarus giving synonyms and has to be understood according to the scheme it was prepared and not like a dictionary.  

==>

  

I *am aware* of the structure and purpose of the Amarakośa.

  

My understanding comes fromSivaja S. Nair's thesis, available for download from:

[http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/amarakosha/amarakosha_knowledge_structure.pdf](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/amarakosha/amarakosha_knowledge_structure.pdf)

  

It is in essential in Engllsh, with diacritics but has some 'nagari.

It compares the MW layout with that of the Amarakośa, and explains the difference.

 The Hindi with the Sanskrit...

 The Vedic with the Classic...

  

Apart from anything else, such ***comparative material*** is very welcome as it provides useful insights into these ancient texts, not available elsewhere.

  

Definitions are provided, that enable readers to compare and contrast with their own language across the cultural divide, viz.

  

**Tṛtīyakāṇḍa**

  Viśeṣyanighnavargaḥ (adjective)

  Saṁkīrṇavargaḥ (miscellaneous)

  Nānārthavargaḥ (polysemous)

  Avyayavargaḥ (indeclinables)

  Liṅgādisaṅgrahavargaḥ (gender)

  

**But**, can anybody advise me here?

I have been trying to find the Sanskrit word that carries the sense of 'opposite'

as found in the entry for**3. vi**in the MW which has it that***the indeclinable prefixvi-sometimes givesthe sense of the opposite to the root.***

  

I understand that this applies to Vedic texts, but does the famous **Patañjali** have anything to say on this matter?

  

 Many thanks,

  

Taff Rivers
