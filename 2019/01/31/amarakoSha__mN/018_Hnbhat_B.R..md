Yes. I agree you know the structure and scheme of Amarakosha from the thes and its comparative use.

  

But by this how do you justify the entry in [sanskritdictionary.com](http://sanskritdictionary.com) the listing of words in Amara 3.350 as synonyms under the search word आरात् when I searched and also Valarie had searched? It's not relevant to आरात् either as meaning or synonyms either Amarakosha or MW dictionary. That's why the question was raised originally by her in the first post itself how it's right. The synonyms of word vismaya was saught to see whether आरात् has been listed anywhere in AK and to know the meaning of vismaya or आरात् in MW or any other dictionary as I understand the question. This was not clear to me also in the beginning, but Sundar helped to clear the question.
