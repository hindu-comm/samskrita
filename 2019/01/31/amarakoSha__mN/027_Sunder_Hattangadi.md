*Text 10  
*ratim gauri-lile api tapati saundarya-kiranaih*  
*saci-laksmi-satyah paribhavati saubhagya-balanaih*  
*vasi-karais candravali-mukha-navina-vraja-satih*  
*ksipaty arad ya tam hari-dayita-radham bhaja manah**

*O mind, please worship Lord Hari’s beloved Radha. with the splendor of Her beauty She makes Rati, Gauri, and Lila burn with envy, with the power of Her good fortune She defeats Saci, Laksmi, and Satyabhama, and with Her ability to control Krsna She completely eclipses Candravali and the other pious young girls of Vraja.*
