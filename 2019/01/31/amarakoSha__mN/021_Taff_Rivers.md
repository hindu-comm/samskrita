hn bhat & all,

  

There are a number of Amarakośa's, with their own numbering. But only one *explains* its structure.

I identified this as the thesis of Sivaja S. Nair, who refers to the work of Amarasiṁha . And I praised its usefulness.

  

And ***relevant to the topic*** - vismaya, I noted that the MW has it that:

वि \[ vi \] \[ ví \]3 ind.  (indeclinable (Avyayavargaḥ))

 . . .

sometimes it **gives a meaning opposite to the idea contained in the simple root** (e.g. √ \[ krī \] , " to buy " ; \[ vi-√ krī \] , " to sell " )

 . . .

  

Now, vismaya as a masculine noun, appears in the MW as vi + smaya

 where the aforementioned **opposite meaning** occurs.

As such it is a grammatical question - Pāṇini?
