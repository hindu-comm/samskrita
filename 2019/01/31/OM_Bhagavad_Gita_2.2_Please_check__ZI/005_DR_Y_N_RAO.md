Dear Acharyaji,  
  

नमस्ते !  
  

The following are the clarifications needed by you:  
  
0, ने (Subject): These Case-Endings (विभक्ति-प्रत्यय) refer to the use of 'ने'. In Past Tense, when the Verb is Transitive,  'ने' is added to the Subject, subject to certain exceptions. And, '0' indicates that owing to certain exceptions, the Suffix 'ने'  

is not added to the Subject. Since without the Suffix, this unit cannot be called as Case, '0' is implied as the Suffix here. This fact could be seen only in Advanced Grammars of Hindi. In normal Grammars, it is not mentioned with a view to avoid confusion in the minds of the learners.

  
0, को (Object) : These Case-Endings (विभक्ति-प्रत्यय) refer to the use of 'को'. In Hindi, the Suffix 'को' must be added to all Animate Objects; For Example: 'राम ने रावण को मारा ।' The Suffix 'को' should not, ordinarily be added to Inanimate Objects. For Example: 'राम ने रोटी खाई ।' In this case also, since without the Suffix, this unit cannot be called as Case, '0' is implied as the Suffix here. This fact could be seen only in Advanced Grammars of Hindi. In normal Grammars, it is not mentioned with a view to avoid confusion in the minds of the learners.  
  

Hope, this would do. You are most welcome for any further clarifications on the subject.  
  

With best wishes,
