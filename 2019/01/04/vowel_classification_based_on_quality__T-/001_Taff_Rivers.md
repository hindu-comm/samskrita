Ramana murthy,

  

==>

I think all the vowels are unaspirated.

But I need confirmation.

==>

  

Aspiration, is only the puff of air that comes *after* a 'letter', whether vowel or consonant.

It is an after-sound.

To puff or not to puff, is governed by the initial letter of the word that follows, if any.

  

==>

It will be helpful if some reference in the book is made.  

==>

  

Such rules, are provided in tabular form in rows and columns.

Often at the very start of any dictionary, not only at grammar books.

  

There are numerous such English language books.

But I don't think that you would benefit from them, as they require a higher standard of English than what your posts indicate.

  

Perhaps you should post, stating your your own language, in order to receive replies that would be more useful to you.

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
