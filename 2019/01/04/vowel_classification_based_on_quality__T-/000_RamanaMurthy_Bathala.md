Dear Sir,

  

I am preparing notes on classification sanskrit alphabet based on the quality. Each alphabet (vowel or consonant) can be classified:

  

1\. Either Voiced or unvoiced

2\. Either Aspirated or Unaspirated

  

All the vowels are voiced.

Are all the vowels unaspirated?

I think all the vowels are unaspirated.

But I need confirmation.

Please reply. It will be helpful if some reference in the book is made.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
