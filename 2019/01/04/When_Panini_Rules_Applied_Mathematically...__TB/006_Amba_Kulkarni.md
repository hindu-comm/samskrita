Namaste Ramanmurthy garu,

  

Well, but the distributivity holds good as in the case of 'anuv.rtti' in Panini.

  

You may refer to section on Anuv.rtti in my article on Brevity in Panini's Ashtadhyayii at  

<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/papers/panini_brevity_interwoven_world.pdf>  

  

best regards,

Amba
