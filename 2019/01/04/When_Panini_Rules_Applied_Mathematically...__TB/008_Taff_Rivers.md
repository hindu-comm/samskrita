RamanaMurthy Bathala,

  

==>:

The above mathematical equations giving to**Vriddhi = Guna.**  

I think somewhere mistake is done.

  

==>

  

  

 Are you are missing something?

  

1\. Those rules only apply to *the process of composing Sanskrit*.

  

2\. And only to combinations of vowel letters *between words*.

  

3\. As to the the reverse process of *decomposing* such compositions.

  

   There can arise the major problem due to ambiguity.

   For example, when the blended vowel is the long aआ,

   what was the original pair of a's?

  

अ + अ

अ + आ

आ + अ

आ + आ

  

In such cases, the matter can only be resolved by the composer him or herself.

If that is not done, endless are the disputes...

  

The faculty needed one of mental deduction, not one of logic, mathematical or otherwise.

  

You may wish to locate such a pair of words, yourself to so *decompose*.

  

Regards,
