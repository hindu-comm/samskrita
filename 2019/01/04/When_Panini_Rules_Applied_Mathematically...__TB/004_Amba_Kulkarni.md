Dear Ramanamurthy garu,

  

You are assuming that associativity hold good.

  

a+(b+c) = (a+b)+ c

This is called law of associativity.

  

However, in the case of Sandhi, this rule does not hold.

You will notice this especially in the case of verb formation with upasargas.

  

That is the reason, we need to appeal to 'pUrv-anitya-antaranga-apavaadanaam uttarottara baliiyasi'.

  

Best regards,

Amba Kulakrni
