Respected Amba Kulkarni ji,



Thanks for identifying the mistake done by me.



In fact, you have brought back my high school maths to memory.

In the given case, associative law does not hold good.



Even the commutative law also does not hold good in case of Sandhis.

As per commutative law: :

(a+b) = (b+a)

अ + इ is not same as इ + अ

अ + इ = ए

इ+ अ = य

So commutative law also does not hold good.



The mistake I have done is applying algebra learnt at high school days. Should have forgotten once left the school.



Regards

Ramana murthy
