Dear Ramanamurthy garu,

  

If you must consider in light of "addition", then you ought to take into account the "vector addition".

Using 'vector addition',

 a + b NOT= b + a

In sandhi, not only the gross sound (uccaraNa) is considered but other factors as implied in the setting of Maheshvara suutra sequencing.

  

regards

Krishna
