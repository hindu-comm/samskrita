Pranams Nareshji,

I had this view "अतः 'एम्पथी'-वान् जनः समदुःखसुखः भवितुमर्हति"in mind when I was looking for it. But in the transactional world समदुःखसुखः is considered as "indifferent". He doesn't exhibit परार्थाऽभ्युदयकर्माणि He may be basically an introvert in his expression.

Your first paragraph is meeting the requirement but do not have a word either derived from a root or as a samasthapada.
