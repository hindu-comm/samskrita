Aurobind Padiyath,

  

I read that 'there here is no common Sanskrit term for the concept “emotion”.

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concept-emotion-india/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concept-emotion-india/)

  

And there is no *word* as such, to be found by Googling or searching in MW's English to Sanskrit lexicon.

However, there is a *description* given in the YS., where it is *expressed as a particular state of mind:*

*  
*

   I. 33 Maitrī-karuṇā-muditā-upekṣāṇām sukha-duḥkha-puṇya-apuṇya-viṣayāṇām bhāvanātaḥ citta prasādanam.

  

Hope this helps,

Taff Rivers
