What you label as empathy (example with ramp) has sometimes been called compassion.

The difference is allegedly that empathy=capacity to put oneself in another’s place

and feel what they feel, whereas

compassion=ability to feel as in empathy plus acting to help.

Either way, some reactivity is there: if the ramp builder doesn’t know what physical

disability is, he wouldn’t know whether to respond with building a ramp or doing something else.

In addition, a ramp wouldn’t address all physical disabilities, let alone non-physical ones,

so it’s a specific response to a specific stimulus.
