Except that your inference is directly contradicted by the explanations in Vachaspatyam which does show a word dayaa, that eminently captures the definition of empathy. Please see Sunderji's email which showed the relevant extract. Instead of using readily understood words or existing words like that of Kalidasa and the like, if one insists on making up दुरूह्य words like अनुजिजीविषा, I don't know what purpose is achieved.  

  

Of course there are many words without equivalents in Samskrit, e.g., car, bus, train. Neither do many Indian languages.  

They solve the problem by simply borrowing the English word.  

In the same vein, Samskrita Bharati uses car-yaanam, metro-yaanam, etc. in Samskrit. That seems perfectly sensible to me.

  

In some cases, it may be possible to find Samskrit words or usages that are very closely related. If that is the case, one can use them and expand the sense of the word in Samskrit itself.  

For example, several dhAtus have acquired sakarmaka status even though they may have been akarmakas previously, e.g., krID.
