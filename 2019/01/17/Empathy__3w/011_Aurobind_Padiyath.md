नमस्ते श्री मोडि महोदयः।

सह+अनुभूतिः in Vachaspathiyumअनुभवे तद्विवरणमनुभवशब्दे दृश्यम् । “अनुभूतिश्चतुर्विधा प्रत्यक्षमप्यनुमितिस्तथोप- मितिशाब्दजे” इति भाषा० ।

Here the word अनुभूतिः is an internal experience of प्रमाणं-generated and resident in the knower. It's not his expression which is empathy. I agree for empathy to be felt prama is a must. When you say सहानुभूति the validation of prama in both the parties is a tricky one and what is the means of verification of the same?

That gives us situation either the word Empathy is not really there or is not practical.

Even the word सर्वात्मभावः more of an esoteric in nature, not an expression.

संवेदना = किसी की वेदना देखकर स्वयं भी बहुत कुछ उसी प्रकार की वेदना का अनुभव करना Is a Hindi word and is leaning more towards sympathy May be there is no exact word in Sanskrit. (Because it is not possible?)
