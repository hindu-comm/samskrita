Reminds me of a saying that goes something like this - having heard Ramayana all night long, he asked in the morning, "what is the relationship between Rama and Sita?"

  

If you ignore all the options provided in the thread, sure there is no word for empathy. So let's recap - here are the options offered.  

  

सहात्मानुभवः    

सहानुभूतिः

परदुःखदुःखित्वम्  

दया / करुणा  

समदुःखसुखः  

संवेदना  

  

Shriimaan Padiyath rejects all these options saying the following:

  

सहात्मानुभवः- because it is supposedly "more esoteric in nature, not an expression." (Huh? Just because you hear the word aatma, you don't jump to vedanta or esoteric thoughts.)  

  

सहानुभूतिः - the reason for rejecting this is some confusing argument about prama must be felt / not felt / validated / verified / commonly verified.  

  

परदुःखदुःखित्वम् - because it only refers only to sorrow  

  

दया / करुणा - because it is not a samastapada or that it is supposedly not derived from a root (you only have to look up a kosha for the etymology; and why only samastapada? Go figure.).  

  

समदुःखसुखः - because it supposedly doesn't exhibit परार्थाऽभ्युदयकर्माणि and denotes introvert. I clearly refuted that providing an example of its usage in context. In response? Silence. And where does the requirement of परार्थाऽभ्युदयकर्माणि for empathy come from? Unclear.  

  

संवेदना- free form assertion " a Hindi word and is leaning more towards sympathy." Err, it is a Samskrita word.  

  

  

FWIW, it is not अध्यासं but अध्यासः. It is not Vachaspathiyum but Vachaspatyam ( वाचस्पत्यम् ).

Hmm... what's the word for a troll in Samskrit? I wonder ...

  

  

Naresh
