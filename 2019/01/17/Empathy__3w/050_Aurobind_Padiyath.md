Let me explain what I was trying to convey.

  

Empathy is definitely not sympathy or दया

  

For example if we see a physically challenged person trying to climb steps and the feeling that prompt us to respond is sympathy. Where as a socially responsible person when we provide ramp or elevator keeping in mind the difficulty of such people in our mind we are becoming empathetic.

If we analyse the process of the incorporating the ramp etc, we can see that the designer lives through the same situation of the physically challenged individuals and sees through the requirement from his understanding of what he "thinks" that will be going through the mind of the challenged person. This desire to be in the shoes of the challenged person and the arrival at the design requirement is an act of empathy. He is not sympathizing during the process nor is he sad to be affected by it.

  

So the following words are a reactive in nature and not a proactive effort.

सहानुभूति

अनुकंभा

दया etc..

I used the उपसर्ग अनु keeping in mind अनु करणं, अनु शोचनं, अनु प्रवेशं

Etc and the word जिजीविषा to capture the meaning of 'desire to live',
with the उपसर्ग - अनु become 'like'. A "desire to live like(in the shoes)".

  

This was my thought process and question.

Empathy has larger context than the example given above.

But basically it is a apparent desire of living through the life of another so as to have a better understanding of what he is experiencing so that we respond in a more appropriate manner than assumed conditions.

  

If there's anything wrong in this I would like to be corrected.
