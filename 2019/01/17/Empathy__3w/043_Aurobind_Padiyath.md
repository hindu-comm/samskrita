Thank you Sunderji for the article.

Quote: "Empathy is the decidedly younger term, at least in English. Moreover, though “empathy” is favored over “sympathy” in modern discourse (for reasons we will explore), it rose to prominence and accrued new meaning in a field—psychological aesthetics—which for many of us no doubt remains unfamiliar.

  

Unquote:

This puts in a nutshell the reason why Sanskrit is yet to coin a word for it.

As also like H N Bhatt Sir mentioned, there won't be words for all foreign words in Sanskrit. We may be in a cusp of time to get a new word as the usage creeps into Sanskrit usage.

Thank you

Aurobind Padiyath
