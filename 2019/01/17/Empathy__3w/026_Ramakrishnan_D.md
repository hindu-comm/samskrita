Dear Mr Irene,

As has been explained by all others on this word in this group, I understand the word 'empathy' denotes experiencing the feelings of joy or sorrow and expressing the same to the opposite person with whom he is dealing.

"sahAnubhUtiH" may tally with 'empathy' is my opinion. Thank you.
