Nareshji,

जिजीविषा may not be the right word, it was only a suggestion.

Your reference Webster says:

"the imaginative[projection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/projection)of a subjective state into an object so that the object appears to be infused with it"  

  

I used desire in place of imaginative projection, not desire in the common parlor.

  

सुखःदुःखं is not a sum total of human experiences. There are better terms like सर्वभूतहितैरथः

  

I hope you also agree that both empathy and sympathy are not synonyms.

I may like to close this thread with the understanding that at present there is no equivalent word, even though based on the context different words may be used to suit the aspect of empathy that's being addressed.

Thank you all.

  

Aurobind Padiyath
