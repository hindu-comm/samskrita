 Actually, the oldest language on record are the cuneiform script that was discovered in Mesopotamia that dates back to 8th millennium BC.

A very much pre-Indus civilisation. Presumably they spoke what they wrote.

  

To be non-indocentric with the facts, Panini was a citizen of a region in the Indian continent known as Pakistan, before there was any such a country or republic of India.

  

Arabic, BTW, is not an offshoot of 'Samskritum'.

  

Again:  

There is a difference between compounding existing stem words in ways that have not been so compounded before,

and the combining of existing letters in a way that have joined before.

Or even employing new letters. I understand that there are 200 vowels plus 600 consonants currently employed in the world at large.

  

X marks the spot. Yes, but.. Oh, that spot!

It's reusable too.
