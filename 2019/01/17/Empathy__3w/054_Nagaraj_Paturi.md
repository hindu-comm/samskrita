I wanted to locate where your misunderstanding of sahaanubhooti lies.

  

Now I got it.

  

' Resonate ' is a verb. ' to produce ' also is a description of an action , of meaning of a verb.

  

Sahaanubooti is a noun. Like empathy, it is a noun.

  

Saha means ' along with' ' with' etc.

  

Metaphorically Saha means 'in the same way as' .

  

Anubhooti means experience / experiencing.

  

Sahaanubooti means experience/ experiencing along with somebody or in the same way as somebody.
