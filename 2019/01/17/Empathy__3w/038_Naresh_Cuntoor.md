Taff,  

  

At least you could be consistent in copy/pasting from secondary or tertiary sources. The previous article you quoted from the plato.stansford website claimed that there is no word for emotion in Samskrit. The author mentioned rasa in the beginning and inexplicably ignored it before reasserting at the end of the article that there is no word for emotion.  

  

Now in the above extract, you refer to a source that translates rasa as emotion. Yes, empathy is not one of the nine (or eight or ten) rasas. But the feeling of empathy is recognized as a thing in itself in Samskrit literature as discussed elsewhere in this thread.

  

Is empathy considered an emotion or just a feeling? If compassion, pity, sympathy are all feelings, then I fail to see how empathy becomes a more general state of emotion.  

  

There isn't one commonly agreed list of emotions in English either. This Philosophy 101 class does not even distinguish between emotions and feelings -
