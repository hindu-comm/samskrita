Aurobind Padiyath,

  

You ask "how do we validate the frame of reference for understanding...(*of Empathy*)"

  

We evoke such feelings on a play on the stage, Shakespearedid it well, but in the Śāntam rasandian performing arts:

  

A रस rasa is a sentiment or emotion evoked in each member of the audience by the art.



Those emotions are enumerated:

Śṛungāram (शृङ्गारं): Romance, Love, attractiveness. Presiding deity: Vishnu. Colour: light green

Hāsyam (हास्यं): Laughter, mirth, comedy. Presiding deity: Pramata. Colour: white

Raudram (रौद्रं): Fury. Presiding deity: Rudra. Colour: red

Kāruṇyam (कारुण्यं): Compassion, mercy. Presiding deity: Yama. Colour: grey

Bībhatsam (बीभत्सं): Disgust, aversion. Presiding deity: Shiva. Colour: blue

Bhayānakam (भयानकं): Horror, terror. Presiding deity: Kala Ratri. Colour: black

Veeram (वीरं): Heroism. Presiding deity: Indra. Colour: saffron

Adbhutam (अद्भुतं): Wonder, amazement. Presiding deity: Brahma. Colour: yellow

  

But () Empathy is not acknowledged,andRetro-filling the blank () is to falsify history...

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
