Aurobind Padiyath,

**  
**

"Can a word be coined using अनु + जिजीविषा ?"**  
**

**  
**

Were **you** to put yourself in the place of the reader of your proposition (in other words

to emphasise with your reader),

*what would you make of such a word* (how would you interpret the word).

  

Your अनु + जिजीविषा will appear to readers as अनुजिजीविषा

(anu + jijīviṣā will appear as anujijīviṣā)

  

I think you would find that not a single one makes any sense, whatever script you use to do so.

  

I stand to be corrected, should you provide such a **valid** interpretation.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers
