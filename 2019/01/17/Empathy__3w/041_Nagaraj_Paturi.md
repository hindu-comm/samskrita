In Rasa theory in Alankaara s'aastra , bhaava is the word used for emotion. Rasa is the word used for the ecstatic, transcendental and transporting experience resulting from the combination of 1. the stable /principle emotions and 2. unstable/subsidiary emotions, 3. the characters holding the emotions , 4.objects enhancing the experience of emotions and 5. enactment/descrition of voluntary and involuntary actions expressing emotions.

  

sahaanubhooti is empathy and sahaanubhooti of the audience with the characters, i.e., empathy of the audience with the the characters holding the emotions is considered to be leading to Rasa in the audience.

  

Because this is a context dealing with emotions, it may lead to an impression that sahaanubhhoti is only an emotional empathy. But the word sahaanubhooti , in fact, refers to all kinds of empathy in general in a broader sense. Here in the case of explanation for Rasa, it is being used in the sense of emotional empathy as a special case of that broad sense.
