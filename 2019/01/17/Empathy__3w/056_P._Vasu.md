Hello,

Perhaps the information claimed at

<https://www.etymonline.com/word/empathy>

on the origin of the word “empathy “ in 1908 from a German word - itself coined in 1858 purportedly from a PIE root - may help in coining a term in Sanskrit if none of the existing terms seem adequate.

This exercise may be useful and effective if “mirror neurons” and their remote firings make this effect a “real” thing and something that had been "realized" in many cultures

  

Hope this is of some use

  

Vasu
