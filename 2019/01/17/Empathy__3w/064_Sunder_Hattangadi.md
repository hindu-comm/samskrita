Ramana Maharshi used a laconic and evocative phrase -

abhidA bhAvanA (Upadesha-saram v.#8)

  

" bhedabhAvanAt so.ahamityasau \|

bhAvanA.abhidA pAvanI matA \|\| "

  

" भेदभावनात्सोऽहमित्यसौ \|

भावनाऽभिदा पावनी मता \|\| "

  

It may be paraphrased as 'sAyujya bhAvanA', or 'nirastabheda bhAvanA'
also.

  

Survivors of natural or human-made disasters do not have to imagine how other similar survivors feel. Their own memories

qualitatively and quantitatively vastly differ from the rest.
