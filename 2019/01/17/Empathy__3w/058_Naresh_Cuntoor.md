Please provide a source to support this claim (an English source, that is).

  

Sympathy and empathy are both reactions to something experienced by someone else. Empathy goes a step further than sympathy by invoking an experience in oneself in response to another. It does not stop at recognizing the thoughts and feelings of another. Look at Merriam-Webster again and tell us where you see it as a "proactive effort".  

  

Please re-read the explanation from the Raghuvamsha Tiikaa-  

समदुःखसुखः इति । त्वद्दुःखेन **दुःखी**, त्वत्सुखेन **सुखी** इति टीकाकारः ।

दुःखम् अस्य अस्तीति दुःखी, सुखम् अस्य अस्तीति सुखी  

This person who is समदुःखसुखः is becoming a दुःखी or सुखी because of another's दुःखम् or सुखम्. So clearly, this refers to empathy again (or more correctly, to an empathetic person).

  

In this sense, the word offered by Sharada varyaa, परदुःखदुःखित्वम् is suitable as well.  

  

The crucial distinction between sympathy and empathy is whether the person is able to simple recognize another person's feeling, or recognize and experience it. The former is sympathy and latter, empathy.  

This distinction is captured by the दुःखी/ सुखी / दुःखित्वम् parts in the above alternatives.

There is no such word in Samskrit.

No, it isn't. Please go back to Merriam-Webster. Empathy is not "an apparent *desire* of living (vicariously)". It is the capacity for experiencing the feelings and thoughts of others.  

  

An empathetic person does not desire the pain (or joy) of others. He is simply capable of experiencing others' pain (or joy) as though his own. Subsequently the person may choose to act further or not. In the example of building ramps, an empathetic person can mentally experience the need for ramps even though he may not physically need it himself. Whether he then builds a ramp or not is irrelevant as far as his ability to empathize with the situation.  

  

So the usage of sannanta जिजीविषा is misplaced.

  

Perhaps you want to coin a word for an "empathetic action". The instance of Dilipa-simha sambhashana is relevant for this purpose.

  

Dilipa attempts to invoke empathy from the lion to recognize his predicament. Here Dilipa is not asking for sympathy from the lion, but says यशःशरीरे भव मे दयालुः." And who is the lion that Dilipa is requesting? The lion had told him that he is no ordinary lion - कैलासगौरं वृषमारुरुक्षोः पादार्पणानुग्रपूतपृष्ठम् अवेहि माम् किङ्करम् अष्टमूर्तेः ". Surely such a lion knows the importance of कैङ्कर्य, and यशः among other things. Now if you read this beginners' sarga, perhaps you will make more informed progress in your attempts at finding the right words to use.
