Dear Ramakrishnan,  
  
I don't disagree with you, but here's why I've asked Aurobind for the  
sentences he wants to translate.  
If it's just a single mention of the word 'empathy', we could see from  
the context which of the numerous Sanskrit words suggested in this  
thread would be suitable. If, on the other hand, it's a paragraph  
that, say, compares and contrasts empathy, sympathy, and compassion,  
then we'd better see the text and proceed carefully.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
