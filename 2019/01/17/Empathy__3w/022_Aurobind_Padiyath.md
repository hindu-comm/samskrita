**Empathy**is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from "within their frame of reference", that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.

((Having said this, how do we validate the frame of reference for understanding is another question)).

First let's see if there is any equivalent word or phrase.

If there's nothing to closer how is that we in Sanskrit didn't coin any word for it?
