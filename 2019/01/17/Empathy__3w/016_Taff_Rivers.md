Aurobind Padiyath,

  

 By now it should be becoming clear to you, that there is no such*word*for the emotion*empathy.*

  

Sanskrit lexicons are lacking words for emotions in general.

  

There are *descriptions* to be found, which should help convey that particular emotion. One such description I provided.

  

As to why such words are lacking, I have a theory.

As the literature states,

  there is a threefold aspect - to words:

   the word, which exists outside and inside the mind, in spoken and written form.

   the idea of it, which exists only inside the mind as a concept or understanding

   the corresponding reality, which exists out there, outside the mind able to be seen by all.

  

The difficult with an emotion, is that it does not have a corresponding reality, out there.

That bit is missing.

  

But as always, there are ways to work-around the problem.

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
