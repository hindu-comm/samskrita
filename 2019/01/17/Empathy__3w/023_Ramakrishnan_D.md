Dear Sir,

Samskritam is the oldest language in the world. Therefore, all other languages are all offshoots of it only. So there is question of coining the equal word to

"empathy". I definitely feel that"सहानुभूतिः" is the the most appropriate word for that.

I am really sorry to have expressed so bluntly, because this argument is going on days together.
