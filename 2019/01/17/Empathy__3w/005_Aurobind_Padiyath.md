Pranams Sharadaji,

परदुःखदुःखित्वम् is only one aspect of empathy towards sorrow.  

Even though by definition the word अतस्मिन् तत् बुद्धिः may be said as अध्यासं it's still from परदृष्ट्या, but it can't be used as a word for Empathy. One can't say " A bit of empathy towards them will go a long way in uplifting their living standards" by using the word अध्यासं
