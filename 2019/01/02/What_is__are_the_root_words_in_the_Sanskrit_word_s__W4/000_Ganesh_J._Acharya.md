Looking for  
  
1. The root word/s in the Sanskrit word**svargyam**

  
2. Its/their precise meanings.  
  
Have already looked up atWILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY.  
  
Posted this query here since I didn't find. To be honest, I have glanced it carelessly. I have an eye problem so I cannot stress a lot with sources beyond a point. So, I am not being lazy, just being careful.  
  
Also looking for more sources of root words, if there are any.
