Dear ABC (no physical person ?)

  

संस्कृत-पठन-पाठनकी अनुभूत सरलतम विधि (Experienced and Easiest Course for Learning and Teaching Sanskrit) is a set of two books - authorship of the first is ascribed to पं. ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासुand of the second to युधिष्ठिर मीमांसक, who was possibly the closest disciple ofपं. ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु.

From the सूत्र-सूची in Part 1, I counted 512 सूत्र-s referred to. My count of सूत्र-s in Part 2 came to 1066. Total number of सूत्र-s from both the parts together works out 1578. (I presume there are no duplicates.)

I made the count to check what becomes the minimum number of सूत्र-s, one must study to get a good enough grasp of संस्कृतम् as per the संस्कृत-पठन-पाठनकी अनुभूत सरलतम विधि Experienced and Easiest Course for Learning and Teaching Sanskrit.

The subtitle on Front cover of Part 1 says बिना रटे 6 मासमें अष्टाध्यायी-पद्धति से संस्कृत का पठन-पाठन (Learning and Teaching Sanskrit in 6 months, without cramming, byअष्टाध्यायी-method).

I think the method is made to look attractive by the two phrases "in 6 months" and "without cramming". I would think that both these phrases are questionable.

Cramming usually refers to memorizing शब्दरूपाणि and धातुरूपाणि.

From what I have observed when glancing through the two books, the method advocated there requires learning and memorizing the recommended सूत्र-s, which becomes a substitute to memorizing शब्दरूपाणिand धातुरूपाणि.

I am left to contend that memorizing शब्दरूपाणिand धातुरूपाणि is much easier, especially, if one has a good list of शब्द-s and धातु-s to be memorized.

There is a mention in Part 1, that one should learn all 10 ल-कार-s of पठ् भू एध्.

I think that most common ल-कार-s are only 5 - लट् लङ् लृट्लोट् and विधिलिङ्. That would reduce load of rote-learning to half.

Mr. GSS Murthy has given शब्दरूपाणि for a good selection of शब्द-s at \<<http://murthygss.tripod.com/Sabda_1.htm>\>.

For धातु-s also, there are good details at \<<http://murthygss.tripod.com/dhaatumanjarI.htm>\>.

I also like धातुरूपाणि provided by Mr. Neelesh Bodas for almost all धातु-s in धातुपाठ and that too in all 10 ल-कार-s, at [www.ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/](http://www.ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/)

On having such a good repertoire of शब्दरूपाणि and धातुरूपाणि, one needs to learn then, the technique of using them appropriately for constructing sentences.

For constructing sentences, a Translation method is often loaded with risk, because one needs to understand constructional peculiarities as practiced in the two concerned languages. For example

in English "change of voice" from active to passive or vice versa applies only to transitive verbs. But in Sanskrit there can be change of voice for intransitive verbs also.

-   Most repertoire available for धातुरूपाणि would not give धातुरूपाणि
    on change of voice. -   In Sanskrit there are उपधातु-s for 12 different usages as causative,
    desiderative, frequentative, etc. Most repertoire available for
    धातुरूपाणि would not give धातुरूपाणिfor such उपधातु-s.

Also in English one uses verbal auxiliaries such as may, might,must, can could shall will should could. In Sanskrit one has कृदन्त-s to effect such translations.  

My glancing through the two parts of संस्कृत-पठन-पाठनकी अनुभूत सरलतम विधि (Experienced and Easiest Course for Learning and Teaching Sanskrit) do not convince me that such details of learning Sanskrit to be able to construct sentences are adequately treated there.
