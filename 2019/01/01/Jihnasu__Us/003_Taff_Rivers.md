ABC,

  

Re*The Tested Easiest Method of Learning & Teaching Sanskrit,* if that is what you mean.  

  

 As already mentioned, the book itself is in print.

  

In any case, please note that *The Tested Easiest Method of Learning & Teaching Sanskrit*actually consists of two books.

First Book has English mixed in with the Devanagari.

The follow on Second book is in Hindi.  

  

It is ***not*** easy. It my well ***have been easy***before the digital age. Six months full time is not easy!

  

More importantly it is a ***teachers*** handbook. It *instructs the teacher* how to teach the language that he is already competent in.

  

A teachers training college gives a student three years of full time training -how to teach- in a subject that they already know.

Considering that it takes three years to train a native English speaker to qualify as a certified teacher...

  

I have the First Book. The reader will need to know his Sanskrit words i.e. be able to ***read*** Sanskrit,***and*** have a Sanskrit copy of the Ashtadhyaya to hand. Each sentence is doted with Sanskrit words which are not not translated, indeed, they are not even rendered in Roman transliteration.

  

Don't waste even your time.

Beware of the publisher hype.
