Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Ekadashi** falls on the **Christian Era New Year 2019** (tomorrow 01-Jan-2019), I am delighted to attach a short sweet prayer by **Radha** on **Lord Hari** taken from **Brahma Vaivarta Puranam, Krishna Janma Khandam, and Chapter 27**. The brief **Phalashruti** mentions that one who chants this hymn for a year with devotion becomes equivalent of Lord Krishna Himself in terms of his qualities and bestows true devotion and servitude to the Lord. What more does one want for the new year and years to follow?

  

**May I take this opportunity to wish you a very happy and prosperous new year! May the attached hymn be always on your tongue and mind that shall bestow the true wealth and characteristics. May all your rightful wishes be fulfilled beyond your wildest imaginations!**

  

May The New Year also usher in an era of spiritual unity among the followers of Sanatana Dharma - for Santana Dharma is indeed at a very precarious crossroad and cliffhanger. It will be a cop-out to point the fingers outside as the root cause of the malady is deep rooted inside -
in terms of apathy, silly intra-sect rivalry, lack of practical wisdom despite paper qualifications, lack of unity and you name it. This is honestly the moment every asthika needs to pause and see whether his/her actions promote the overall well-being of the Sanatana Dharma and take course-corrections. 2018 has surfaced many an ugly side of the Sanatana Dharma followers - exact anti-thesis of Sanatana Dharma itself.

  

**May Lord Bless each and one every one of us regardless of our leanings such that Wisdom, unit and peace will prevail. Happy New Year once again.
