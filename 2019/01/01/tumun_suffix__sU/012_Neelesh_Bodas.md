There is nothing called internal and external sandhi, and any software that shows such a distinction is misleading you, period.

  

What your sandhi software might be trying to convey(or what you might be trying to visualize) is the difference between पदान्तकार्य and अपदान्तकार्य . Some rules in संहिताधिकार can be applied inside a word. Some others can only be applied between two words. Many can be applied in both situations. For example ने+ अन --> नयन (अपदान्तकार्य, uses एचोऽयवायावः), but वने+ अस्मिन् --> वनेऽस्मिन् (पदान्तकार्य, uses एङः पदान्तादति) ।

  

It does help in some way to segregate the संहिताकार्याणि into पदान्त and अपदान्त, but please note that there is no fixed rule which favors one over another.
