ashtadhyai website gives the derivation of क्रोष्टा (<http://www.ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/01.0992?form=#plut0>)  
  
Final steps are shown here:

  
\<snipped>  
→ क्रोश्+ता \[पुगन्तलघूपधस्य च [7\|3\|86](http://www.ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/7/3/86) \]  
→ क्रोष्+ता \[व्रश्चभ्रस्जसृजमृजयजराजभ्राजच्छशां षः [8\|2\|36](http://www.ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/8/2/36) \] -- (a)  
→ क्रोष्टा \[ष्टुना ष्टुः [8\|4\|41](http://www.ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/8/4/41) \] -- (b)  
→ क्रोष्टा  
  
Because a similar derivation yields क्रोष्टुम्, we can say that 2 sandhi rules are involved in the final stages, marked (a) and (b) above. In this derivation श् changes first to ष् and this ष् then causes त् at the beginning of ता to change into ट्. Note that rules shown as 8.2.36 and 8.4.41 in the snippet above are hyperlinks you can follow. When you look at the examples under each of these, 8.2.36 appears to be an internal sandhi rule whereas 8.4.41 appears to be a general sandhi rule (applicable both within a word and across words. for example, under 8.4.41, you find an example such as रामस् + षष्ठः = रामष्षष्ठः, which seems clearly to be an external sandhi application). But I'm not sure whether this division of internal and external is clear-cut.

  

Perhaps experts can explain this better.
