क्रोष्टुम्  
  
You can use the form of लुट् लकार as your basis to arrive at thisतुमुन् form.  
  
@ <http://ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D_1> (tinyurl --> <https://tinyurl.com/y7bfmrzt>), when you look under लुट् section, you'll find : क्रोष्टा  
  
This form (लुट्) is arrived at by adding ता to the root क्रुश्

  

It seems therefore that adding तुमुन्will yield क्रोष्टुम्
