नमस्ते रमणमूर्ति-महोदय !

सेट् is स+इट् and अनिट् is अन्+ इट् where इट् means आगम of इ. Such आगम of इ is called as इडागम.

Note, इटः आगमः इति इडागमः(षष्ठी-तत्पुरुषः). In compounding इट्+आगमः becomes इडागमः

So, if a धातु is सेट् (स+इट्) then सिद्धि ofits तुमन्त will certainly haveआगम of इ.

To my mind the problem is different than this. भू+इ should be भ्वि But it is becomingभवि (भ् + अ + व् + इ)? Where did अ come from ?

In क्षि becoming क्षेतुम् the process seems to be क्षि (क्ष्+ इ)=> (क्ष्+ अ+ इ =) क्षे. Where did अ come from ? क्षि (क्ष्+ इ) already has इ in it. So it seems logical that another इ need not come in. It then sounds logical, that क्षिis अनिट्.

For क्षि becoming क्षेतुम्, the grammatical explanation is इ in क्षि becomes ए, where ए is गुणादेश of इ.

We can say that गुणादेश is the grammatical process where vowels इ ई उ ऊ get preceded by अ. This precedence of अ i.e. गुणादेश implies or has inherent in it आगम of अ.

But the अ in भवि (भ् +अ+ व् + इ) is not any गुणादेश. It merits different explanation.

When glancing through धातुपाठ I get to notice that most हलन्त-धातु-s are सेट्.

The सेट् \>\< अनिट् distinction is more for अजन्त-धातु-s.

Among them इ-कारान्त धातु-s are usually अनिट्, which is logical, but would often suffer गुणादेश e.g. क्री => क्रेतुम्, प्री => प्रेतुम्, नी => नेतुम्

धातुः कृ (क्+ ऋ) is अनिट्, Its तुमन्त कर्तुम् has in it क्+ अर्+ तुम्, where अर् is to be taken as गुणादेशof ऋ.
