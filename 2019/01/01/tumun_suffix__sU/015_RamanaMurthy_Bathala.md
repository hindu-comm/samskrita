Dear Sir,

  

I could not properly articulate my question in the beginning. I will try to put in a better way.

**Preliminary Rule (To be observed before applying the Sandhi):** The stems of nouns and the roots of verbs may end in almost any letter, and these final letters (whether single or conjunct) are allowed to remain when the crude words stand alone; but complete words, when they stand alone or at the end of a sentence, can only, according to the native system, end in one of nine consonants (or, including Visarga and the Anusvara substituted for final m, eleven), viz. क्, ट्, त्, प्, ङ्, ण्, न्, म्, ल्, Visarga (:), and Anusvāra (ṃ); and even stems of words not ending in one of the above eleven letters are liable to undergo changes which shall make them so end, before the process of their euphonic union with other suffixes and other words in sentences is commenced.

The above allowable final letters are shown the below table with their background shaded for easy grasping.

  

[TABLE]



Q: What should we do if the last letter of a word does not end in one of the 11 letters mentioned?

Ans: It should be changed to corresponding unvoiced and unaspirated letter in the same row (same source of pronunciation) or to the nearestpossible.



Now the word in question is क्रोश्. The ending in श् which is not one of the 11 letters mentioned. So it has to be changed to one of them. But श् is palatal. The unvoiced and unaspirated consonant in its class is च्. But च् not allowed as this is not in the one of the possible 11 letters. So what is the nearest to it? So we have to select the nearest possible to च् . One row above it we have क् and one row below it we have ट्. So in place of च्, we can select either क् or ट्. So the final श् of क्रोश् can be replaced by either क् or ट्.

From Max Muller, it it clear that radical श् should be changed to either क् or ट्.

So क्रोश् changes to either क्रोक् or क्रोट्

But as per the <http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/>8/2/36,

व्रश्चभ्रस्जसृजमृजयजराजभ्राजच्छशां षः

The final श् changes to ष्. So क्रोश् changes to क्रोष्

Now two possibilities:

|        |                  |                    | |--------|------------------|--------------------| | Root   | Preliminary Rule | Panini Rule 8.2.36 | | क्रोश् | क्रोट् or क्रोक् | क्रोष्             |



Does Panini’s rule 8.2.36 supersedes the Preliminary rule?

This is the exact question I was asking.

Once this is resolved, then next question of adding तुम् comes.

  

Dear sir, please confirm whether Panini rule supersedes the preliminary rule.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
