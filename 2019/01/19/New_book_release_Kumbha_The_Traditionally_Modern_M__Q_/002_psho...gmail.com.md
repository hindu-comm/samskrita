Before we pick up anything by the BBC, we must acquaint ourselves with their ways and ask ourselves whether anything fair might be expected of them, especially when it comes to their treatment of other religions, other peoples, other countries, etc.

  

And where else can you find such information than in Wikipedia!

  

Search 'BBC criticism' and you come to this wiki entry:

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_BBC>  

  

Scroll down a bit and you come to a section titled, 'Anti-Hindu bias':

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_BBC#Anti-Hindu_bias>  

  

Here's a line from this section: "Anything that may show Hinduism in a poor light is immediately picked up by the BBC programme makers, while anything that may show Hinduism in a glorious light remains ignored by the BBC."

  

We can thus assure ourselves, without watching even one frame of such a BBC documentary, that it won't be worth our time.

  

We've our own writers (such as Misra Ji) and I'm sure we've our own shows produced in India on Kumbha Mela. When such resources are available, why should we subject ourselves to mistreatment and humiliation by the BBC?
