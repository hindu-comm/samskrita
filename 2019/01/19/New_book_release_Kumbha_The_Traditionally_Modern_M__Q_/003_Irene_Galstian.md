Sadly, that danger is real.

I have an English compilation of bits of the Upanisads somewhere. 

The editor cheerfully explains in the introduction

that he distilled everything useful to the reader from the Upanisads

and omitted the irrelevant.

Made me wonder whether he would have done the same

to the Gospel of John.
