Re. ***Traditionally Modern***

  

Ladies and gentlemen, the ***full story*** please!

"In the India, there have the two society’s i.e. traditional culture and modern society." *stet*: *is for have*!

In other words , those having a tribal viewpoint as opposed to those of a cosmopolitan one.

The same applies in the world at large.

  

Traditional societies

**Traditional culture refers to the small scale societies.** It is the ancient practice of the community. It derived from the indigenous. It is the element of communities.

  

Modern societies

**Modern society refers to the large-scale organizations.** Today, in the world the modern societies co-exist for development. It is that practice which relates to the industrial mode of production.
