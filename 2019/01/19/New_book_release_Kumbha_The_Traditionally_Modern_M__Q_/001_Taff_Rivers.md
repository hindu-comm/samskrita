Nityanand Misra,

 For those interested, there have been quite a few, hour long English language documentaries in recent years.

 especially BBC documentaries of various Kumbha melas.

I don't know if they are available outside the UK, for copyright reasons.

Googling for "kumbha mela BBC documentary" is instructive.

  

BTW, it does not equate to Aquarius,as inquired elsewhere. The dates do not compute!
