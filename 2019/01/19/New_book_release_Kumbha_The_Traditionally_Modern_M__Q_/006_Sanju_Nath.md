I find “outsiders” and “insiders” a more meaningful categorization when it comes to studies concerning Sanatana Dharma.

  

insiders: practioners of hinduism backed by immemorial Guru-Shishya passed understanding of her deepest truths which has respect for Vedas as an important ingredient.

  

outsiders: non-practioners of hinduism who learn and study Vedas and related writings without the benefit of Guru-Shisya parampara. Aim is to criticize, be irreverent with radical interpretations.

  

I look at the writings of

<https://www.sringeri.net>, <http://www.chinmayamission.com>,

<https://www.sivananda.org> and many such places,

and studies offered under such sites as

<http://www.bvbdelhi.org/indo/ins_indo.html> far more credible than bbc or similar reporters and documentaries to understand aspect of hinduism.

  

For more comprehensive discussion on outsiders and insiders one can refer to:

Thank you.
