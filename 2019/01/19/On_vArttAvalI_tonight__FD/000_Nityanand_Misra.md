Dear list members,

Watch me speak about the Kumbha Mela on TV tonight in the weekly news magazine ‘Vārttāvalī’. At the producers’ request, I spoke in both Sanskrit and Hindi to reach more people. Subtitles will be in Hindi (for the Sanskrit part) and Sanskrit (for the Hindi part).  

Telecast time

My segment is around 10-12 minutes and will start 5-10 minutes after the show begins.

Repeat telecasts

Wed (23 Jan) 11:00 am IST on DD Bharati

The show will be available on YouTube in 2-3 days

  

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
