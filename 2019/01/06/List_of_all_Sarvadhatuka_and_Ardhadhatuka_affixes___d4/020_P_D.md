Shri RamanaMurthy Mahodaya,  
Namaskarah,  
  
I apologize if I am replying to the wrong thread, but since you included Excel table here I want to share by two bit on formations.  
  
From a fellow student like you, I appreciate the conflicts faced by you but at the same time, I feel you should take the advice from the experts in the correct spirit because they all might have faced similar conflicts but they overcame those conflicts successfully so are sharing their experiences to enlighten us. Also a question to ponder, have we have learnt enough to question the wisdom of Panini?  
  
Additionally, being a beginner is no excuse of being non-scientific in our approach to find a solution in deriving the correct form.  
  
I am sending the following information on the basis of my understanding and from the notes from Webinar on कृदन्ताः from Vyoma Labs and am thankful to Dr. Sowmya Krishnapur for her excellent presentation on this subject. Mistakes if any are my own and I will be thankful to the learned members' comments& corrections so I could improve my understanding.  
  
Your excel workbook should have many more variables and checks before unilaterally adding इ and तुम्. I did not understand your intention to add इ for all Verbs that you listed in your table! You have assumed forms like भवि, एधि should be the input?  
  
Did you want to restrict your derivation to forms like, पठितुम्, लेखितुम्, भवितुम्, हसितुम्, खादितुम् only and discard the Verbs which will have forms like कर्तुम्, श्रोतुम्, नेतुम्, दातुम्, हन्तुम्, द्रष्टुम्, भोक्तुम्?  
  
If not, I feel the input should be the original form of verbs listed in the धातुपाठः, or a drop down list allowing user to select a Particular verb. But you have to add Columns to identify if a Particular verb is सेट् or अनिट्? What are the Operations on the Original form of the verb before any प्रक्रिया, or a कृदन्त can be applied and what is the modified form of the verb. Also add columns to differentiate if the modified verb ends in Vowel or Consonant, What is the last letter of the verb form? What is the penultimate letter of the verb form?  
  
तुमुन् प्रयोगः is predominantly for क्रियार्थ क्रिया by answering किमर्थम्. It is also used to answer किं कर्तुम् इच्छति, किं जानाति, किं शक्नोति, किम् अर्हति, to indicate capability by words like समर्थः, निपुणः etc.,  
  
Before addition of इट् = इकारः आगमः (इडागमः) one has to know that the location will be in between the धातु and प्रत्ययः (वन्द् इ तुम्), Only certain suffices are qualified to have इडागमः, A suffix starting in a Consonant other than य. Even the verb has to be classified in सेट्, अनिट or वेट्  
Please NOTE: अनिट Verbs with इट् qualified suffix will not have इडागमः (Example: आप्तुम्) and वेट् Verbs with इट् qualified suffix will have optional इडागमः (मोहितुम्, मोग्धुम्)  
  
**सेट्**

1.  After modifying the Original verbs in forms like पठ्, वन्द्, उह्,
    खाद्, चल्, धाव्, इक्ष्, खाद्, जीव्, नट्, निन्द, you can directly
    concatenate “इ”and “तुम्” to get correct forms of तुमुन् 2.  For modified Verbs ending in Vowels इ, उ, ऋ, (इगन्तानां धातुनां) you
    have to apply गुणः

शी इ तुम् – शे इ तुम् – शयितुम् (एवमेव - श्रि, डी,)  
भू इ तुम् – भो इ तुम् – भवितुम् (एवमेव - क्षु, नु भू, लू, पू, सू)  
जागृ इ तुम् – जागर् इ तुम् – जागरितुम्

1.  For modified Verbs with Penultimate letter as ह्रस्व इ, उ, ऋ you
    have to apply गुणः

Examples: लिख्, मिल्, विद्, क्लिश, मिद्, मुद्, शुच, रुद्, स्फुट्, मुष्, नृत्, वुध्, हर्ष्, भृज्, वृष्

1.  For modified verbs ending in दीर्घः ऋकारः after applying गुणः,
    optionally forms with both इ and ई are possible. Example: तरितुम्,
    तरीतुम् 2.  All णिजन्ताः verbs are सेट् therefore चोरयति will have a form
    चोरयितुम् and similar with यितुम् at the end.

**अनिट्**

1.  For modified verbs ending in आ or with penultimate letter of ह्रस्व
    अकारः, तुम् is directly added to get correct form. Examples: दातुम्,
    पातुम्, आप्तुम्, तप्तुम्, वस्तुम्, हन्तुम् 2.  For modified verbs ending in ए, ऐ, ओ, औ (एजन्तानां) the last vowels
    will change to आकारः & then तुम् is directly added to get correct
    form. Examples: गै – गातुम्, (ध्यातुम्, ह्वातुम्, वातुम्, त्रातुम्
    इत्यादयः) 3.  For modified Verbs with Penultimate letter as ह्रस्व इ, उ, ऋ you
    have to apply गुणः Examples: इ, जि, चि, नी, क्री, भी, श्रु, स्तु,
    हु, प्लु, द्रु, ध्रु, क्रु, भृ, मृ, हृ, स्मृ 4.  For Modified Verbs with last letter as a Consonant you have to
    follow rules of हल् सन्धिः to arrive at final forms like अत्तुम्,
    गन्तुम्, त्यक्तुम्,

I hope for your success in your endeavor.
