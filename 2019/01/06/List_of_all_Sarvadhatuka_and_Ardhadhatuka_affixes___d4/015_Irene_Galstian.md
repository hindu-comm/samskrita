Be honest with yourself, Ramana murthy. You have been trying your own  
method for a good few months now. Are you satisfied with your  
progress? If yes, keep going, don't listen to anyone. If not, consider  
trying other options. We're all mortal in the end. Whatever we choose  
to do, one day our time will run out.
