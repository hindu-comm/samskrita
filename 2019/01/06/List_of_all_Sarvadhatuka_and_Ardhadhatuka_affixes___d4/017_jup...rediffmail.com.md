Shri RamanaMurthy Mahodaya,

Namaste,

  

A few books from this link will be quite useful to clear many doubts you have.

But I too feel it is necessary to learn the language before the grammar. A mother does not teach the child the rules of grammar in the first instance does she?

Without knowing the संज्ञा, परिभाषा, सन्धि, कारक & समास if you plunge into Ashtadyayi, it will be very difficult to appreciate the Brilliance of Panini.

  

HTH
