Ramana murthy,

  

 You do keep asking unintelligent questions.

  

It is like you are asking "how many Words in English have the suffix ed".

(As it happens, one answer gives 18,720 words.)

  

Even is there was such a Sanskrit list, what would you want such a list for?

In the case of the English list, it is a special list for those who play the Scrabble Word game.

  

But what is your purpose in asking?
