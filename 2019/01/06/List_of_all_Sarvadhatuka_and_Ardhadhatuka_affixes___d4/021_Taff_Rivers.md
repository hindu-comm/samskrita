PS Hoopla,

  

 It's not the questions, it's the answers.

  

Education comes at a cost, financial and of time.

There, one discovers answers to questions that one didn't even know existed.

  

It is only after all that study, that one gets in a position to evaluate it's worth.

  

Some has a practical value: First Aid.

Some has entertainment value: plenty of that in the Sanskrit literature.

  

Taff Rivers,

  

You have my permission to ignore this fine wisdom of mine, as you please.

  

But do speak up if you spot any dangling participles in my Grammar.
