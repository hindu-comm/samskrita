Ramana murthy,

  

-   A massive knowledge gap is apparent!

     1. What you are wishing for has been available for decades, and is ongoing.

       <https://sanskrit.inria.fr/index.en.html>

       The program code is available on request.

  

     2. A spreadsheet like Excel is not a programming language!



     3. Sanskrit Grammar.

  

-   A massive skill gap is apparent.

     It also very much requires a rather different skill - problem solving.

     Problem solving of any kind is a creative process.

     It is very much a **DIY** process.
