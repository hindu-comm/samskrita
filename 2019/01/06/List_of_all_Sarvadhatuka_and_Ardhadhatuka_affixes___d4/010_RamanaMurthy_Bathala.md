Dear Sir,



Thanks for links and feedback.



I would like to inform respected scholars and members I post query for information only after all my resources / options at my disposal are exhausted.

  

1#I started studying "ASHTADYAYI OF PANINI" in the order of sutras given.



1.1.1 वृद्धिरादैच्

1.1.2. अदेङ् गुणः

1.1.3. इको गुणवृद्धी

1.1.4. न धातुलोप आर्धधातुके



1# I have no problem in understanding upto the first three sutras. I faced problem at fourth sutra which introduced the word आर्धधातुके. What is अर्धधातुक?



Question: Did Panini give definition of अर्धधातुक in the first earlier three sutras?

Answer: No.



Question: Then how can student understand meaning of अर्धधातुक?

Answer: ???



Since we have internet and books in archive, we can search online and find it.

3.4.113 तिङ्शित्सार्वधातुकम् ।

3.4.114 आर्द्धधातुकं शेषः ।



The definition of आर्धधातु is in the 3.4.114

Currently I am reading first book and 4th sutra. To understand आर्धधातु , I have to jump to the 3rd book. Ok let us see what is the definition given there.



Question: What is the आर्धधातुक affix?

Answer: If the affix is not सार्वधातुक, then it is आर्धधातुक.



Question: Is the answer given direct?

Answer: No. If I need to understand आर्धधातुक, I need to first understand what is सार्वधातुक. The definition of सार्वधातुक is given in 3.4.113. I think, even there, to understand सार्वधातुक, I have to understand new words. It is a chain and I do not know where it ends.

So...

To understand sutra 1.1.4., need to understand आर्धधातुक

To Understand आर्धधातुक, need to understand सार्वधातुक

To Understand आर्धधातुक, need to understand .....



How much time and resources, I have to spend to understand one word आर्धधातुक ?



Now the pertinent question is:

Is graded learning possible in Sanskrit?

Obviously No.



Respected अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः sir, tried to touch this in his post [simplesanskrit](https://simplesanskrit.wordpress.com/):

"For learning of Sanskrit to become graded learning, it came to mind that .... "



So can ASHTADYAYI OF PANINI be learnt in graded manner?



2# Secondly, I worked in the IT domain. I have little bit of knowledge of scripting and programming.

There are some day to day mundane tasks which does not require skill but only time and patience. These task can be easily automated by scipting languages like javascript or VB script or through inbuilt formulas in Excel.



For example how to form the तुमुन् form of dhatus. This can be automated in Excel if we know knowledge whether the Dhatu is सेट् or अनिट्. These सेट् or अनिट् are called attributes which are essential to automate the task to the possible extent. Below is the one I have prepared for my self to form तुमुन् forms . (Please see the original excel sheet with formulas used for my study)

After reading upto 1.1.4. न धातुलोप आर्धधातुके, I came to understand that some roots undergo gunation and some does not undergo gunation depening on the affix, whther it is सार्वधातुक or आर्धधातुक and whether this affix causes elision of a portion of a dhatu. All this requires attaching attribute सार्वधातुक or आर्धधातुक to each and every affix. Then only further automation can be done. Since I do have this ready-made information, I asked for help if someone has already has such information. This is the background for this post. Only thing I have not explicitly mentioned my background requirement.

 This attribute to affix is important in computational linguistics.

Please just have cursory look the only markings to understand the importace attributes like Set / Anit, S/A

3# Final I would like to say something about the my way of learning sanskrit. I am not soliciting any comments on this, this would deviate the purpose of my original question. Also to keep the sanctity of this group. Respected scholars are advising the learning sanskrit in particular way. But it does not suit everyone. It depends on the persons background and culture.

 Few years back, at the beginning of learning sanskrit, I went to Sanskrita Bharati office, Koti, Hyderabad. I saw the office staff speaking only in Sanskrit. During the course of conversation, they told me they teach Sanskrit through Sanskrit only.



 First I do not know sanskrit, They are going to explain in Sanskrit. Imagine this. I do not know German. Someone start teaching me in German. How much Knowledge I gain**? Gandhiji told education should be taught in Mother tongue.**

 What I mean is that the method adpated or advised by scholars does not suit everyone. So let student learn in his own way.



When a student asks a question, the context under which he/she is asking may not be explicitly mentioned in the question. I request scholars to help providing relevant information without speculating or concluding the context of question and help spreading divine language to the extent possible .
