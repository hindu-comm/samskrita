Both make sense. But differently. In the first it is a nominal verb from the compound समधिगतसर्वार्थ with णिच् suffix making it a verb it meaning "to make it (the eleven verse group)समधिगतसर्वार्थ (all the meaning of them very well understood). In the second, it is an adjective to the compound  मनःशिक्षादैकादशकवर

Hope this makes the meaning clear. In this case, this compound itself " the group of which the whole meanig is understood well".

  

Hope the meaning of other words are clear to you.
