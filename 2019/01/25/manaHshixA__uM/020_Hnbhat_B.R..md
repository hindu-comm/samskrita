It is notअर्थय in 10th conjugation groop is not conjugated as parasmaipada, but it is conjugated as aatmanepada as अर्थयते etc. This verb derived from the compoundसमधिगतसर्वार्थ is derived conjugated as parasmaipada as समधिगतसर्वार्थयति etc. The presise meaning (who) makes (the best of eleven verses W) understood the whole meaning.. ..(by himself).

  

  

There is another nounअर्थalso which also takes णिच् suffix nominalized and conjugated as parasmaipada but with a different form and meaning as अर्थापयति.

  

The commentary seems to have the other reading 'samadhigata-sarvārtha-tati' but I couldn't read it as it is in Bengali script. The member is requested to give devanagari transliteration of the commentary on the relevant portion.
