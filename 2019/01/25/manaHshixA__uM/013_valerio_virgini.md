Dear scholars

  

in this last verse of मनःशिक्षाthere is a compound that I do not understand:

  

मनःशिक्षादैकादशकवरमेतन्मधुरया

गिरा गायत्युच्चैः समधिगतसर्वार्थयति यः ।

सयूथः श्रीरूपानुग इह भवन्गोकुलवने

जनो राधाकृष्णातुलभजनरत्नं स लभते ॥१२ ॥

  

In particular, the problem is represented by the termअर्थयति  

  

सम्-अधि-गतfully understood; completely understood;  

सर्वeverything; every  

अर्थयति(this looks like a verb अर्थणिजन्त कर्तरि लट् प्र एक परस्मैपदी)

  

Are there any cases in which a compound ends with a verb?  

  

Furthermore, to complicate the matter, there is also another version in which this compound is:  

  

समधिगत-सर्वार्थ-तति

  

Do they both make sense or is one of them wrong?  

  

Thank you very much!  

valerio
