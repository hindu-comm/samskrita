First of all thanks bhat ji and thanks Abhyankar ji.

  

I think it's right "the spiritual master, the leader of those who are dear to the lord",

but the first term could also be a bahuvrihi? "those to whom Lord is dear"?  

  

Moreover this compound is singular and there is concordance with सः

If it had been a द्वन्द्वwould have been dual? (प्रभु-दयित-समन्तौ)  

  

  

Finally, साधुप्रेमाI think it is correct to read it as a compound.  

  

The poet assimilates the desire for fame to a woman of low caste (impure).

  

Is it possible that sadhu, for coherence with the comparison, refers to a saintly person?

Prema is similar to a saint, and therefore does not go to unclean places.

  

(in this case what kind of samasa is?)  

  

valerio

  

p.s.

In this link, it seems a good translation.
