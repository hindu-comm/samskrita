A book on 'SRI KANCHI MAHIMA' was recently written by me as instructed by Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham; it is based on the well known Samskrit work 'Sri Kamakshi Vilasam' and a Tamil compilation titled 'Sri Kanchi Mahimai'. I am sending the book herewith.

It is also available in the website in the link:
