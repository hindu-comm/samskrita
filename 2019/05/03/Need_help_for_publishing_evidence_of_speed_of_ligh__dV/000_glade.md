Respected scholars ,  
  
I was doing research on speed of light evidence based on time calculation given in Veda and sastra and got success to get near value of speed of light given by modern science.  
  
Also tried to cross verify by changing values . And found it matches as per discription given in Veda for “Trurti” and sun light relation .  
  
I want your help to get it publish in physics journals with peer review etc process .  
  
Please provide your suggestions.  
  
Thanks  
Gaurang
