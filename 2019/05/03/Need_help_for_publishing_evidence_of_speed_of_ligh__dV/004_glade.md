Thank you all for reply. and Sorry for delay in my response.

  

I have went through references given by you.  

  

I have few questions and my understanding . Please correct me for following points

  

Regarding Yojan :

  

1)The sāyaṇabhāṣya upon it reads:



तथाचस्मर्यते-योजनानांसहस्त्रंद्वेद्वेशतेद्वेचयोजने।एकेननिमिषार्धेनक्रममाणनमोऽस्तुते॥

  
  

(It is remembered that ‘(O Sun,) obeisance to you, who traverses 2202 yojanas in half animiṣa.)





According to Bhagwat Purana : Skanda : 5, Adhaya : 21, Shloka : 19

``` लक्षोत्तरं सार्धनवकोटियोजनपरिमण्डलं 
```

``` भूवलयस्य क्षणेन सगव्यूत्युत्तरं द्विसहस्र- ```

``` योजनानि स भुङ्क्ते ॥ १९॥ ```

```

```

``` इति श्रीमद्भागवते महापुराणे पारमहंस्यां संहितायां ```

``` पञ्चमस्कन्धे ज्योतिश्चक्रसूर्यरथमण्डलवर्णनं 
```

``` नमैकविंशोऽध्यायः ॥ २१॥ ```



  

It Looks like Yojan shloka taken from Bhagwat Purana. Which still available. But there is no relation found with Rigveda . ( I do not prefer English version of Rigveda or other ancient like sastra or upanishad).

  

2) Now considering Yojan calculation are related with Human body , its calculation comes different for different persons . Take example as short Person vs Tall healthy person.

  

3) Also There is reference in Mahabharata about King who burn down "KalYavana" .

That king was sleeping since Treta Yuga and when he came out of cave in Dwapar Yuga , he found trees and human are small as compare to Treta.

  

So if we believe in this story ( history) then its difficult to Measure Yojan accurately as Human size are different in Four Yugas .

  

4) So as said in Point 3 . If Sayana correct in measuring Yojana in Kali Yuga but fail to take notice of different size of Human in Four Yuga .

  

5\) Now Mahabharat and other Puranas , Four Vedas are written by Sage vyas in Dwapar . So Yojan calculation given as per Dwapar Yuga Human size ? ( First three Yuga only Single Veda exist ).

  

6\) So Yojana calculation according to Human size is not consistence. So other Option is **Truti and Trusrenu relation** which is **" particle size to time " relation**

  

7\) **According to modern science Geography and Particles are same mostly or change very less in millions years.**

  

So if we have prove as per scientific method Option is Truti and Trusrenu relation. Which is more accurate.

  

I **have attached document of Time calculation. Its reference in Bhagwat Purana and mention "Truti " defination a fact that same happening in present day .**

  

Since as per science journals rules ( I dislike those) article must not publish earlier , which prevent me to give in depth information about my findings. But attached document give enough information and hint.

  

My only aim is to make recognize this finding as standard scientific , rather taken as mythological findings. Thus take our Veda and Puarana further for serious science research.

  

Please guide me and provide your suggestions . 

  

Thanks and Reagrds,
