(The following is a translation of an article I had written in the Marathi discussion group ‘[aisiakshare.com](http://aisiakshare.com)’ (<http://www.aisiakshare.com/node/1790>)in 2013. That article addresses the same question as in this thread.)



Ancient India and the Speed of Light.

Claims of the nature that some results obtained my modern science were also known to ancient Indian sages are often encountered. One such claim is that the velocity of light was known in ancient India and that number is very close to what modern science has discovered in the recent centuries. This claim is based on ṛgveda 1.50.4 and the sāyaṇabhāṣya upon it.

  

ṛgveda 1.50.4 reads

  

तरणिर्विश्वदर्शतो ज्योतिष्कृदसि सूर्य । विश्वमा भासि रोचनम् ।

  

(Swift and all beautiful art thou, O Surya, maker of the light, Illuming all the radiant realm.)



The sāyaṇabhāṣya upon it reads:

  

तथा च स्मर्यते - योजनानां सहस्त्रं द्वे द्वे शते द्वे च योजने। एकेन निमिषार्धेन क्रममाण नमोऽस्तुते॥

  

(It is remembered that ‘(O Sun,) obeisance to you, who traverses 2202 yojanas in half a nimiṣa.)

  

sāyaṇabhāṣya does not indicate the source of this śloka. A google search brings up several websites that say that this śloka contains India’s ancient knowledge about the velocity of light. For example, this website <https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/the-speed-of-light-rigvedic-hymn>.
According to it, the velocity of light, as discovered in ancient India, is 284883.750 km/sec, which indeed is very close to the modern value of 299792.458 km/sec (Source Wikipedia).



The same website gives the working behind this. According to purāṇas, 15 nimiṣa = 1 kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhā = 1 kalā, 30 kalā = 1 muhūrta, 30 muhūrta = ahorātra or 24 hours. Now 24 hours is 86,400 seconds, and30 muhūrtas = 405,000 nimiṣas, hence 1 nimiṣa = 0.21333… seconds or 16/75 seconds.



The same site, quoting the so-called ‘Vedic Arthashastra’ gives the units of distance of 1 yojana = 13.8 km and the distance traveled by light in 1 nimiṣa is 4404 yojanas. This translates in km/sec as 284883.75 km/sec.



I perceive the following difficulties in accepting this calculation.
Firstly, sāyaṇabhāṣya is not speaking of the speed of light but of the Sun. However, this difficulty may be resolved as follows. According to Indian Jyotisha, all planets, including the Sun (the Sun and the Moon are counted as planets in Indian Jyotisha) travel in their respective orbits at the same velocity of 11858.75 yojanas per day. (please see p.317 of ‘bhāratīya jyotiṣaśāstrācā itihāsa’ by SB Dixit. The same is also indicated in the 6^(th) śloka of ‘kakṣagrahānayana’ in ‘gaṇitādhyāya’ of bhāskarācārya.) 11858.75 yojanas per day is far small as compared to 4404 yojanas per nimiṣa of sāyaṇabhāṣya and one way of explain this discrepancy could be to presume that sāyaṇabhāṣya has the speed of light in its view and not the Sun.

  

Even after accepting this adjustment, difficulties do not disappear.
The definitions of ‘nimiṣa’ change from source to source. śloka 19-21 of the section called kālamāna in gaṇitādhyāya of bhāskarācārya has the following table: 18 nimiṣa = 1 kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhā = 1 kalā, 60 kalā = 1 muhūrta, 30 muhūrta = ahorātra from which we derive 972000 nimiṣa = 86400 seconds or 1 nimiṣa = 0.0888… second = 9/100 second appr. This is less than half of the measure found from the puranic table.

  

The section of kālavarga in amarakoṣa gives another definition as 18 nimiṣa = 1 kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhā = 1 kalā, 30 kalā = 1 kṣaṇa, 12 kṣaṇa = 1 muhūrta, 30 muhūrta = ahorātra. This gives 1 nimiṣa =0.0148 second.



A similar absence of unanimity and exactness is also found in respect of the measurement of distance ‘yojana’. According to līlāvatī, 4 hasta = 1 daṇḍa, 2000 daṇḍa = 1 krośa, 4 krośa = 1 yojana but how much is one hasta? If we take it to be 18 inches, then 1 yojana = 9.09 miles. If it is 24 inches, then then 1 yojana = 12.12 miles.



The truth of the assertion about the knowledge of the speed of light, presumed to be available with ancient Indians, requires acceptance of these several compromises. Are we willing to go that far?



Many websites aver that Dr S.Kak is also supportive of the claim. A close reading of Dr Kak’s paper, 'The Speed of Light and Puranic Cosmology'available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9804020>, shows that he has attempted to explain how the concept of sāyaṇabhāṣya, of 2202 yojanas in half nimiṣa could have arisen. He has not endorsed it anywhere and calles it a ‘lucky chance’. His last paragraph reads as under:

  

> > "We have provided a context in which Sayana’s speed can be > > understood. In this understanding, the speed of light was taken to > > be 2×182 greater than the speed of the Sun in standard yojanas so > > that light can travel the entire postulated size of the universe in > > one day.
