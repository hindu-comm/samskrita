I viewed the youtube clip cited above. That leads me to the following query:

  

There is a picture of Adi Shankara in it. That picture is so familiar to us that we would instantly recognize the person in it as Adi Shankara. The same happens with similar other pictures of historical personages such as Sant Jnaneshwar, Tukaram, Ekanath, Tulasidas etc. We know that these are not actual portraits because, I believe, in the middle ages in India there was no tradition of portraiture of prominent persons . The portraits that we see, like that of Shivaji, were actual portraits drawn by some foreign artist who happened to be travelling in India at time. (In the case of Shivaji, a Dutch artist, who happened to be in Surat on the occasion of the first attack on Surat by Shivaji, drew his likeness. Mughals had their own court painters.)

  

The other familiar faces must have been created by someone using his imagination around the time when the printing press and the art of printing took roots in India. I am curious to know the antecedents of these pictures. Is there any such study available?
