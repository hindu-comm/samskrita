Bhajare Loka Gurum - a kriti on Bhagavatpada Adi Shankaracharya composed by Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji

  

Lyrics:

  

भज रे लोकगुरुं मनुज भज रे लोकगुरुम् ॥

  

आर्यांबामुखपङ्कजभानुं आर्याजानिपदांबुजभृङ्गम् ।

नित्यानित्यविवेचनचतुरं सत्याद्वयचिच्चिन्तननिरतम् ॥

  

दण्डकमण्डलुमण्डितपाणिं पण्डितपामरवन्दितपादम् ।

शङ्करमाश्रितजनमन्दारं किङ्करभारतीतीर्थसुसेव्यम् ॥

  

bhaja rē lōkaguruṁ manuja bhaja rē lōkagurum॥

  

āryāṁbāmukhapaṅkajabhānuṁ āryājānipadāṁbujabhr̥ṅgam ।

nityānityavivēcanacaturaṁ satyādvayaciccintananiratam ॥

  

daṇḍakamaṇḍalumaṇḍitapāṇiṁ paṇḍitapāmaravanditapādam ।

śaṅkaramāśritajanamandāraṁ kiṅkarabhāratītīrthasusēvyam ॥

  

Translation:

  

O mortals! Pray to the universal preceptor who was the Sun that brought cheer to the lotus-like face of Aryambal and the black bee lured to the lotus feet of Ishwara, who with shrewdness distinguished the eternal from the ephemeral and who was immersed in contemplation on truth, non-dualism and Brahman.

  

Meditate on Acharya Sri Shankara whose hand holds a staff and a pitcher, with scholars and common folk alike prostrating at His feet. Worship the Guru who protects like the Kalpavriksha those who seek refuge in Him and who is well adored by Acharya Sri Bharati Tirtha.
