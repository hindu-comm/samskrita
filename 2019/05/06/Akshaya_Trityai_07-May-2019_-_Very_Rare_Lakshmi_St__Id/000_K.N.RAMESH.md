Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Akshaya Trityai** falls on **Tuesday (07-May-2019)**, I am delighted to share a very rare hymn on **Goddess Lakshmi by Lord Narayana** taken from **Bhargava Upa Puranam, Uttara Khanda and Chapter 20**. Akshaya Trityai day also happens to be **Lord Balarama Jayanti**. I had already shared the just of handful of stutis available on **Lord Balarama** form in the past.

  

In today's context, people queue in jewelry shops on Akshaya Trityai day to buy gold falling for the clever marketing strategies of the jewelers. Though there is nothing wrong in buying gold, the shastras have no such prescription. Shastras only prescribe performing dharmic activities that are of help to others, worship to favorite deity forms and more importantly ancestral worship (**Pitru Tarpan**). Ignoring these and purchase of only gold will be of little consequence.

  

May We Pray To Goddes Lakshmi on Akshaya Trityai day with this beautiful hymn and an earnest prayer to Her to shower our lives with abundance in every dharmic aspect of our lives.

  

With best regards & Pranams,
