Thank you Bhat sir for your reply, which led me to check the details.  

I found that the translator used a commentary of Baladeva Vidyabhusana:

<https://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/dedication>

And Baladeva's comment about hinasti is: na hinasti nAdhaH pAtayati.

<https://archive.org/details/GitaBhusana3.KrsnadasBaba/page/n11>

  

To Valerio ji,

If there is some weird translation of a word, then the answer might be in the commentary. No notable translator would take a risk. Now, for to check why Baladeva has used hinasti in that way, we have to check what previous school/teaching/book he referred; and that would be help in further understanding.  

  

Thanks.
