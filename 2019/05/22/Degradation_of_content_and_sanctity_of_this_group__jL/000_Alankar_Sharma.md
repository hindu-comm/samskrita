Respected Sirs,

  

For the last few months, I feet the content and quality of this group is degraded and it has become like a Whatsapp group, where people would post anything and everything in the name of Sanskrit. Someone is posting stories, Subhashit, links to sites and I can't figure out why? This, to the best of my knowledge, was a scholarly Google group, where I would read scholarly answers/ ask queries from *vidwajjan.*  
  
Please let it be like a group it was made for I request all of you.

  

Thanks,

Alankar Sharma
