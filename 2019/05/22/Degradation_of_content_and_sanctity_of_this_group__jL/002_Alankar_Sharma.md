Respected Bhat ji,

  

This is kind of "Shutup" message for me. Still, I'll be here to get "पंकज पंक मध्ये"

  

My intent was not to "Blame" the group but to get moderation on some posts which tell Pangram in Hindi, which is actually not but still do copy-paste for whatever reasons.  
  
I'll be a mute spectator, pardon me If I hurt you.

  

Thanks,

Alankar
