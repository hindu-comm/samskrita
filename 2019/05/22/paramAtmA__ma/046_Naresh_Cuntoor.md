No. What I was doing is known in everyday parlance as "calling spade a spade".

I'll answer that question after you answer whether we should give credence to Panini and his long lineage of grammarians or your own understanding of MacDonnell / Mueller.  

  

Incidentally, I pointed out in the specific instance of kim + atra Mueller actually \*disagrees\* with your characterization. So I don't know why you are invoking his name in this context.  

As far as MacDonnell, I have not seen the book. So I cannot comment. If he conflates sandhi and samhitaa, then that is an improper characterization of Paninian grammar and his book would have an error. So there you go - I have answered your question already.
