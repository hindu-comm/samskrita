Denying the obvious and making ad hominem attacks while doing so seems to be the modus operandi here.

vyanjan Sandhi

  

gramam atati = gramamatati

  

in other cases the ending consonant of the first word would change when Sandhi takes place.  

  

Two words CANNOT become one without Sandhi.

  

In some cases, Samasa is also happening when two or more words become one.

  

But without Sandhi Samasa cannot happen.
