Max Muller is not an authority for Sanskrit grammar, but Panini. Where Panini has distinguished external and internal Sandhi-s? It is explained for the conenience of westerners who use English letters and nothing more than that. Did Siddhanta Kaumudi give an example of Sandhi in kim+atra? Is there any rule for Sandhi said by Panini?
