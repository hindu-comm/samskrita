What is the problem with compound with parama×aatmaa?

  

**परमात्मा**, \[न्\] पुं, (परमः केवलः आत्मा ।)  

  

which is attested in Sanskrit Dictionaries like Shabdakalpadruma above which is authoritiy for us. Here is entry in Vacaspatya:

  

**परमात्मन्**पु० कर्म० ।

परमेश्वरे “स्वर्गापवर्गयोर्मार्गमामनन्ति मनीषिणः । यदपास्तिमसावत्र परमात्मा निरूप्यते” कुसुमा० । “परमात्मा परं ब्रह्म निर्गुणं प्रकृतेःपरः ।कारणं कारणानाञ्च श्रीकृष्णो भगवान् खयम्”ब्रह्मवे० पु० प्रकृति० २३ अ० गोता १५ अ० ।

also explains as karmadharaya compound. Any problem with this explanation?

  

I have no objection if you can find it as you explained in any Sanskrit Commentaries in two words. Only because you are splitting into two words, you are taking param as indeclinable. I do not see any other reason to take itindeclinable. I had asked to consider Monier William for usages of param asindeclinable.

  

Here are the entry in Vacaspatya for param asindeclinable:

  

**परम्**अव्य० पृ--अमि । १ नियोगे २ क्षेपे ३ केबले च मेदि० । ४ पश्चादर्थे च ।  

  

I have no argument. Consider any of the meaning given above is suitable for the context of twords and decide yourself. Mr. Naresh Countour had given his opinion supporting single compound word.
