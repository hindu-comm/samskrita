This group would probably accept Sandhi is taking place in  

  

Samyak uktam = samyaguktam "well said"



Parivrat ayam = parivradayam "he (is) a mendicant"



Sarit atra = saridatra "the river here"

  

But heaven forbid, there cannot be Sandhi in

  

Kim atra = kimatra "what (is) here?"

  

(All examples taken from Sanskrit grammar for students by A A McDonell).

  

I don't blame them - there is near universal conflation of "Sandhi" and "Sound change due to Sandhi"
