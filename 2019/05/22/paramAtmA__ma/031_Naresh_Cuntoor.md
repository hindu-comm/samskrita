Even Max Mueller doesn't claim that there is a sandhi going on! Do we need a lesson in English comprehension next?

  

As the copy/pasted extract from page 26 says, "...(m+ a = ma) remains unchanged ..." - i.e., no sandhi.  

Beginner texts generally don't introduce the concept of samhitaa. That does not mean that Samskrit grammar does not distinguish between sandhi and samhitaa.  

  

Also I see that you have not answered what "sandhi without sound change" is or what fictitious sandhi is going on with raama-kathaa and so on.

  

So, Mr. skflexp1, re: "...drop this..." - if you post incorrect information, I'm afraid that I won't simply drop it without pointing out glaring errors.
