Sandhi as a situation is different from Sandhi as a process. Sometimes the word Sandhi is used in the sense of Samhitaa which is a situation. It is the situation of the last phoneme of a word being pronounced with utmost closeness to the first phoneme of another word. These two words need not necessarily for one single word or phrase or any such expression. kim+ atra is an example for two words having samhitaa at their meeting point without a phonemic change. There is a situation called samhitaa here. If the word Sandhi is used in reference to such a situation, then only there is Sandhi here.

  

But the word Sandhi is well settled with the connotation of phonemic change that takes place in the situation called Samhitaa.

  

The word Sandhi as part of the various names of Sandhis such as SavarNadeerghasandhi, guNasandhi etc. refers to such a phonemic change only.

  

In kim+atra, there is no such change. Hence in the well settled
connotation of phonemic change, there is no Sandhi here.
