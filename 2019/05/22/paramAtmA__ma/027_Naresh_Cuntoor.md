The website is wrong.  

It is just a samhitaa as explained in my earlier email. That is the Paninian position whatever be [mycoaching.in](http://mycoaching.in)'s assertion.  

Even the relevant sutra was mentioned earlier. Instead of trying to understand the sutra, you have quoted some random website.

  

This is exactly why I observed that your posts don't show a sincere question. Discussions are generally more productive if answers are sought with an open mind, without assuming infallibility on one's part.

This is wrong - on two counts.  

Example, देवानां राजा देवराजः - two words become one word.  

Please tell me what sandhi is taking place in देव + राज.  

  

Secondly, after sandhi, two words do not become one word. They remain two independent words. The change is limited to pronunciation.  

  

  

For sure, two (or more) words become one word in a samaasa.  

अनेकस्य पदस्य एकपदीभवनं समास:। (महाबलेश्वरभट्टा:, समासः इति पुस्तकम् - recommended reading)

Wrong again. See example above. A samaasa did indeed happen without sandhi.
