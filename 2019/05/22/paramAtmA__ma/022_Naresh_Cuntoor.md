Given the tone of your question, it seems that your mind is made up.

  

But I hope that other beginners will find this reply informative.

  

As the copy-pasted extract from the avg site says, sandhi is a morphological transformation. What morphological change do you see in परम् + आत्मा = परमात्मा ?

Put differently, if you see a sandhi in परम् + आत्मा = परमात्मा, then you should see at least two sandhis in र्+आ+म्+अ = राम .  

  

Another example -  

Whether I write "पाहि राम", " प् आ ह् इ र् आ म् अ", the pronunciation does not change. I recall hearing that the Tamil script has the latter form (I could be mistaken about this though).  

Equally, I could write the sentence as "paahi raama" or "p aa h i r aa m a", without changing the way it is pronounced. No sandhi in this example. Similarly, no sandhi in परम् आत्मा परमात्मा.  

  

(We have already discussed the unsoundness of the compound परम् आत्मा
परमात्मा, so I won't repeat it).

  

  

As an aside, when the two words are परम and आत्मा , there is a clear sound change in the resulting word (परमात्मा) which is a well-known sandhi.
