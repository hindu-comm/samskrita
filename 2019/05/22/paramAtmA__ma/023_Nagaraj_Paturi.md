\> I recall hearing that the Tamil script has the latter form (I could be mistaken about this though).

  

-- Probably you heard about clusters (samyukta aksharas) being written using separate symbols for the different consonants making the cluster.

  

For example,

  

ப ர மா த்ம ப = pa; ர = ra; ம = ma ; மா = maa ; த் = t ; ம = ma . A dot on the body of the script makes it halanta form. For example, ப் = p while ப = pa

ர் = r while ர = ra ம் = m while ம = ma மா = maa த் = t

  

Why Telugu Kannada people and even Malayalam people to some extent talk about the peculiarity of Tamil script is in the scripts of these three languages, like in the Devanagari script consonant contributors to a cluster (samyukta akshara) are written using 'half symbols' making part of the script symbol of the whole cluster. i.e., One cluster has one symbol in these languages while one cluster is written using different script symbols in Tamil. త్మ in Telugu; ತ್ಮ in Kannada; त्म in Devanagari; த்ம in Tamil. But Tamil does not have two separate symbols written for the consonant and vowel parts of a syllable. i.e., க = ka; it is not written as க் அ ;

  

English script is the best example for what you have in mind. Consonant and vowel parts of a syllable are separately written in that script as we all know. That is why for phonetic writing internationally that English script also called as Roman script is used with suitable modifications using diacritical marks.

That apart, your point that there is no sandhi in p+ a, r+a, m+aa; t+ m+ a etc. is valid. In the same vein, m + aa = maa in param+ aatma is also not a sandhi, i.e., not a morphophonemic change since there is no change taking place here.

  

There is samhitaa between the end phoneme of the first word and the beginning phoneme of the second word. But no sandhi change at the samhitaa =juncture.
