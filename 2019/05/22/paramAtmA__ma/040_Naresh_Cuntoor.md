Is this in response to raama + kathaa = raamakathaa ?  

Please provide a source for this claim instead of simply asserting that it "is only rarely understood".  

  

As Sri Nagaraj and others have explained, प्रकृतिभावसन्धि is a well-understood concept. It does not apply in the case of kim + atra or raama + kathaa. If you believe that not to be the case, please cite the relevant sutra (or at least an authoritative source).  

  

As Sri Bhat noted, Max Mueller's book has several problems - but for the purpose of this discussion, I am fine with ignoring those problems for now.  

Incidentally, M.R. Kale's higher grammar book is more comprehensive.
