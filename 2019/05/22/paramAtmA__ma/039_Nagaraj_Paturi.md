प्रकृतिभावसंधि is not the same as kim+atra kind. Or, kim+atra = kimatra is not प्रकृतिभावसंधि.

  

फले + अवपतत = फले अवपतत is an example of प्रकृतिभावसंधि.

  

This is a case of no change being a kind of change, whereas kim+atra = kimatrais a case just of no change.

  

प्रकृतिभावसंधि. is a case of no change being a kind of change because in all other similar situations of sannikarshaa between two vowels, there is a phonemic change; here, in spite of a sannikarshaa between two vowels at the word joining junction, there is no phonemic change.

  

'No sandhi' is also a grammaticographical concept. When a sandhi (or any other kaarya ) is instructed as vaikalpika, the case of occurrence of sandhi and the case of occurrence of no sandhi are being instructed as the two possible 'results' of sannikarshaa. So no sandhi in sannikarshaa is a valid grammaticographical concept. Essence of no sandhi is no phonemic change. Hence sandhi is phonemic change is proved.
