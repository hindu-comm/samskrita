you seem to be confusing "Sandhi" with 'Sandhi with Sound-change"

  

Sandhi applies whenever two sounds come together

  

Samasa creates a new word by simply putting together the stem forms of the words - after this first step the compound may offer new opportunities for Sandhi:

  

Ramasya Upakhyana \>(Samasa) rama upakyana \>(sandhi) ramopakhyana

  

Ramasya katha \>(Samasa) rama katha \> (Sandhi) ramakatha

  

still has Sandhi , except that the two sounds just joined without changing either.
