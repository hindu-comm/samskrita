Thanks to Sri Nagaraj for the clarification.

It is the same concept in both the cases. The relevant sutra is परस्सन्निकर्षः संहिता as noted.  

Commentators give परः = अतिशयितः as in वर्णानाम् अतिशयितः सामीप्यम् संहिता .  

  

This कारिका provides more clarification -  

संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः ।

नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥  

  

To your question, संहितैकपदे नित्या provides the answer in that in a single word, e.g., रामः, there is no room for introducing pauses as in र् आ म् अः because संहिता is नित्या.

संहिता is a prerequisite for सन्धिः.

In other words, where there is सन्धिः, there is always संहिता.  

Where there is संहिता, there need not be सन्धिः.
