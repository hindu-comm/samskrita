Please provide the samskrit terminology for "sandhi with sound-change".

According to which grammar? Please specify.  

Please provide a primary (or at least, authoritative) source for this claim.

If you believe that there is a sandhi in राम + कथा -> रामकथा, please identify the type of sandhi and relevant sutra.

  

For example, मधु + अरिः = मध्वरिः - यण् ; इको यणचि

  

Also, please clarify if you think two words become one after a sandhi.

For example, in the familiar shloka श्रीराम राम रामेति … are two words becoming one word in रामेति?
