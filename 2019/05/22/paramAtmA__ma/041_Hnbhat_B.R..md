A small note on प्रकृतिभावः। It is a case where there is possible phonemic change between the two vowels in all the examples as in other examples of Sandhi between vowels and avowels and consonants. And in all the caaes, फले अवपततः it was possible to have sandhi without the rule forप्रकृतिभावः is ordained byप्लुतप्रगृह्या अचि नित्यम् which happens to be here ईदूदेद्द्विवचनं प्रगृह्यम् the vowel ए in the preceding word as required by the rule to beप्रगृह्यम्l For example फले+अत्र it is not the case forप्रगृह्यम् as it is सप्तमी and it will take here पूर्वरूप due toएङः पदान्तादति and becomesफलेऽत्र। It would have become changed as here in the earlier case unless it has been under the perview of the rule ofप्रगृह्यम्. This is the difference between kim+atra and prakritibhava. There is no rule mentioned for sandhi between a consonant and another vowel as in kim atra by Panini or a vowel and consonant as inraama+ kathaa.Only Max Muler says there is sandhi and our SK following him. In the second case, the compound is between रामस्य कथा and not between raama and kathaa according to compound rule.

  

This is my understanding.
