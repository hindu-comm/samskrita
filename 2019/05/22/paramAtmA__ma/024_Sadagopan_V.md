Sir,

  

A genuine doubt.

  

Should there be not some differentiation between "Raama" where all four letters in the word are necessarily pronounced without a gap and whereas there could be a choice to pronounce "param" +"aatmaa" with a small gap between the two words.

  

Is it a settled siddhanta that param+aatmaa cannot be called a sandhi (because परस्सन्निकर्षः संहिता may not have prasakti here?)
