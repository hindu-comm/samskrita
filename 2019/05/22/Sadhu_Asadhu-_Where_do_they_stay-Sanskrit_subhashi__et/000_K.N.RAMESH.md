Iॐ श्रीगुरुभ्यो नमः।  
I वन्दे संस्कृतमातरम् I

श्लोकस्तु श्लोकतां याति यत्र तिष्ठन्ति साधवाः l  
लकारो लुप्यते तत्र यत्र तिष्ठन्त्यसाधवाः ll

The Subhashitakar is playing with words here when he says –  
In an assembly of righteous, noble and knowledgeable people,  
recitation of shlokas (verses or hymns in Sanskrit literature)  
are appreciated and enjoyed by all.  
But in an assembly thronged by wicked and mean people  
the effect is just the opposite – i.e. sorrow. The Subhashitakar says here that this is due to dropping of the alphabet la from the word shloka making it shoka – which means sorrow due to unruly behaviour of the wicked people who do not appreciate finer points of poetry.
