Conduct while in the abode of Vishnu..

मुधा संभाषते यस्तु प्रविश्य देवमन्दिरम्।  
स निधिः पुरतः सिद्धं त्यक्त्वा भिक्षति काकिणीम्॥  
यस्तु संभाषते व्यर्थे देवालयमुपाश्रितः।  
सिद्धमन्नं परित्यज्य भिक्षामटति दुर्मतिः॥  
यन्मुहूर्तं क्षणं वापि परमात्मा न चिन्त्यते।  
सा हानिस्तन्महच्छिद्रम् सा भ्रान्तिः सा तु विक्रिया॥  
सन्त्यनेके प्रदेशाश्च समयाश्च विशेषतः।  
लोकयात्राविनिष्पत्त्यै देहयात्रोपयोगिनः।  
तस्माद्देवगृहं गत्वा नरो नाऽन्यपरो भवेत्॥  
न हि देवस्य पुरतः क्वचिदप्यनृतं वदेत्।  
सत्यस्वरूपी भगवान् सत्यं तस्मै न गूहयेत्॥  
न हि देवगृहं गत्वा शास्त्रर्थैनीरसैर्नरः।  
मुहूर्तं क्षपयेत् कालं तद्देवस्य विमानना।  
पाठनं लेखनाद्यं च नैवे कुर्यात् गृहे हरेः।  
स भवेदक्षरद्रोही यस्तु कुर्याद् व्यतिक्रमम्॥  
अनिबद्धप्रलापान् ये कुर्वन्ते देवमन्दिरे।  
तेऽपि तित्तिरितां भूत्वा जायन्ते जन्मपञ्चकम्॥  
न हि देवगृहं गत्वा विवदेत नरः क्वचित्।  
न तत् स्थानं विवादस्य तस्मात्तं दूरतस्त्यजेत्॥

te'pi tittiritāṁ bhūtvā jāyante janmapañcakam\|\|  
na hi devagṛhaṁ gatvā vivadeta naraḥ kvacit\|  
na tat sthānaṁ vivādasya tasmāttaṁ dūratastyajet\|\|

One who enters the temple of Hari and indulges in loose talk and gossip is, in fact, losing great wealth readily available with him and in fact tends to go along begging for the alms and dirt meant for crows..

One who is talking of wasteful things while inside the house of god, is actually in a condition where he is ignoring to enjoy a delicious meal of rice and is going around begging for alms

(The first two slokas above indicate that if we indulge in loose talk while in temple, we would be led to utter poverty.. Also, when it is time to praise the glories of the Lord Narayana, why should we engage in loose talk?)

Every moment in life, every split second, especially when in a temple, if it is not spent in contemplation of Lord Narayana, that moment indicates total destruction, that moment is the source of mental turmoil and schism, that moment means madness, that moment means misconduct..

There are too many opportunities and periods of time where people can do things which are of day to day worldly affairs, which could be spent for the comforts of the body and its pleasure... but the abode of Vishnu is not for that purpose.. One should not think of worldly pleasures and personal achievements while in the temple, but should concentrate on the glory and the service of Lord Narayana.

Lord Narayana is the embodiment of Truth.. Therefore, no words that imply untruth directly or by implication should be uttered in His divine presence.. An no truth should be concealed from the Lord.

Not even for a moment, one visiting the Lords abode, should talk disparagingly about the Shastras, Scriptures and divine lore.  
Even a little of time spent is such criticism would amount to contempt and disrespect being heaped on the Lord. One should not read of write such blasphemous material in the precincts of the Lord. If someone discredit Shastras in words, or deeds as described here, he becomes an enemy and destroyer of words and knowledge and incurs divine anger.

One who makes incoherent and meaningless prattle while present in the temple, he would be cursed to become the chatterbox tittiri bird.. for five future lives.

While visiting the abode of Narayana, one should not engage in acrimonious debate or discussion on any subject.. The Gods abode is not for debate and discussion, but just for His worship.

The directions given in the above slokas come from Bhrigu Rishis treatise.. about worship of the Lord

Sure, these instructions would apply to all.. in all Hindu temples and perhaps even in the abodes of God found in any other religion too.
