Namaste, in yoga darshana, we have samprajnata and asamprajnata samadhis.

  

I would like to know whether samprajnata somehow comes from something like,

Sa + prajna + vibhakti ending

  

My guess was samadhi with seed where seed is prajna (discriminative knowledge) of the chosen object for samayama.

  

Please tell me what's right.

Thanks,

Vishal
