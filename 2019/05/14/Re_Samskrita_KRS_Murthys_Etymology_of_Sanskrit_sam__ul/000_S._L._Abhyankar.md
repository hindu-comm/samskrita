By his mention of single syllable aspect, I get to think that there have been ‡§è‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂-s

His research may throw some light on that.

Many of his contentions however are open to argument. He is of course not correct in saying that all prefixes and suffixes are of single syllable. The ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø ‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç for example cannot be called to be of single syllable. Nor the prefixes ‡§â‡§™‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó-s ‡§Ö‡§™, ‡§Ö‡§µ ‡§â‡§™ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§øcan be called to be of single syllable.

If his elementary knowledge of Sanskrit has too many confusions, then his post does not merit discussion.

Shall we seek opinion of other august members of the group, before deleting the thread entirely ?

But his basic intention seems to be to explore structural concepts embedded in the structuring of words and his thought seems to be, to explore applying IT tools for the structural analysis.

Isn't there is some merit in that basic intention ?
