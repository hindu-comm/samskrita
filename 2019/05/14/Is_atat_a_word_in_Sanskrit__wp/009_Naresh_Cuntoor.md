Seen in the context of the shlokas, the translations of atat don't seem egregious or fanciful. At least in one instance, the word atat appearing in a repeated shloka is translated differently - as extraneous in one case and godless in the other. Seen in the context of shlokas, one could make a case for either. I don't see anything totally fanciful in these examples.
