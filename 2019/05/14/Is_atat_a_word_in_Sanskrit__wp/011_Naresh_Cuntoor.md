Translations have inherent limitations and biases. While critiquing translations however, I see no purpose being served without stating a few disclaimers upfront. In this instance, you have sought to distinguish between so-called sectarian and non sectarian translations. The use of the word sectarian itself reveals a biased view. Someone in the bhaktivedanta tradition say, can criticise an advaitavedanta tradition as sectarian after all.

  

If you have a problem with this particular tradition, perhaps you should discuss it with adherents of that school if you are interested in an honest enquiry. Instead, what we see is another attempt at putting the cart before the horse. Your earlier post declared the translation to be fanciful, and now you have deemed it frivolous. Let us consider the rigorous analysis provided to arrive at this characterization.

  

The previous email quoted seven examples without any attempt at discussing the perceived problems in translation. Subsequently, you have quoted Humpty Dumpty and Alice, copy/pasted two translations for one shloka. With this extensive analysis, you have passed judgement on the tradition, and characterized the translations as fanciful and frivolous.

  

Based on previous threads, I suspect you will now take offense and complain. And remain silent regarding the questions raised. (I am still waiting for your clarification regarding the sandhi rule in the other thread).
