Namaste!

  

Is there any Sanskrit word (or any related word) that means “Free to attack at will until death" or "Continue to fight until death" ?  
  
The closet word I found is Saṃśaptaka (संशप्तक) which means a warrior sworn never to recede from a contest and kept to prevent the fight of others. However, it has a different meaning than what I am looking for.

  

Thanks,

Saurabh
