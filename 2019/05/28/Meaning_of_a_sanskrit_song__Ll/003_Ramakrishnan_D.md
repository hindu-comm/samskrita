Here goes the meaning of the song as I understand with my limited knowledge in Samskritam.( Line by line).

  

Samskritam to be protected.

------------------------------------

We are ready for protection of Smskritam

Indian culture flourishes by Samskritam.

    By praising Samskritam nothing is achieved

    By talking in Samskritam make it permanently achieved.

    Language of general public is their life

    That becomes famous through out the country.

To serve Samskritam is to serve our mother

To talk in Samskritam is service to Goddess Saraswati.

Mother-tongue is great to respect our mothers

Talking in simple Samskritam makes children happy.

     It had its glory when kings and emperors ruled

     Now democratic rule alone exists (without it glory)

     Therefore mentors and teachers sacrifice their might

     In bringing the past glory of Samsktam to the people.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Hope Sriram, I have put its meaning in my own words.

You may search out Smskrita Bharati offices in all big cities in India.

Since you wanted its meaning, I have given it to the extent I understood.

Regards.
