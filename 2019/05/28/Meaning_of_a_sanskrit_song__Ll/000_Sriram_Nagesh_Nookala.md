Hello All,

  

I am looking for the meaning of the attached Sanskrit song. Please let me know where can I find it. (or if any one can give it too , will be thankful).

  

I have recently joined this group, please let me know if this has already been discussed or if I need to know any other details for such postings.

  

Dhanyavadaha,  
Nagesh
