Dear list members,  
  
I'm trying to collect works that discuss Sanskrit writing style and  
what constitutes beautiful/preferable style vs awkward writing. A  
couple of such works were mentioned in a thread here a few years ago,  
but I couldn't find the thread (maybe it's too old).  
All your suggestions, be they on prose or verse, ancient or modern  
style, would be sincerely appreciated. By the way, they don't have to  
be full treatises, they could be a chapter or two in a book on another  
topic, for example.  
  
Irene
