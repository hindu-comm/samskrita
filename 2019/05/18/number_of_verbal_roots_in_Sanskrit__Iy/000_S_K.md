Dhatupatha claims there are around 2000 verbal roots in Sanskrit - but in reality only around half are actually attested in Sanskrit works.

  

Whitney the American Sanskritist was quite skeptical about the 2000 verbal roots claimed by Indian grammarians.

  

Some folks discovered unattested roots in Sanskrit attested in Prakrits.

  

Do we have a final count of how many attested (including Prakrits) verbal roots exist in Sanskrit?
