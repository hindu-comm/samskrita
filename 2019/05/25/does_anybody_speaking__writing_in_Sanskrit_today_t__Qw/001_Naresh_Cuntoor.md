When I write in English, I think in English. When I write in samskrit, I think in samskrit. Neither is my native language.

  

I don't think literal translations of phrases are helpful. But I have come to realize that it takes time to learn idiomatic usages in any language.

  

(Moderator hat on) This is a Sanskrit group where posts in the language (not about) are encouraged. Let us treat the question raised by SK as an opportunity to remind ourselves of this purpose without getting into a long discussion about this.

  

  

  

Thanks,

Naresh
