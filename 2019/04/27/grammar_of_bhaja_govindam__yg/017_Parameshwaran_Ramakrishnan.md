Hello All

Hope my replies to this group is accepted - they have bounced back on me in the past.

This is how I would answer this gentleman/lady "SK":

Dear SK, to interpret scriptural texts we need more than the grammatical-linguistic skills. We need to have the skills of "ritualistic sacrifices" that are mentioned in the *karma kanda*. Even as I say this, I have been very cryptic. Not many Sanskritists would know it either.

-   I can see that you have enough knowledge of Sanskrit grammar to
    parse the verse/s for deeper understanding. But, you have to become
    aware that what you are doing is intellectual. That is okay too.
    But, we need to know that there is an intellect which is higher than
    the cognitive-intellect (or intellect that comes from cognitive
    processing).
-   Now you have to look for the next level of skill (1) what does
    *karma kanda* say? How is it related with *jnana kanda*? (2) why do
    we need both those *kandas*or do we? and, finally (3) what is the
    definition of sutra texts? In what way a shloka text (or for that
    matter all works related to theology) resemble a sutra text? -   Before going further, to gently challenge you. Please try and
    understand why and how Humility is given such an importance in Hindu
    gurukula system of education. Know that "*There is no Guru out there
    in the outer world who can teach us but only when we let that other
    person become our Guru.*"

Best Wishes

Krish
