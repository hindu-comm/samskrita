I haven’t looked at archives thoroughly but it would be good to know who “SK” is - at least full name. The posts seem nearer to anonymous posts, and maybe that’s allowed in this forum because content is all that matters. 

  

Some people post with their entire background in signature and it helps to put context around their posts. Others have their full name or at least first name or an email id that shows from a simple google search who the person is. This doesn’t seem to the case with SK’s email id either.

  

So far some posts from SK that I’ve read aims to criticize Shankaracharya’s Sanskrit, Panini’s Sanskrit, and Valmiki’s writing as traditionally understood. It would help to know the background of SK before taking these criticism seriously imo. He or She certainly seems to have far more Sanskrit knowledge than me but there are others who don’t think that’s much - should I read these posts or take a pass?
Can’t answer this without the above info.

  

Sincerely,

Sanjivendra
