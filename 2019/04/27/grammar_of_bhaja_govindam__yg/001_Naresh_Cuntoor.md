Here's some unsolicited advice - statements like these betray your ignorance and unfamiliarity with Samskrit. If you are genuinely interested in learning, perhaps you could think twice before calling something a blunder, and an outright one at that.  

  

As to your question, please do an anvaya for this shloka and we can then decide on whether this shloka has a blunder or not.
