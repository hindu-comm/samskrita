OK - it becomes grammatical (with very loose word order ) if it is interpreted as a quotation from Dhatupatha  

  

``` kRRi | ta0 aniT u0 | DukRRi॒~n kara॑Ne 8.10 ||

Panini himself seems to have used the peculiar locative case for the meanings of Dhatus.

The whole thing is a bit jarring, even if grammatical.
