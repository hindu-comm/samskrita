Whats there to analyze?

  

It is pretty elementary Sanskrit.

  

"It doesn't save on repeating ( the grammatical rule of) dukrnj"

  

This seems totally wrong.

  

you could say "you won't be saved by uttering grammatical rules"

  

or "uttering grammatical rules won't save you"

  

or "on uttering grammatical rules, you won't be saved"
