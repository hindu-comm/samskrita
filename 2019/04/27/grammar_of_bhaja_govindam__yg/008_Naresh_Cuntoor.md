To a student of Samskrit, this is about as jarring as being told that the sentence "Rama killed Ravana" makes sense if Rama is interpreted as the subject of the sentence.

  

When one doesn't realize or more correctly, refuses to recognize one's blindspot, Bhartrhari, however harsh, is on the money.  

  

अथवा एवं स्यात् -  

गाम्भीर्याभ इभो मुदा नु कुरुते धूल्या वपुर्मण्डनं

भूलोकोद्धरसूकरस्स सततं पङ्के विनोदोत्सवम् ।

सेतुप्रस्तरपूतहस्तकुलजो विष्ठाकृतं कङ्कणं  

दोषो हस्तिवराहमर्कटगतो ? नैव स्वभावोदितः ॥
