जालगोलक are the round weights attached to the fishermen's nets to make the nets submerge under the water. The black ripe jambu fruits make the fish think that that they are weights attached to the fishing nets and that is the reason they keep away from them.

  

The text calledभोजनकुतूहल, written towards the end of the 17th century by Raghunath, who was in the court of Ekoji Bhosale of Tanjavur, gives the following description of this fruit:

  

जम्बू: कषायमधुरा श्रमपित्तदाह-

कण्ठार्तिदोषशमनी कृमिदोषहन्त्री ।

श्वासातिसारकफकासविनाशिनी च

विष्टम्भदा त्वपि च रोचनपाचनी च ॥
