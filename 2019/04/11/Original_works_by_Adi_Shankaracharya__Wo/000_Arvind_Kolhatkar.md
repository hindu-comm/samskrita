Dear Group,

  

A query sent by our colleague in this group, Harry Spier, in the Indology List<http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2018-August/142834.html>was seen by me. I wish to inform him through this mail that the late Prof. KS Arjunwadkar had addressed the very same topic in his article "PANEGYRICS ON ÅšIVA GROUP ASCRIBED TO SHANKARA:- A CRITIAL STUDY" published in Vol 85 of the BORI journal. The article is available as a pdf at<http://www.jstor.org/stable/41691944>.

  

The late Dr SK Belvalkar had discussed the issue of authorship of several works traditionally attributed to Adi Shankaracharya in his "Shree Gopal Basu Mallik Lectures on Vedanta Philosophy" delivered in 1925. These lectures are available at<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553438/page/n1>.
Lecture No 4 is devoted, among other topics, to that of the authorship of several works traditionally attributed to Adi Shankaracharya.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar
