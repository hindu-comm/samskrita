Ken,

Curiosity to know the correct pronunciation is valid, but why make such effort, without any such rules people have done ton of disservice by creating typo laded Sanskrit text everywhere. I can't imagine people remembering standardized tools etc and will introduce more errors.  

Irony is people with Pen & paper had less typos then all computers.  

Thats my 2 cents.
