Nityanandaji,

  

Let us, for a moment, keep aside whatever prompted Prof Goldman to introduce the word 'lowly' in his translation, for which you accuse him of 'othering' the Shudras. But has Valmiki himself not done this 'othering' when he appendsअपि to Shudras as inशूद्रोऽपि? Valmiki's text allows the several benefits of reading of Ramayana to the three upper castes as a 'given', after which he condescends to allow the benefit of achieving greatness to Shudras by addingअपि to them.

  

I feel that the unequal status of the Shudras, and in a similar vein, objectifying women as sex-objects is very much an ingrained fact of our beloved Sanskrit literature. I do not subscribe to those lines of thought but I can accept them as something that happened in times when people did not think as I do now. I do not boil over with indignation if this obviousfact is again brought to my notice.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
