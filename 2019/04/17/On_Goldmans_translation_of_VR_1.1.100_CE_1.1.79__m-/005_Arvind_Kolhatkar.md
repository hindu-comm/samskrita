The Valmiki verse under discussion, underscores the Shudra's lower status in another, more subtle, way.

  

The three upper castes have something to aspire for in their lives and greater achievements in their ordained fields have been promised to them in the verse. Thus, the Brahmin will become more learned (वागृषभत्व), the Kshatriya will acquire more land (भूमिपतित्व), the trading Viashya will achieve greater prosperity (पण्यफलत्व). The Shudra does not have anything specific to look forward to in his life, because he exists, as Ramakrishnanji states above, 'to serve the other 3 groups'. He is therefore promised a vague kind of 'greatness'!
