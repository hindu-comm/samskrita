It is very necessary to point out the misrepresentations of our scriptures by translators especially foreigners whose books are read all over the world in colleges & universities. If our learned people don't point out such misrepresentations of sacred scriptures, that will be equal to accepting their translations as corrrect. I congratulate Mr.Misra.
