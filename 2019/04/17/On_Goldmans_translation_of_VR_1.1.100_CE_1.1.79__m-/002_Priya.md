Namaste Sri Nityananda-ji,

  

The word 'api' in the last pAda which you translated as 'also' seems to have been interpreted as 'even' by Prof. Goldman. That would be acceptable. But having decided to go with 'even', then there is a need to explain that phrase 'even the sudra' to the non-Indian audience for which he primarily writes. Just saying 'Even a sudra achieves greatness' perhaps does not serve to convey the meaning to a reader who may not be familiar with the term sudra. So to clearly say that even a person of humble origins can elevate himself by merely reading the Ramayana, the word lowly appears to have been added by the translator. This is subjective, and I feel, part of the challenge of translation. If you are absolutely literal in your translation, you miss out on the spirit (and also the music) of the original. If you try to convey that with additional words introduced for clarity, then you are no longer faithful to the original! To me, this appears to be an instance where the translator favored faithlessness in the interest of clarity, to show how reading the Ramayana exalts all people, on every rung of the social/ occupational/ financial/ what have you/ ... ladder. It is hard to find fault with that.

  

In general, most translators will readily agree that they could have done better because translation is, all in all, a perilous undertaking - अभ्यस्यतीव व्रतमासिधारम् !  

  

Regards,

Priya
