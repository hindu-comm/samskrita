I am sad that people don't bother to read posts before regurgitating the same old Purusha sukta shloka. No one is defending social evils or denying them. The point of Mishra's post was to question the perceived bias in Goldman's translation. Did Valmiki have your interpretation of the Purusha sukta in mind when he composed this Ramayana shloka? I don't know. If you believe that to be the case, it would be interesting to see your justification.
