With respects to Arvindji, the 4 varnas Brahmana kshatriya vaisya & sudras are created by Lord according to their guna & karma for imparting knowledge, protecting, trading & physical service. The last group of people (sudras) are to serve the other 3 above groups and earn their livelihood.अपि indicates they too may reach Him by Ramayana-paTanam

It does'nt mean 'lowly sudras'.

dhanyavAdAH.
