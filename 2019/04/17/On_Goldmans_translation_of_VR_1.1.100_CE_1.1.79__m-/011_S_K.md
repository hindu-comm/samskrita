"lowly Sudra" is perfectly correct - scripture says he was born from Purusha's feet. Even if the original does not say "lowly" the translator is perfectly free to add it.  

  

Monier Williams:

  

**(H1)शूद्र \[p= [1085](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1085-zuSkavraNa.jpg),3\] \[L=220180\]** *m.* (of doubtful derivation) a शूद्र , a man of the fourth or lowest of the four original classes or castes (whose only business accord. to Mn. i , 91, was to serve the three higher classes ; in RV. ix , 20 , 12, the शूद्र is said to have been born from the feet of पुरुष q.v. ; in Mn. i , 87 he is fabled to have sprung from the same part of the body of ब्रह्मा , and he is regarded as of higher rank than the present low and mixed castes so numerous throughout India ; केवल-श्° , a pure शूद्र) RV. &c ( IW. 212 &c )
