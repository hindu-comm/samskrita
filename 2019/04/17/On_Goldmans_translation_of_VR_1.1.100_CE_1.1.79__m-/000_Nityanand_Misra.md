Dear list members,

  

This is verse 1.1.100 from the Ramayana of Valmiki (it is verse 1.1.79 in the critical edition).

पठन् द्विजो वागृषभत्वमीयात्स्यात्क्षत्रियो भूमिपतित्वमीयात्।  
वणिग्जनः पण्यफलत्वमीयाज्जनश्च शूद्रोऽपि महत्त्वमीयात्॥

paṭhan dvijo vāgṛṣabhatvam īyāt syāt kṣatriyo bhūmipatitvam īyāt  
vaṇigjanaḥ paṇyaphalatvam īyāt janaś ca śūdro’pi mahattvam īyāt

A famous verse, this is the ‘phalashruti’ of the first ‘sarga’ of the Ramayana. Here is my translation:

“Reading \[the Ramayana\], may a brahmana obtain eloquence. If a kshatriya \[reads it\], may \[he\] obtain lordship over land. May a vaishya man \[reading it\] obtain profitability from \[saleable\] goods. And may a shudra man \[reading it\] also obtain greatness.”

Here is Prof. Robert Goldman’s translation  
“A brahman who reads it becomes eloquent, a kshatriya becomes a lord of the earth, a vaiśya acquires profit from his goods, and even a lowly śūdra achieves greatness.”

I see two basic mistakes in Goldman’s translation.

1\) The first mistake is grammatical. The verbal form used is ईयात् which means “may he/she/it go, may he/she/it obtain, may he/she/it get”, being the benedictive mood (आशीर्लिङ् लकार) of the root √इण् गतौ. Goldman translates all four occurrences of this form as “becomes, achieves, acquires”, which would have been correct if the word in the original text was एति, the present tense (लट् लकार) form of the root √इण् गतौ. This is an error which is excusable for beginners, but surprising if it comes from a professor considered an authority on Sanskrit. So many ‘phalashruti’ verses use the benedictive mood, can they be rendered in the present tense? Can a phrase like शुभं भूयात् be translated as “there is aupiciousness/prosperity” instead of “may there be aupiciousness/prosperity”? If I use the term“schoolboy error” for this mistake, perhaps a Roland Steiner or a Walter Slaje will deign to pontificate about my bad manners or evil traits (and then indulge in moral posturing by withdrawing from the discussion), but still I ask the question: is erring on the लकार not a basic error in Sanskrit translation?  

  

2\) The second mistake is rather dangerous: it is a subtle distortion of Valmiki’s verse. Valmiki uses no word which could be translated as “lowly”. Word-for-word, the last quarter reads

जनः = man, च = and, शूद्रः = shudra, अपि = also, महत्त्वम् = greatness, ईयात् = may \[he\] obtain/acquire.

Goldman translates “even a *lowly* śūdra achieves greatness” (italics mine). Valmiki simply says “a shudra man/person”, Goldman translates “a lowly śūdra”. I call this mistake dangerous because it becomes a tool in the hands of propagandists who would then claim on the basis of Goldman’s translation that this is yet another example of “othering” in the Ramayana.

I referred the Gita Press Hindi translation (which I grew up reading). It is free of both mistakes in Goldman’s translation. The Gita Press translation of पठन् द्विजो वागृषभत्वमीयात् is इसे ब्राह्मण पढ़े तो विद्वान् हो (“*may* a Brahmana reading this *become* wise”), retaining the benedictive mood (विद्वान् हो), and not इसे पढ़नेवाला ब्राह्मण विद्वान् हो जाता है (“a Brahmana reading this *becomes* wise”).

Prof.Arvind Sharma as an insightful view on why Goldman makes this mistake: he says that the tendency to accentuate the differences between the shudra and other varnas is deeply ingrained in some academics that it even affects the literal translation of a Sanskrit text (third image).  

In a previous thread, the very rational David Reigle mentioned that criticism of Goldman is akin to criticism of the *guru parampara* in which Goldman studied (I do not recall the exact words used). I would strongly disagree. Whatever gurus Goldman studied under, his translation is his own original work and not that of his gurus.

I would like to hear comments from members of the list.

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
