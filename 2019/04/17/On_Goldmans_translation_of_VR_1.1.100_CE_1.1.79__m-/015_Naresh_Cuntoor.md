Instead of posting flippant one-liners, perhaps you could read the message posted, digest it and then post your reply.  

At least, you could avoid undercutting your own argument with your reply. See this part from Sri Nagaraj's email - " अत एव पूज्यचरणपूज्यपादश्रीचरणाचार्यचरणपितृचरणेत्यादि चरणान्तं व्यवहरन्ति न तु मुखबाह्वोरन्यतमम्।"
