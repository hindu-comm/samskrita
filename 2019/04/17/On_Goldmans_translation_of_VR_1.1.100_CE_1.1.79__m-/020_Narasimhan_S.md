Fidelity to the original / author's verse is a critical responsibility of the translator. The translator can choose to add his 'modifications' / 'additions' / 'biases' in a separate footnote. Do not interpret Valmiki's words in the intentionally degraded cultural biases of today - nobody should be treated as 'lowly'.  

I fully agree with Nityanand Mishra's critical comments.
