In Hindu literature, the base case for a sudra is "lowly". The lowliness of so-called Sudras is implicit in Hindu literature, so a noble Sudra is an exception that has to be explicitly pointed out.

  

So in this verse "even if a Sudra" is talking about base case Sudras, i,e, lowly ones.

  

The Western translator felt a need to spell it out for Western readers - he has not added to or subtracted from Valmiki's intended meaning.
