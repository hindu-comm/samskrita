Isn't this the whole point (and bone of contention)?

When the translator puts something in the translation, the readerassumes that it comes from the original. The text of the translation is an unexpected place for the translator to carry out historical/sociological commentary.

  
That is, there is a difference between

1\. a translation that says “even a shudra…” and explains in a footnote / endnote / brackets that (according to the translator's interpretation/knowledge) the shudra was lowly, etc,

and

2\. a translation that says “even a lowly shudra…”, as if the original emphasized this point.

  

Now some may want to debate (1), but at any rate it seems clear that (2) is a misleading translation.  
  

(Why? Suppose for the sake of argument that Valmiki was writing in a milieu where both he and his readers took it for granted, and as a matter of fact, that the shudra had a lowly or "other" status. Then when Valmiki writes "even a shudra", it is a spirit of inclusivity relative to the prevailing situation—including even the "low"/"other"—while if he writes "a lowly shudra", it is the opposite. I do not know the history, just pointing out why it matters for the translation.)
