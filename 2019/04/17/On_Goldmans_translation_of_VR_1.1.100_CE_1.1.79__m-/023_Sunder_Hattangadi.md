Goldman is better than, some पण्डिताभासs and शुण्ठाs. Because as Nityanand Ji said, he is misinterpreting the Valmiki Ramayana. But the
our own are misinterpreting the whole culture and tradition and the living fact this I am saying because in a discussion I come across yesterday in my university.

At the same time uttamaanga(which is a synonym of head) is desired by asuraas while samudra manthana and they fought for it.  

Brahmanh dvipadaam sresrtha.

There are many instances to show Brahmin is great and others are not.
