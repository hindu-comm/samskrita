Namaste,

  

I was looking to see if there were any online resources that will allow one to learn the correct pronunciation (audio) of a Samskrita word.

  

A suggested scenario is where one can paste a word (in Samskrita devanagari script) into the tool and the tool vocalizes the word for you - allowing one to correctly learn the appropriate intonation, pitch and tone..

  

Just curious - was asked about this and I did not know of any such tools..
