Namaste,

  

Need a good & modern sanskrit term for '**consultancy services**'. The name would be decided later by directors & management. The line of services is basically the advisory services to govt. on PPP model. So, the company name would be like "**XXXX Consultancy Services'.**

  

Thx in advance.

  

rgs,

sriram
