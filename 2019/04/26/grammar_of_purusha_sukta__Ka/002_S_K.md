his mouth was the brahmin.

his two arms were made the warrior

his two thighs the vaishya

from his two feet the Sudra was born

  

Purusha was sacrificed - and these are products of the sacrifice.

  

They CAME OUT OF purusha - Brahmin and Sudra are correctly conjugated.

  

there is no verb for Vaishya (poetic license)  

  

for bahu there is a verb and it is wrong - it should have been krtau.(dual).

  

for krtah, bahubhyam (ablative) would be correct.
