Please learn some Sanskrit or try to follow or take guidance from those who know it.

  

ब्राह्मणः -- अस्य -- मुखम् --- आसीत्

  

रजन्यः -- (अस्य ) --- बाहू --- कृतः ( Word order rearranged; word order change from the 'regular' one is quite common in Sanskrit)

  

यत् ---- वैश्यः ----- (अस्ति) --- तत् ---- अस्य --- ऊरू -- (अस्ति/भवति) ( In Sanskrit, like in south Indian languages, unlike in even the present day north Indian languages or languages like English, equational sentences or verbless sentences i.e., sentences where subject and predicate both are just two nouns or noun phrases exist and existed right from the Vedas. ) (Word order rearranged here again)

  

पद्भ्यां ---- शूद्रः --- अजायत

  

पद्भ्यां can be तृतीया , चतुर्थी or पंचमी \|

  

I was proposing that it can be taken as चतुर्थी without changing the existing vibhaktis for the other three. . Poojya Jagadguru-ji was suggesting that in all the four cases , for uniformity पंचमी can be taken.
