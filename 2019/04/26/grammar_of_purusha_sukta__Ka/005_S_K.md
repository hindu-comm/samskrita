The rajanya was not made into Purusha's arms

  

the purusha's arms were made into rajanya

  

Originally only Purusha existed who was sacrificed to generate the world as we see it

  

If Sanskrit has a word for "from" that may be considered to be left out to make this sentence correct.

  

If not, it is a grammar blunder.  

  

As a side note: if you disagree, please try to disagree respectfully.
