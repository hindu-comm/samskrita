If my response sounded disrespectful, I feel sorry about it. I did not intend to be.

If you take the alternative anvaya,

  

 अस्य -- मुखम् --- ब्राह्मणः ---- आसीत् \|

  

(अस्य ) --- बाहू --- रजन्यः -- कृतः \|

  

 यत्---- अस्य --- ऊरू----- (अस्ति) --- तत् ---- वैश्यः-- आसीत् \|

  

 पद्भ्यां ---- शूद्रः --- अजायत \|

  

It is leading to the problem of agreement in the second line.
