Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. Sri Rama Navami will be celebrated on 13th/14th April 2019 and in that connection, I am delighted to share a very rare stotram on Lord Rama taken from Bhargava Upa Puranam, Uttara Khanda and Chapter 19. It looks as though the original of this purana itself had several confusing words perhaps because of illegible original manuscripts. The book provides many possible substitutes for several words.

  

Incidentally, April 14th also happens to be Tamil New Year (Solar Calendar). May I wish you all a very Happy New Year! May the new year Vikari bestow you, your family, kith and ken a very prosperous life. May The New Year and Lord Rama bless Bharat that is India with a stable and dharmic government that takes India and Sanatana Dharma back to its illustrious past glory!

  

May We Pray To Lord Rama on Sri Rama Navami Day With This Prayer!

  

With best regards and pranams,
