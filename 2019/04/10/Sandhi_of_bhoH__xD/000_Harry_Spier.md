Dear list members,

  

I came across the phrasebho svāmin (vocative) in a shloka.

  

Neither MacDonell's grammar grammar nor Whitney's grammar say explicitly what the sandhi ofbhoḥ should be before s ,They talk about its irregular sandhi but they don't mention what it is before the spirantss ṣ ś .

  

I did a search of the GRETIL and Muktabodha digital libraries and
bothbhoḥ andbho before s occur, withbhoḥ before s occuring about 3 times as often asbho before s .

  

What do the grammarians say about the sandhi ofbhoḥ before s .

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
