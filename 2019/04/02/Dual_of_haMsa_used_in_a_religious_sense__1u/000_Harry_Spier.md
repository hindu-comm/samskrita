Dear list members,

  

1\. Monier-Williams dictionary says the dual ofहंस has been used to mean "the individual Self and the Universal Self" in the Upanishads, Mahabharata and Harivamsa.

  

Can someone give me the scripture and verse where the dual of हंसis used this way. I need quotations only where the dual of हंस is used this way. Not compounds ofपरमहंस and हंस

  

2\. He also says that according to Sayana it is resolvable into ahaṁsa "I am that".

Can someone tell me where he says this.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
