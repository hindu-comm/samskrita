I don't understand your confusions. As explained earlier,लक्षण is different from what was explained ear entirely different thing.  
The first it was used in feminine gender and not in compound with another word when it is used as one of three word powers. Why are you confusing between two words entirely different in application!लक्षण is another technical term in Nyaya shastra and it is entirely different.
