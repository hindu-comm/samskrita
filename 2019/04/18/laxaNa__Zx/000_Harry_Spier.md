Dear list members,

  

My previous question was aboutlakṣaṇā. This question is aboutlakṣaṇa which according to Monier-Williams dictionary has a much broader range of definitions. I have some questions about the use of the word with tsome of the definitions from Monier-Williams. The definitions from M-W are in blue and my questions in black.

  

  

  

lakṣaṇa n. (ifc. f(ā). ) a mark, sign, symbol, token, characteristic, attribute, quality (ifc. = ‘marked or characterized by’, ‘possessed of’), Mn. ; MBh. &c. \[ID=180385\]

  

For "Compassion is a quality of a dharmic man". can I sayकरुणालक्षनस्य धार्मिको नरः

  

  

accurate description, definition, illustration, Mn. ; Sarvad. ; Suśr.
\[ID=180391\]

  

Can I say:हितस्य उपदेशः हितोपदेश इति लक्षणस्य हितोपदेशः

  

  

a designation, appellation, name (ifc. = ‘named’, ‘called’),

  

  

For "The king named Nala." can I sayनललक्षणः रजा

  

  

reference, quotation, Pāṇ. 1-4, 84 \[ID=180396\]

  

Does this mean thatlakṣana can be used the same way as iti to define a quote?

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
