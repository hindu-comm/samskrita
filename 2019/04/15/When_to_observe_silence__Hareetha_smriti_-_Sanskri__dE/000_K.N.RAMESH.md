उच्चारे मैथुने चैव प्रस्रावे दन्तधावने । स्नाने भोजनकाले च षट्सु मौनं समाचरेत् the great dharmashastra author Haareetha has prescribe so.. while passing motion, having copulation, passing urine, while cleaning teeth, while taking bath and while having meals, one should observe strict silence..  
The smriti of Haareetha is accepted by almost all.. irrespective of their particular cults or Sakhas..
