Dear list members,

  

In M R Kale's edition and translation of the Hitopadesa there is a sanskrit commentary (I think its also by M. R. Kale. It starts:

हितस्य उपदेशः हितोपदेशः \| हितश्चासौ उपदेशश्च इति वा \| स एव लक्षणया तत्संज्ञः ग्रन्थः \|

  

Could someone help clarify the meaning ofस एव लक्षणया तत्संज्ञः ग्रन्थः \|

Does saṁjñaḥ in this sentence mean "name, title"? And what is the meaning ofलक्षणया in the sentence.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
