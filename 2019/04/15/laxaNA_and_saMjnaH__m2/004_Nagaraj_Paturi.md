lakśaṇā, vyañjanā are not meaning types.

  

abhidhā

  

lakśaṇā

  

and

  

vyañjanā

  

are śabdavr̥ttis

  

Meaning caused by abhidhā is called abhidhēyārtha

  

Meaning caused by lakśaṇā is called lākśaṇikārtha

  

 Meaning caused by vyañjanā is called vyangyārtha.

  

When the actual animal referred to by the word tiger is called monkey, the meaning of the word tiger there is called abhidhēyārtha

  

When a great human warrior is called as tiger , the meaning of the word tiger there is called lākśaṇikārtha

  

We don't talk of a vyangyārtha of a word tiger the way we talked about its abhidhēyārtha and lākśaṇikārtha .

  

In a sentence such as " Sir, does this village need a tiger to fear while you are around ?" , the implied meaning that the addressed person is as frightening and dangerous to the village people as a tiger " is called vyangyārtha. Here, the word tiger is used in abhidhēyārtha only. bhut the whole sentence of which it makes a part has a meaning that is not found directly in the words of the sentence or their combination. Such subtle implied meaning is called vyangyārtha.
