Yes. Others have explained well the three meanings. I am giving a example where you can find the difference. ln the word कुशल meaning skilled, clever, by अभिधा it means कुशान् लाति = one who cuts kusha grass. But the word is never used in this sense. But only it is is used in the sense of clever or skilled by लक्षणा. But itself suggests not directly but byव्यञ्जना, the cleverness of cutting kusha grass without cutting oneaelf his fingers. This is the difference.

  

Another example गङ्गायां घोषः the hut at the Ganges. It is clear that there cannot be any hut in the river Ganges, Hence the wordगङ्गायां conveys the meaning on the banks of Ganges byलक्षणा. And then conveys the meaning "holiness and cooling effect" as the result of the usage by sggestion or व्यञ्जना.

  

These two are two classical examples. In poetryअनेकार्थस्य शब्दस्य वाचकत्वे नियन्त्रिते । संयोगाद्यैरवाच्यार्थधीकृद्व्यापृतिरञ्जनं ॥

Whatever meaning beyond the Abhidha denotation becomes suggested in addition.
