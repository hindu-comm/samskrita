नमस्ते मूर्ति-महोदय !

The meaning connoted by a word is with reference to context.

  

Many Kannada surnames are surnames only in their contexts as surnames. Otherwise, they have interesting etymologies. Up to my matriculation I was in Karnataka and have good number of Kannadiga friends and of course am acquainted with their surnames.

दोडवाड - I think the etymology is (the family which lives in) दोड्ड big वाड house.

आनिखिंडी - I think the etymology is (the family whichhas) आनि / आनेelephant खिंडि at its gate.

Even the name of a village कल्हळ्ळि -I think the etymology is कल्ल stones / boulders हळ्ळि village, the place which is primarily boulders all over. I know this place. There is a वेङ्कटेश्वर temple there, on the top of a hill, which is all boulders.

  

In our place there used to be celebration of Dassera as नाडहब्ब - नाडु region, country, state हब्ब / हब्बु - festival, celebration.

  

Words संज्ञा-s have meanings. But the meanings have to be understood with reference to the context.

  

I guess,the लक्षणा-aspect includes "with reference to the context"

  

So बसवनगुडि would mean a suburb of Begaluru, only to the people in Bengaluru. Otherwise, if there is a Shiva-temple in a place, two friends agreeing to meet at बसवनगुडि would simply mean "meeting at / near the Shiva-temple.
