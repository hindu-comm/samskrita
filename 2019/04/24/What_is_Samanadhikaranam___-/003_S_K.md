A book on Vishishtadvaia says

  

"  

    Thus, the 
    Mahabhasya of Patanjali on Panini sutras defines : Samanadhi- 
    karanya is the power of words which have different meanings to 
    denote only one entity.â€™

    "

    Is this correct?  And if this is correct.  how do Srivaishnavites claim, based on samanadhikaranya that  EVERY god-name in a scripture like Rig Veda denotes Vishnu.?
