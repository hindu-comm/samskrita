Dear SK,

  

Let me guess given your anonymity:

\* You are doing research/PhD at one of the Western Sanskrit departments and will publish about your interaction here with right wing Hindu nationalists.

\* You follow the thinking of the likes of Sidney Pollard and Wendy Doniger on Sanskrit and Hinduism, and how the future of Sanskrit lies with their thinking in the West, and not with the Indians or traditional Sanskrit scholars worldwide who are to be excluded or vanquished versus engaged.

\* You don't like the current government in India or Sanskrita Bharati organization world-wide for the promotion of Sanskrit or Indian culture because that threatens the ownership of Sanskrit by your sect in the West.

  

If you or your mentors wanted honest discussion about future of Sanskrit, please discuss with scholars who hold opposing views such as Rajeev Mehrotra (who has written a book "The Battle for Sanskrit" and where your sectarian thoughts are ably repudiated) and Dr. Kak and many others in the West. But of course, they would not be an echo chamber and their arguments cannot be answered except by extreme prescriptive statements such as displayed in your posts.

  
Here's a short video by Dr. Kak if you have the time on Sanskrit (24 minutes long). Please feel free to invite him for discussion at whichever university you are a member of.

"From the times of Rigveda to now, Sanskrit has thrived and helped nourish young minds. Prof. Kak reveals the importance of chanting and speaking Sanskrit from a young age and how it helps in cognitive intelligence."  

  

Why are you here if you know we are all wrong and you are right?

  

Sincerely,  
Sanju
