A language lives by parents speaking to little children in that language and it being spoken in the street..

  

The use of Devanagari script today says nothing as to whether Sanskrit lives.

  

You can say that it "lives" through Hindi,Gujarati etc, if you use a peculiar definition of "lives".

  

Although Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada have a huge inventory of borrowed words from Sanskrit - they belong to a separate language family and are not descendants of Sanskrit.
