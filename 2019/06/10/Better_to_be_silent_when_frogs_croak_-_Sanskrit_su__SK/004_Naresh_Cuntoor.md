Even a beginner in Samskrit will understand much, much more of the Vedic extract you posted than the most fluent of English speakers would of Beowulf.  

Here, these are the first few lines of Beowulf I found online -  

  

Hwæt. We Gardena in geardagum,  

þeodcyninga, þrym gefrunon,  

hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon.  

Oft Scyld Scefing sceaþena þreatum,  

monegum mægþum, meodosetla ofteah,  

egsode eorlas. Syððan ærest wearð

  

  

Also, for a post claiming to defend Vedic Samskrit, the least one would expect is to get the shloka right. Or at least, know enough to copy/paste a typo-free version. But hey, facts are overrated for people who believe in narratives.

  

Naresh
