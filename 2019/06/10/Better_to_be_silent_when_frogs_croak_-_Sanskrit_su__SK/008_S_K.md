This person posts only to conduct combat and I don't expect him to comprehend my point.

  

I am not contrasting "Vedic Sanskrit" and "Classical Sanskrit" linguistically.

  

I am comparing the quality of Sanskrit works in the Vedic period and later scriptures.

  

Whitney is 100 percent correct that Sanskrit underwent a deprivation after the Vedic period in the form of overlong compounds, pervasive passive voice and not using finite verb forms.  

  

Mahabharata, Ramayana and Puranas are all written in mediocre sanskrit - totally lacking the power of the language used in Rig Veda.

  

The Sanskrit affected by posters posting in Sanskrit here is like a toothache.

  

Sanskrit is not a living language - and let us move on.

  

The attested ancient works are of immense importance - but English is the key to understand them, going forward.
