Not just Sanskrit - just about everything:

Nothing written about Rig Veda so far in any language can equal the Brererton and Jamieson translation.

  

Many early lexical items are only poorly understood and the early commentators like Sayana are often fanciful.

  

Sanskrit has almost impenetrable ambiguity due to Sandhi and compounding and only a historical linguistics approach can unravel the remaining mysteries in the older scriptures.  

  

English has become analytical (in the linguistic sense) to such an extent and has this astounding vocabulary that its expressive power is near-universal.

  

At any rate, most educated Indians now think in English and it is now an Indian language and is the most natural language to study Sanskrit in.

  

  

  

English is so rich that "ubtranslatable words like "dharma" and "Deva" can be left as they are in translation.
