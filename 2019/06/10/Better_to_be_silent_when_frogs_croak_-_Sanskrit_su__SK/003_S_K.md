This verse is a classic example of the "depravation" (per Whitney) of Sanskrit after the Vedic period.

  

Later Sanskrit writers couldn't be bothered to remember the complicated cases and tenses of Vedic Sanskrit and have avoided active voice and finite verbs like a plague  

  

Sanskrit died for a reason - it became sterile.

  

The verse above cannot be considered to be in the same language as

  

**हिरण्यगर्भः समवर्तताग्रे भूतस्य जातः पतिरेकासीत ।  
** स दाधार पृथ्वीं ध्यामुतेमां कस्मै देवायहविषा विधेम ॥*
