In the verse 66 of 18 chapter of Gita, there is this word "शुचः". I think it is a verb in the second person singular of the dhatu √शुच्, but the tense/mood I couldnt find out...

  

Also in this verse, the verb "मोक्षयिष्यामि" if think it is the dhatu causative √मुच् 6U in the first person singular inलृट्. But I think it should beमोचयिष्यामि, with च. Am I missing something?

  
सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज ।अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः ॥  

  

Thank you!
