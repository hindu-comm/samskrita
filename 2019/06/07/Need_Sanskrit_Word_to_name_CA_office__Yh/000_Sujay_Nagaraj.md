Dear all,

  

We are starting new consulting company for financial services, auditing, advisories etc.,

  

Thought to choose Sanskrit word based on vision.

  

**Vision :**

We wish to build CA FIRM which is Bigger than Big Firms (all are MNCs from outside India ). I pray god that our firm should mark Indian CA Firm in the world.

And provide service to its client of highest possible quality. Empower thousands of people by creating employment. Share knowledge.

A firm which will remain eternal / immortal even after our death.

A firm which will be **Creating Change that matters**

**                Powered by knowledge**

                **Always innovating**

                **Working Responsibly**

                **Giving back to society**
