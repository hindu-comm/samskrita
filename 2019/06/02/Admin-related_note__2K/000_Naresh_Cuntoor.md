As mentioned in a recent email, I persisted in a recent discussion much longer than necessary. Ordinarily, I would have simply ignored foolish claims and moved on. But I did not do that in the present case to help us work toward evolving better group policy.  

  

Several recent threads had prompted many of you to complain (some in the group, but mostly off-list). The complaints had a few common threads - disallow frivolous threads, require people to disclose their true identity (which at the very least, would hopefully act as a deterrent at willfully exhibiting stupidity), improve the quality of posts and ban repeat offenders from the group.  

  

Seemingly simple questions can sometimes lead to interesting discussions. So we would rather not close the discussion at the beginning itself. Some (very few) members have expressed a genuine desire to remain anonymous because of personal compulsions. On balance, we do not want to institute a blanket ban on anonymous posters. But threads like these provide reasons against continuing that policy.  

  

And finally, we have not banned any members from the group except for sending spam and scamming emails. Perhaps it is time to consider whether we need to rethink this policy. I will reach out to a few responsible, frequent posters in a few days for suggestions to formulate that policy.

  

Regarding improving the quality of posts, the best way to do that is start suitable discussions.  

  

Thank you for your patience,
