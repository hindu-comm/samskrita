Respected Prof.Dr.H..Bhat ji,

\>\>Do you mean the sentence quoted says the gender of Atman is is masculine? How did you arrive to such a meaning?

I mean the sentence quoted should have been इदम् आत्मा ब्रह्म.

I came to the above conclusion on my own taking आत्मा to be a neuter gender. (since brahman is beyond gender, aatmaa & brhaman is one & the same and brahman is a neuter word)

Then I referred the lexicon I found आत्मा is masculine.

My doubt is solved.

We can close the thread.

Thanks for the clarification Prof.Dr.H..Bhat ji,
