### The deadline for proposing a Special Panel is fast approaching - all proposals must be submitted by 30 June.

  

The 18th World Sanskrit Conference will be held in Canberra, Australia’s capital city, from 18 to 22 January 2021.The World Sanskrit Conference is the premier international forum for professional researchers and educators of the Sanskrit language and its literatures, and of the history, religion and cultures of premodern South Asia.

### The theme of WSC2021 is ‘Future Directions’. 

We want to take this opportunity to look forward with strength and optimism to imagine together where Sanskrit studies might be headed in the decades to come. How will globalisation, information technology, new theoretical approaches and interdisciplinary interactions shape our work in future?

We envisage a conference that draws on the best of Australian culture and hospitality, a conference that is relaxed, informal, friendly and inclusive. It will be our pleasure to welcome you to Canberra, a city planned as the capital of Australia and designed to harmonise with its setting in the surrounding landscape. It is known as ‘the bush capital’–and, yes, kangaroos do hop down suburban streets.

# General Information… 

WSC2021 will be held on the campus of The Australian National University, in Canberra, Australia. The conference will feature 22 regular thematic sections, listed below. For each section, a set of invited convenors, specialists in the respective fields, will assist in maintaining a high scholarly standard for the conference. Convenors will select individual papers for presentation at WSC2021 and nominate session chairs. The convenors will also be in charge of selecting and editing papers for publication in the proceedings, details of which will be announced in future communications.

# IASS Membership…

The 22 regular sections are listed below.

[TABLE]



# Travel and Visa Arrangements… 

# 

We urge participants to make their travel arrangements as early as possible to minimise costs. In addition, participants should familiarise themselves with any visa requirements that they might have for entering Australia.  
  
The Organising Committee cannot offer personal assistance or advice on how to secure the appropriate Australian visa, since the process differs widely from country to country. For more information and guidance, please consult the Australian Government’s official website (https[://w](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visi))ww[.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visi) ](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visi))and contact your local Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate for specific instructions as early as possible. The time required for securing a visa can be unpredictable and may be as long as several months.

As soon as your abstract has been accepted, we will be able to provide a letter of confirmation to help you secure your visa or travel funds.  
  
After you register, we will send the Australian government your details to facilitate visa applications. For this purpose, participants will need to supply country of passport, passport number, full name (as in their passport), date of birth, gender, current country of residence, and contact details (i.e., email, telephone, address) when registering.

# Sorry, No Travel Grants… 

# 

Travel to Australia is expensive, particularly for scholars coming from South or Southeast Asia, and we are making every effort to keep costs down. However, we regret the WSC cannot offer travel assistance. Participants should seek travel assistance, grants or bursaries from their home institutions or from governmental or international granting agencies.

# Student Prize… 

In the spirit of the conference theme, ‘Future Directions’, and spurred by our shared desire to encourage and support emerging scholars in whose hands the future lies, we will be awarding a prize for the most outstanding presentation by a currently enrolled Masters or PhD student. We will be inviting section convenors to nominate suitable candidates.

# Accommodation… 

Canberra offers a wide range of accommodation, both on- and off-campus. Participants will be able to book their own accommodation closer to the conference. The next circular will present a list of suggestions.

# Poets’ Forum and Scholars’ Debate…

As at previous conferences, we will be hosting a Poets’ Forum (*Kavi-samavāya*) and a Scholars’ Debate

(*Śāstra-cacār*). Further details will be provided at a later date.

# Excursions and Entertainment… 

We are keen to showcase the best that Canberra and Australia have to offer, and we are planning an exciting program of entertainment and excursions. Details to follow.

# About our Logo…

The WSC2021 logo includes a globe on the left which represents the universal nature of our conference and is inspired by our motto, *Vasudhaiva kuṭumbakam* ‘The whole world is our family’. The central element is based on the famous Aśoka-cakra. The wheel is significant for the major Indian spiritual traditions, and is also the national symbol of India itself. The third element is drawn from an Indigenous artistic tradition from Central Australia and represents four people sharing companionship around a fire.

With these three elements the logo expresses our aspiration for the World Sanskrit Conference: that scholars from all over the world will come together to learn from one another and share their love for this precious language.  
  
The WSC2021 logo was designed by Fiona Edge of Edge Design in Canberra. Its creation was sponsored by the Sanskrit scholars of Australia.
