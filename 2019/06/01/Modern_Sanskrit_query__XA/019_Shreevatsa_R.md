On lists of modern Sanskrit works more generally, see also the website of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, which contains a section called [“Adhunik Sanskrit Sahitya Pustakalaya”](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/ASSP/index.html)where you can read online, in digitized form, a handful of modern Sanskrit works (selected on what basis is not clear).

  

They have also published some relevant books; forexample “Modern Sanskrit Writings in Karnataka” by Dr. S. Ranganath is available from their [ebooks](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/ebooks.php) page (the same author has published many such [books](http://www.drsranganath.in/english-books/) by region and by genre, with other publishers). There is also “A Bibliography of Modern Sanskrit Writings” / आधुनिक-संस्कृतसाहित्य-संदर्भसूची by Prof. Radhavallabh Tripathi as chief editor.

  

You may also like to follow up from the [List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sahitya_Akademi_Award_winners_for_Sanskrit&oldid=897181976).

  

Hope this helps too,
