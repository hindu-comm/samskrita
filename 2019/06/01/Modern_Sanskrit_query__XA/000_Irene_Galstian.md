It's probably not news that Apte's book on Sanskrit composition is  
influential. However, it was written around the beginning of the 20th  
century. Have there been any studies on how Sanskrit style has changed  
in the past 110 or so years?  
Related to this query is another one: do there exist modern Sanskrit  
corpora? By 'modern' I mean Sanskrit written during the past century.
