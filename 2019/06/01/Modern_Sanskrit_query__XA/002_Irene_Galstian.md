Madhav Deshpande is indeed a blessed person. Thank you for the  
suggestions, I'll follow these up.  
In the meantime, if anyone has seen a list of current Sanskrit  
periodicals, please paste a link, or, if you have your favourites,  
please make a recommendation. Even ordinary news stories would be  
valuable, but the more genres the better, of course.
