My context for collecting the modern Sanskrit compositions in various genres was my rejoinder to Prof. Sheldon Pollock's thesis that Sanskrit lost its creativity after 1800. I started listing pointers to new creative works in Sanskrit between 1800 and 1950. I kept the 1950 boundary because I thought that would be viewed as artificial attempts by Independent India to revive a 'dead' language.
