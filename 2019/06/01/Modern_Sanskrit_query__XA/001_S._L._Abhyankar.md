वासुदेवानन्दसरस्वती composed गुरुचरित्रम् in 700 verses and is hence known as सप्तशती. Interesting aspect of this composition is that in every verse there is a letter from the 15th chapter of Gita. So recitation of the 15th chapter of Gita and of गुरुचरित्रम् simultaneously.

गुरुदेव रानडे was an accomplished philosopher saint. He set up his Ashram in Nimbal, Dist. Bijapur, Karnataka State. Hisचरित्रम् was composed in Sanskrit by one of his disciples Late Shri. Bhausaheb Apte of Jamkhandi.
