Dear Shri Abhyankar,  
  

Namaste!  
  

Hope, you are doing well!!  
  

After viewing a couple of your Videos, I opine that yours is really a wonderful work which could help the aspirants of Sanskrit in a big way!  
  

In this connection, I would like to suggest that it would be more convenient if you could provide a List of all your Videos published so far by simultaneouly giving the relevant Youtube Link.  
  

Secondly, you may also please think of giving the 'Transcripts' of each of your Videos in WORD or PDF Format.  
  

A line in reply about your health would be much appreciated.  
  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
