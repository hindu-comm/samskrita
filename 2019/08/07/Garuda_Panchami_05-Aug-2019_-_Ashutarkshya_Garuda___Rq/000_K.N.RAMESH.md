Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Garuda Panchami** (aka **Garuda Jayanti**) falls on 05-Aug-2019 (Monday), I am delighted to share a rare **Mantra** on **Sri Ashutarkshya Garuda mantram** taken from **Akashabhairava Tantram, Chapter 12**. This looks more like a **Mala mantram** which is typically used in the **havan** (fire ceremony, **homam**) after the main mantra homam.

  

The subsequent chapters elaborate the different **Garuda Yantras** to be used for different purposes. As Yantras are typically meant for the initiated, they can't be shared freely.

  

You might recall my earlier postings on **Lord Garuda** a couple of times a few years ago. There are not many hymns on **Lord Garuda** - there is one **Ashtottara** and one **Sahasranama**. I had shared the **Sahasranama** and **Ashu Garuda Kavacha** a few years ago. There are a few hymns by **Sri Vedanta Desikar** (**Garuda Panchashat**, **Garuda Dandakam**).

  

We have also seen before that, as per **Kalki Purana**, **Lord Garuda** and **Lord Sudarshana** were given to **Lord Vishnu** by **Lord Bilvodakeshvar (Lord Shiva)** .

  

Garuda worship is prescribed as an effective antidote for **Rahu/ketu** afflictions or adverse **Rahu/ketu dasha** or **gochara**. Garuda worship is also prescribed for skin diseases and snake-related afflictions.

  

May We pray to Lord Garuda on this Garuda Panchami day.

  

With best regards & Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
