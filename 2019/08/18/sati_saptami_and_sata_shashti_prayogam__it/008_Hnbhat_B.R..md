Iprobably can give the two grammatical rules for them without any nick names for the two usages :

  

यस्य च भावेन भावलक्षणम् (पा.सू.- २.३.३७)  

षष्ठी चानादरे। , २।३।३८.  

Probably the above rules that prescribe सप्तमी and षष्ठी in the usages explained as सति सप्तमी and सतः षष्ठी by Aravind Kolhatkar.

  

  

There was an earlier discussion on the different types of Saptami with names. I could not find find any of the two names सतः षष्ठी or सति सप्तमी in any grammatical works though I have heard the usages with sati.. I shall be obliged where the two names are used in any grammatical work. Below is the link to the earlier discussion:
