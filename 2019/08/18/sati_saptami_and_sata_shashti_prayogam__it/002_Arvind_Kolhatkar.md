V Srinivasan,

  

You perhaps meanसति सप्तमी and सत: षष्ठी.

  

Both these are employed to indicatecontemporaneity of two occurances.
An example of सति सप्तमी isन कूपखननं युक्तं प्रदीप्ते वह्निना गृहे - digging a well is useless if the house is (already) on fire. An example of सत: षष्ठी is the following line ofचाणक्य in मुद्राराक्षस ३.२७:नन्दा: पर्यायभूता: पशव इव हता: पश्यतो राक्षसस्य - while (their prime minister) राक्षस was (a mere) onlooker, the Nanda kings were slaughtered like beasts, one after another.

  

Addinionally, सत: षष्ठी is associated with a pejorative sense.
