I see what one would mean if they said that 6th usage is more personal  
or maybe even more dramatic than 7th. But I admit I'd like to gather  
more examples of pejorative use before I see clearly what is meant.  
Or, if no examples are immediately available, maybe there is a  
grammatical work that advises such usage as correct or preferable and  
lists the circumstances, in which case I'd be very happy with the  
reference to that work.
