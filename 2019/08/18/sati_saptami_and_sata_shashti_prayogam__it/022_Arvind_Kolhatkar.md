Irene,

  

Examples ofसति सप्तमी are plentiful but those of सत: षष्ठी are rare.
Yet, I believe, the following could be considered as illustrating सत: षष्ठी. Theअनादर (षष्ठी चानादरे) in them can be said to be in the sense that the second part says the opposite of what the first part would normally lead one to expect.

  

स्नेहं दयां च सौख्यं च यदि वा जानकीमपि ।

आराधनाय लोकानां मुञ्चतो नास्ति मे व्यथा॥

उत्तररामचरित १.१२

  

Here, casting out जानकी should cause remorse toराम but it does not.

  

गाङ्गमम्बु सितमम्बु यामुनं कज्जलाभमुभयत्र मज्जत:।

राजहंस तव सैव शुभ्रता चीयते न च न चापचीयते॥

सुभाषितम्

  

Here, swimming in सित or कज्जलाभ water should cause the swan to look whiter or darker but that does not happen (सैव शुभ्रता).

  

In paragraph 300(b) of Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar occurs the following observation:

  

>

> The construction is said by Hindu grammarians to convey an implication > of disregard or despite, and such is often to be recognized in it, > though not prevailingly." >

I could not locate any reference to the actual term सत: षष्ठी in Whitney but the above clearly points towards it.
