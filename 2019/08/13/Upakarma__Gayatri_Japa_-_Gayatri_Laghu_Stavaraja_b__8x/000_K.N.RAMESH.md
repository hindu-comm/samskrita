Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste.

  

As **Yajur Upakarma** and **Gayatri Japa** fall on 15th and 16th of August 2019, I am delighted to share a very rare King of Prayer (**Stavaraja**) known as **Gayatri Stavaraja** by **Sage Vishwamitra taken from Vishwamitra Kalpam**. **Sage Vishwamitra** mentions that reciting this hymn in the morning is the sure way to get all rightful wishes fulfilled including the fructification of Mantras (Mantra Siddhi). This is called Laghu Stavaraja (easy or short) and there is a longer **Brihad** **Stavaraja** by **Sage Vishwamitra** in the same Kalpa.

  

We have seen many many hymns on **Vedamata Gayatri** in the preceding years. We have also seen that **Lord Narayana** declares in **Devi Bhagavatam** that every **Dvija** is first a **Devi Upasaka** and then only he can call himself as belonging to the other **Shad-matha** (Vaishnavite, Shaivite, etc.). He also corroborates that **Gayatri Upasana** is mandatory but prayer to other deities are optional. He also declares that there is nothing beyond Gayatri (**gAyatryAH param nAsti**).

  

May We worship **Vedamata Gayatr**i with this wonderful prayer!

  

With best regards and Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
