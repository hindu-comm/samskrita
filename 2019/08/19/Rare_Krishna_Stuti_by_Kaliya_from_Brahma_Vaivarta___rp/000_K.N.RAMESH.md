Dear All,  

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Krishna Janmashtami** falls on **24-Aug-2019** (25th according to some other traditions, I am happy to shar a beautiful prayer on **Lord Krishna** by **Kaliya** taken from **Brahma Vaivarta Puranam**, **Krishna Janma Khandam** and **Chapter 19**. In this exquisite prayer, **Kaliya** seeks only one boon - that he is able to offer his service to **Lord's Lotus Feet** and is able to constantly remember **Lord** in all his births. He mentions that everything is immaterial. **Lord Krishna**, pleased with this prayer, grants his boon.

  

If at all there can be one real boon to anyone, can it be different from this? Everything else in this universe is fugacious.

  

May we pray to **Lord Krishna** with this beautiful prayer during **Janmashtami**!

  

With best regards and pranams,

  

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
