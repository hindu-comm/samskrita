It looks like a compilation for Bharathanatya Ganesha Vandhanam in different ragas set to misrachappu talam.  
Except to one word " nalguga" meaning "please bestow upon" in Malayalam, rest all words are Adjectives for Ganesha and verbs in Sanskrit. He is using notations for dance steps in between too.
