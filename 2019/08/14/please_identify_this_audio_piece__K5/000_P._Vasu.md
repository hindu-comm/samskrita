Request respected members to identify this pleasing song (audio attached, I could open it with vlc media player) which seems to begin with what sounds like

“Shree ganesha namostu te, sakalaagamata kaladharaa, shree sasemya shashankadhara suta, paahimaam kalayaanidhe -----

But a bit later on I hearsomething like “paarvathisvara preethanaay mama preeti nalguga ganeshvraa” ? whichsounds malyaalam like than Sanskrit

It is apparently a much performed piece and sosome ofyou may recognise it. Please let me have the correct words (whatever language they may be of) written for me in either in roman or devanagari

thanks and regards

P. Vasu
