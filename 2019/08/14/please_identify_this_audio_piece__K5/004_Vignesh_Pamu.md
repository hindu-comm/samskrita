Dear Vasu garu,

  

The audio piece is a Ragamalika named "Sree Ganesha" set to "Misra Chapu" Talam from the CD named "Sangeeta Lahari - Geetam, Vaadyam & Nrityam" by P.Unnikrishnan & V.P. Dhananjayan released by Swathi's Sanskriti Series.  

  

Earlier, in a music forum when some one reached out to V.P Dhananjayan for lyrics he replied as torefer to the the audio cassette/CD released by Swathi Solutions which has the printed script and music sung by P.Unnikrishnan both in Malayalam and English.

  

FYI, this you can buy from <https://www.flipkart.com/sangeeta-lahari-unni-krishnan/p/itmdnze9bvht5qxu>

or from<https://www.kalakendra.com/dance/bharatanatyam/performances/sangeeta-lahari-p-unni-krishnan-smp905>

It costs Rs.150/-

  

Best,
