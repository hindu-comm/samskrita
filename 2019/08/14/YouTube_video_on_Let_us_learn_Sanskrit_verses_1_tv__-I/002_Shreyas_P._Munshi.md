Respected Abhyankar Sir,  
A minor question. Normally the conjunction 'and' (=/ch/) comes after the word which is joined. Like  
"Rama and Lakshman"="raamaH lakshmaNaH ch".  
In tvameva maataa shloka,  
"tvameva maataa ch pitaa tvameva…..and so on", there is no /ch/ after 'pitaa'  
and no /ch/ after 'sakhaa'.  
Is it still oakay?
