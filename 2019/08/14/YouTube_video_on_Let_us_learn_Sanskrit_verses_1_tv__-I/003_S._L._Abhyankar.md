मुन्शीजी,

च is a conjunction for two clauses as well as for two words.

As a conjunction for two clauses it may be used only once, mostly between the two clauses.

In त्वमेव माता (असि) च त्वमेव पिता (असि)

Actually in the whole verse, there is no verb visible.

But because त्वम् is the subject-word, the appropriate verb, to be assumed to be there, would be (असि).

By that, it is to be understood that there are as many clauses as many times the subject-word त्वम्is.

Quite often, Sanskrit compositions are to be understood by understanding and assuming such invisible verbs.

Since it is all a matter of intelligent understanding, Sanskrit appeals to be a language for the intelligent.

One who knows, knows.

Even in गीता one comes across at quite a number of places the phrase यः पश्यति स पश्यति He, who sees, sees.

Hope, this clarifies.
