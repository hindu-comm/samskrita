नमस्ते !

In the new series of videos on "Let us learn Sanskrit verses"

Second one on उद्यमः साहसं धैर्यम्is uploaded just now at \<<https://youtu.be/wpDwgohvq8I>\>  

I think, that this is becoming good graded learning of Sanskrit.

Good number of verses would build a good Sanskrit repertoire.

I guess, this would be very helpful for those, who would like to groom and spread the Sanskrit culture.
