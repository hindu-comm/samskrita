Dear list-members,

  

I have been trying to put together a slogan in Sanskrit which is an elegant and natural translation of the English phrase "Head, Heart and Hands"

  

There are many words for "Head", "Heart" and "Hands" in Sanskrit, but I am unable to arrive at a good combination.

  

Could you guide on this matter? Any help would be gratefully received.

  

kind regards

harsha
