Respected Ramesh ji

  

I am used to reciting this mantra in the traditional way:

यतो यतः समीहसे ततो नोऽ अभयङ्कुरु । शन्नः कुरु प्रजाभ्योभयन्नः पशुभ्यः ॥

  

And both य are pronounced like ज as they are in the initial positions of a word and the sign ऽ (खण्डकार) indicates that there should be a slight stoppage (इषत्विराम)।  

  

Thank you for the भाष्य, though it differs from those of Uvata and Mahidhara.
