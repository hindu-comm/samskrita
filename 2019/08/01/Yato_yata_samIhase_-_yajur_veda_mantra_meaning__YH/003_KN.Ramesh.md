Respected Prakash Raj Pandey ji,

  

There was a query on this privately from Sri.S.L.Abhyankar ji also.

  

This is not in the part of Krishna yajur veda being chanted by us in South India..

Probably it could be in Shukla Yajur veda.

Abhyanakar ji,

I withdraw my reply given to you yesterday.

  

\>And both य are pronounced like ज as they are in the initial positions of a word and the sign ऽ (खण्डकार) indicates that there should be a slight stoppage (इषत्विराम)।

  

Quite interesting.. Any praatishaakya / text sir regarding the pronounciation sir...?

  

namaskarams
