Corrections:

  

In यतो यतः only the first य is pronounced ज. I have to look into other instances to come to any conclusion, and also put the "why" question to the learned ones.  
  
It is खण्डाकार not खण्डकार (That was a typo error).  
  
Ramesh ji,  
  
Yes, it is from Shukla Yajurveda, My shakha is Madhyandina Samhita.  
  
Rules of pronunciation are laid in शिक्षा, which is one of the six vedangas, and all the more important rules are in the Annex of Samskara Deepaka (Part I) of Nityananda Pant, available at
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.329456>. This book is also readily available in print. Moreover, Pranav Muley has some good videos in youtube, though he speaks a language I cannot fully understand, I can follow his pronunciation and hand movements. There are some other conventions related to pronunciation, but I am not aware of the texts to look into.   
  
Sumedha ji  
  
The book now I am using is one downloaded from<https://archive.org/search.php?query=Yajurveda%20with%20two%20commentaries>, so you can sure have the full book for yourself. I lost my grandfather's book, which was in four volumes. But that is a different story.
