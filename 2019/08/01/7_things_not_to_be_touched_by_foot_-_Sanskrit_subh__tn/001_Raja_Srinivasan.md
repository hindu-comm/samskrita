Thank you. I think this translates to:



Let the feet not touch the following Fire,Teacher(s), Brahmin(s), cow(s), girl(s), Old people, and Babies.



I am not sure if it the nouns are singular or plural, but it makes sense in all cases. I am also not sure when the poet says कुमारीं it refers to young girls or women in general. I am assuming that although this translates to “young girls”, the poet means “women”.



Please correct me if I am wrong.

  
Regards

Raja Srinivasan
