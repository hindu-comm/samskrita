कोलाहले काककुलस्य जाते विराजते कोकिलकूजितं किम्।  
परस्परं संवदतां खलानां मौनं विधेयं सततं सुधीभिः॥  
सुभाषितशतकम्॥

Trying to intervene in a conversation, or trying to give views or advice to people who are just arguing aloue vehemently and without any sense, is not right, not proper, and can even prove dangerous to the lone sensible person wo happens to be nearby..

This subhashitam conveys that idea forcefully  
-------  
meaning  
=========

When a large group of crows are making loud discordant and ugly noises, what is the relevance for the song of a cuckoo .  
Like that, when evil mouthed ruffians are arguing with one another, the wise men should invariably be silent  
=========

Analysis  
-----------  
काककुलस्य of a group of crows  
कोलाहले in the disorderly din  
जाते happening  
कोकिलकूजितं the sweet song of a cuckoo  
किं विराजते can shine?

परस्परं mutuallyसंवदतां talking aloud arguing  
खलानां ruffians  
मध्ये in the midst  
सुधीभिः by wise people  
मौनं विधेयं silence should be maintained.
