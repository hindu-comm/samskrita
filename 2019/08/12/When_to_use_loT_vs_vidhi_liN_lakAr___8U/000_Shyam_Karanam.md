PraNAms to the learned.

  

Can some one summarise the cases when loT, liN (vidhi and Ashir) can be used.

  

Can we use loT and vidhi liN for the case "icchA" ? How to zero in on a particular lakAr when the use case is common to one or more lakArs ?

  

विधि duty

निमन्‍त्रणinvitation (participation mandated)

आमन्‍त्रण invitation (participation optional)

अधीष्‍ट Asking for service/favor with respect

संप्रश्‍न Ask (whether to do or not)

प्रार्थनेषु request

icchA wish

  

Can we use other lakArs inplace of lRn lakAr

  

Regards
