The attached paper gives the correct description of anushtup:

"In anushTup in the even päda s after the first akshara na, sa, ra gana’s are forbidden ,

after the 4th akshara only ja gana is allowed. In the odd päda s after the 4th akshara if ya

gana is used, after the first akshara na and sa gana’s are not allowed (6 combinations); if

after the 4th akshara ma gana is used after the first akshara only ra gana is permissible (1

combination); if after the 4th akshara ra,bha or na gana is used, after the first akshara ya,ma

or ra gana has to be used (9 combinations)."
