Here is more data to compare with..

  

\\ The pedagogical organization of Rgveda is also in अष्टौअष्टकानि (each with अष्टौ अध्यायाः)।

  

\\ The तैत्तिरीयं (1.5.12) & शतपथं (6.4.2.10), ब्राह्मणे state that a year consists of 12 अष्टकाः. Probably referring to the 8th तिथिः of the कृष्णपक्षः।

  

\\ The अष्टमी is a very important तिथिः, and like the पर्वतिथयः this was also considered for अनध्ययनम् in pedagogy.

  

\\ On an अष्टमी the Moon is exactly at right angles with the Sun, as seen from the Earth, making observation of that तिथिः very easy, which "may" have had a special significance for measurement of time.
