अष्टक is a composition having eight stanzas. These are addressed to various gods and godesses and can be found inबृहत्स्तोत्ररत्नाकर or in similar compilations. A few fromबृहत्स्तोत्ररत्नाकर
areसर्वमङ्गलाष्टक, अच्युताष्टक, विष्ण्वष्टक,हरिनामाष्टक, हरिशरणाष्टक, जगन्नाथाष्टक etc.

  

The question is why has this format of eight parts become so popular.
IMHO, the answer lies in the fact that the number 8 is a 'soft' number and enjoys popularity that other 'hard' numbers like 7, 11, 13 do not.
As a number, 8 is neither too small like 2 nor too large and may appeal to a creator of a stotra as the optimal length in which to compose his stotra. (8 is a 'soft' number because a circle or a length can be very easily divided into 8 equal parts, a felicity not associated with other numbers in that range like 7,9,10 etc.)

  

The softness and the associated 'holiness' of 8 easily gets transmitted into other fields, not associated with devotion and prayer. Recitation ofमङ्गलाष्टक is an essential part of the wedding ceremony. The celestial world is supported on the backs ofअष्टदिङ्नाग. आयुर्वेद is अष्टाङ्ग, composed of शल्य, शालाक्य, कायचिकित्सा, भूतविद्या, कौमारभृत्य, अगदतन्त्र, रसायनतन्त्र, वाजीकरण. A complete prostration isसाष्टाङ्ग नमस्कार, in which the ground is touched by the forehead, the chest, two hands, two knees and two feet. The intensity of love or devotion is felt through अष्टसात्त्विकभाव. They are स्तम्भ, प्रलय, रोमाञ्च, स्वेद, वैवर्ण्य, वेपथु, अश्रु, वैस्वर्य.

  

Not only the number 8, but others like 108, 1008 are also similarly 'holy'. बृहत्स्तोत्ररत्नाकर lists गणेशाष्टोत्तरशतनामस्तोत्र, श्रीकृष्णाष्टोत्तरशतनामस्तोत्र, नारायणाष्टोत्तरशतनामस्तोत्र. Heads of religious sects are called by their followers as ShriShri 108Krishna Das Goswami Ji Maharaj orShri Shri 1008 Shantinath ji Maharaj.
