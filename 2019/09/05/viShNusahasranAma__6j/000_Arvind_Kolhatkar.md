Other members of the Group may already be aware of the following but it came to my notice by accident. I mention it here for the information of all.

  

The famous stotra calledविष्णुसहस्रनाम is a part of Mahabharat, appearing atअनुशासनपर्व १३, अध्याय १३५, श्लोक ०१४ - १२०. The stotra is recited by भीष्म to युधिष्ठिर. The full text of it, as in the BORI edition, may be seen at<http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/text/UD/MBh13.txt>. Its recitation by MS Subbulaxmi can be heard at<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TNE-i8ZvKs>
