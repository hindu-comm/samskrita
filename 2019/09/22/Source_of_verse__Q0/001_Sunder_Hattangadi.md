"A great rAma-bhakta and advaita scholar by name brahmasri

parasuramapantula lingamurthy garu, once got a vision of

bhagavan rAmchandra who instructed lingamurthy garu to

translate the Adhyatma Ramayana into telugu.

He was instructed by rAmachandra to compose a gloss

on “rAma-hridaya” of Adhyatma-Ramayana

which is pregnant with advaita-siddhAnta.......

Thus, Shri.Lingamurthy Garu composed a magnus opus called

“sItArAmAnjanEya-samvAda”. A beautiful work and gloss on

“rAma-hridaya” which culminates in universal vision of advaita.

This was said to be composed in 1760 AD.

  

The following are the last verses. After imparting the Upanishad vidya

to Shri Anjaneya, Lord ramachandra asks shri Anjaneya

whether He had understood the teaching properly or not.

  

Shri Anjaneya replies thus as:

  

shrI rAma ! rAma ! rAma ! ra, mArAmAmaNimanOramAramaNA shrI

nArAyaNa ! nArAyaNa ! nArAyaNa ! nijasahasranAma stutyA !

  

O Lord Ramachandra ! Thou art the form of brahmavidya

who is always sought after by rajayogis; thou art the

substratum of creation; thou art the repository of “aparoksha-jnana”.

  

Saying so, shri anjaneya says as:

  

dEhabuddhyA(a)smi dAsOham jIvabuddhyA tvadamshakah

AtmAbuddhyA tvamEva aham iti mE nishchitA matih

  

When I identify myself with “dEha”, I am thy servant;

when I identify myself with “jiva”, I am an aspect of thine;

when I shed both these abhimAnAs ie., jiva-bhAva & dEha-bhAva;

and identify with “kuTastha”, I am thee. "

  

This secret I understood with thy grace O rAmachandra !
