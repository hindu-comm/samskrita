Meaning of जलधि sea or ocean. In Kanada शरधि is also used in the same sense though in Sanskrit it means quiver. Kannad, Telugu and Tamil use Sanskrit word पाषाण meaning stone in the sense poison as in navapashana which I found yesterday. The same may be the case of sharadhi aso in a different sense.
