yes Bhat sir,  

thats what threw me off. its bit unusual to see similar meaning adjectives appear side by side. Thats why I started digging some info. Through google I could find two more usage for शरधे one meant same as you told.  

Other one appeared in अथर्ववेद सुबोध भाष्यम् but I could not find the usage because google did not take me that page and its pretty big document. I am scanning through to see if they used in any other context.
