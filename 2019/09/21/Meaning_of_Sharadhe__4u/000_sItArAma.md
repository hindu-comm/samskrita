Kamalajadala Vimala Su-nayana Kari Varada Karunaambudhe

Karuna Sharadhe Kamalaa Kaanthaa

Keshi Narakaasura Vibhedana Varadha Velapura Surottama

  

Can someone please tell the meaning of Sharadhe because everyone is happily singing that part as शारदे.  

Most of the online resources say this was a Keertana about Sarasvati however all the pointers are there for Lakshmi, like Kamalaja, Keshi Narakaasura Vibhedana etc

I would appreciate your help.
