Hi Irene,

  

The t-shirts are produced and serviced by [The Souled Store](https://www.thesouledstore.com/artists/resanskrit)and they only deliver in India at the moment. We deliver frames and posters internationally for which the servicing happens at ReSanskrit's end.

  

I can take this order manually and process it. Please drop a mail on [resan...@gmail.com]() with your requirement, I will share a PayPal link with you for the same.

  

Hope this works for you.

  

Regards,

Sushant
