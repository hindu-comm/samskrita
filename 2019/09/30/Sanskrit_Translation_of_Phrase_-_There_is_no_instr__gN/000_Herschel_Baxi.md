Greetings

  

In my high school days, I had come across a Sanskrit proverb "There is no instrument like patience" which I believe read as below in Devnagari script =

  

न तितिक्षा समम् अस्ति साधनम्

  

Is that correctly written? Would anyone know the roots of this proverb?

  

I would greatly appreciate feedback on both questions.

  

Thanks.
