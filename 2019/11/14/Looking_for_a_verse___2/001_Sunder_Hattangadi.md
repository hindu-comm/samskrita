[TABLE]

  

  

  

नमन्ति फलिनो वृक्षाः नमन्ति गुणिनो जनाः \|

शुष्क काष्ठस्य मूर्खश्च न नमन्ति कदाचन् \|\|

  

Fruit bearing trees laden with fruits bow down with their weight and benefit the people and so also virtuous persons , who always remain humble and helpful to other On the other hand dry wood (a dried tree) and dull headed and foolish persons never do so and are always rigid.

  

(The underlying idea behind this Subhashita is that noble and virtuous persons are always humble and and are always committed to help others and compares them to a tree bowing down with the weight of its fruits. In contrast dull and foolish persons are always rigid and unadjusting like dried wood.)
