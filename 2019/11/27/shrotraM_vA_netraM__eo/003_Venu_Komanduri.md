A beginner’s Sanskrita. In stead of asking the question directly I used the sloka.  
  
Indriyas receive the ‘vishaya’. In the sloka it is the ears. Current days man is most effected by what he ‘sees’ also. My question is to understand the equivalent words for the  
‘Srotavya’, ‘Srutasya’ if the sloka has to refer to theIndriya ‘eye’ and also to mention that this sloka also indirectly implies the effect of other Indriyas too.  
  
Thanks
