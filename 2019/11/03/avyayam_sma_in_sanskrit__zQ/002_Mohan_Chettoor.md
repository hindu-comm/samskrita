धन्यवादाः महोदय!I will get those suthras explained from my local gurus as I don't want to trouble you for this. Only one clarification, sir.. can we use 'sma' to mean 'used to' or 'was doing'?

Eg: My grandma used to tell stories.

  My grandma was praying when I woke up.

Can we use 'sma' in these two sentences?
