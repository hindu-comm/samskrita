मौलौ मन्दाकिनी यस्य मालतीमालिकानिभा \| मौनिमानसहंसोऽयं मौढ्यं हरतु नः शिवः \|\|  

A composition of Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal: It means: Let that Shiva upon whose head is the Mandakini (Ganga) like a garland of mallika flowers, who (Shiva) is the Hamsa in the mind of Sannyasins, dispel our delusion.  The writing is that of the Acharya Himself.  

We can notice the many occurrences of "m" which are beautiful to hear. If we count all the letters that originate partially or fully in the lips (oShTha sthAnam), then there are even more (pa, pha, ba, bha, ma, o, au, va). Absolutely delightful.
