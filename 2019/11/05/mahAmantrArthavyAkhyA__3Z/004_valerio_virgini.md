भजतः + चेतः= भजतश्चेतःThis is clear.  

The problem is that I found भजतो चेतःon the original text, so I wondered if, in Sanskrit literature, there are other cases of this anomalous sandhi.  

  

If, instead, there is an error in the text, भजतो चेतः could have been written instead of भजते चेतः  

  

According to you, based on the meaning of the verse, which would be the right word?.
