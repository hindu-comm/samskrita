    Jinasena

    MahaBandha.

  

Kashayaprabhrita (aka Kasayapahuda)

1.  Composed by Acarya Gunabhadra

2.  Acarya Yativrishsabha wrote a Curni {gloss} on the text

3.  Has an extensive commentary written by Acarya Virasena and Acarya
    Jinasena, called the JayaDhavala.

  

For a long time, these texts lay in obscurity in the grantha bhandaras of Karnataka where the Bhattaraka tradition played an important role in protecting these divine texts from the ravages of time. In the early 20th century, modern Jain thinkers such as Pandit Nathuram Premi, Professor Dr Hiralal Jain and Professor Dr Adinath Neminath Upadhye gained access to the manuscripts of these texts and began the herculean task of critically editing and translating these texts.   
  
Profound scholars such as Pandit Phulchandra Shastri, Pandit Kailashchandra Shastri, Pandit Hiralal Shastri (Sadhumal) and Pandit Balchandra Shastri joined the team led by Prof Hiralal Jain and Prof AN Upadhye, and translated the ancient texts into Modern Standard Hindi. It was an extremely difficult task and could only be completed because of the calibre of Pandit Phulchandra Shastri & Pandit Kailashchandra Shastri. This outstanding team worked hard for several decades and had to weather many storms from within the community. But they persisted. And one day, these impeccably translated ancient texts became available to the public.

  

The present editions have the mula patha {original text} in Prakrit, followed by an extensive commentary in Prakrit & Sanskrit, and an expert Modern Standard Hindi translation by some of the most distinguished scholars of the 20th century.

  

It is our dream that each Jain temple and each Jain library should have one set each of the Shatkhandagama and the Kashayaprabhrita.

  

These magnificent tomes are available at our bookstore and through mail-order. We ship books all over the world and accept payment by IMPS, NEFT, Paytm, Visa and MasterCard.
