Water and speech have the power of drowning or saving us. Drinking clean water is essential for life and good for health. Drinking poisoned water can lead to death. Similarly, speaking kind and truthful words can make the world a better place. Poisoned words can cause wars and mass destruction. Just as water can save the life of a man dying of thirst, speech, provided it stems from the teachings of the scriptures, can save a man's soul.

  

A kulaka is a compilation of stanzas on a related subject. In the Jain tradition, several kulakas have been composed by learned scholars. The stanzas are based on a certain subject, and present a veritable treasure of verse which may be memorised easily and recalled at will.

  

The Gunanuraga-Kulakam is a collection of related verses on the importance of appreciating the good qualities of others. It has been composed by Acarya Somasundara Suri, who is believed to have lived in the 14th century CE.

  

In this work, the learned author explains to us the importance of appreciating and imbibing the good qualities of others. He advises against spending our energy and time on criticising others. Instead, he asks us to change our attitude and look for the good in others. Our energies should be focused on learning good things. Thus we will become better, more fulfilled people. Going on in the same spiritually nourishing vain, he says that one should appreciate the good qualities of all mendicants, irrespective of their sect.

  

The author is clear that the best way to destroy one's own passions of anger, arrogance, artifice and avarice is to sincerely appreciate the worthy qualities of others. This allows us to develop the same fine qualities in ourselves. Also, it helps us to widen our horizon and adopt an ecumenical approach to life.
