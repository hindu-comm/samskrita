Hello, I'm looking to demonstrate to my fifth grade students the best classical poetry from around the world. I'd like to include a Sanskrit poem, preferably short (OR possibly some short, famous section of a longer work.) I know almost nothing about Sanskrit poetry, but in my short amount of research I have found that Kalidasa's Megadhuta is very charming. I was thinking perhaps the opening verse of that poem. If only I could find the original Sanskrit typed out with transliteration and word-for-word translation.

  

Does anyone have a link or can type out such a poem? I'd like it to be a well known poem by a well known author, with original Sanskrit, a transliteration and a word-for-word translation. I have received suggestions on other forums, but non included the original Sanskrit.

  

Sanskrit is an important historical language and I think that its great poets should be more well known.
