Sir,

  

It is commendable that you would like to include classical sanskrit poetry to your students. Kalidasa's Meghaduta is like the cream-filled topping of the ice cream that is Sanskrit.

  

Have you gone through these youtube playlists. They feature some of the best poetry in the range of Sanskrit literature. There is diversity, good selection of verses, transliteration and an explanation in lucid English. And it can be well studied and appreciated by your students on their own!

If you want to specifically show them a few poems, do consider the following -

Best!
