Respected Scholars

  

  

I fully subscribe to the observations and views of Sri Dhananjay. But in some software for typing devanagari letters using Roman keyboard, like Baraha, not all compound consonants are provided for. For example dya is reproduced as अद्य, मद्य etc. Further, I have observed in some places (in UP) in combinations like vda or bda (as in शब्द), the position of the halanta va or ba in the hands of some painters goes down from the left making it dba or dva instead of bda and vda.



For us in Tamil Nadu, our mother tongue has no provision for any compound consonant, except the occasional क्ष. All compound consonants are to be represented as in baraha adya madya etc. Even क्ष is generally represented by the combination of tcha (ट्च) as in काक्षि written as काट्चि\*. A sanskrit primer says that though क्ष is a combination of क and ष, in anticipation of the moordhanya ष, क's position is shifted from kantha. That is why it is given a different symbol instead of the two components. Similarly, Dr Bhatt was pointing out the variations in ज्ञ, its symbol different from the two components ज and ञ and varying transliterations from different regions.



\*To the little extent I know, while English and Sanskrit are rich in compound consonants Indian Regional languages shun compound consonants except very few combinations. The combination of four consonants in English as in instrument or five in Sanskrit as in कार्त्स्न्य are possible only in these languages. Even in Hindi with a large Sanskrit background दुग्ध becomes दूध, अग्नि becomes आग and चन्द्र becomes चान्द. चन्द्र is चन्दा in Telugu (and in older Hindi in some parts) and चन्दिरन् in Tamil. The combination of three consonants ndr is not retained in any of these languages.
