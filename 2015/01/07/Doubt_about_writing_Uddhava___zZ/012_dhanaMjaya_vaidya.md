One would need to fight that fight with पाणिनि, who made the rule "झलां जश् झशि ।" without exception, and tell पाणिनि that he forgot to note the exception for उध्-दव\*. While we are at it, also blame कात्यायन and पतञ्जलि, who fixed every itsy-bitsy lacuna that पाणिनि had missed, that they forgot this biggie!  
  
\*If there ever were a word that started off as उध्-दव, this rule would necessarily convert it to उद्-दव before it could be a final usable form. Of course, what "उध्-दव" could mean in संस्कृत is mysterious.
