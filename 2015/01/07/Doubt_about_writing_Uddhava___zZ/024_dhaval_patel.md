The discussion has wandered far from the original question.  
Let's keep it focused on the question at hand.  
  

As regards the side-discussion of 'brahma'-  

This has already been discussed quite long ago in <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/samskrita/%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE/samskrita/l85fCym6klM/qUrKi7qb0xcJ>.  

It makes sense that we continue discussion there only for sake of completeness and continuity.  

To recapitulate - Dr. H N Bhat pointed out that shiksha is the proper place to look for pronunciation and not other texts. He quoted the following verse for the question at hand.  
हकारं पञ्चमयैर्युक्तमन्तःस्थाभिश्च संयुतम् ।  
औरस्यं तं विजानीयात्कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ॥१६॥  

  

This differentiates 'aurasya' and 'kaNThya' variety of hakAra.  

But whether this justifies the 'mh' pronunciation or not was still under question.  
  

Mr. Lalitaalaalitah suggested that we look into some commentaries of shiksha, but unfortunately it was not followed up.  
  

So, let's expore commentaries of shiksha and pratishakhya to check whether there is some hint in them regarding pronunciation of this aurasya variety.  

Please post your findings in that thread.  
  

With regards
