A final note on the structure of the word. ud+dhava \> ud+hava both  
leave the findal form with the first consonant "d" AND the next  
consonant "dh+a whether you pronounce both as dh+dha, d+dha, or dh+da  
- as some of the postings suggest. It is only writing conventions of  
the ligature letters and does not affect the meaning of the word.
