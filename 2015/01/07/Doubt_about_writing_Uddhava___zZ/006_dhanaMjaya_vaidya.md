People have a choice between writing द्.ध and द्ध. Of course, with costs and benefits. The prior would make it unambiguous, but make a person appear as though they did not learn a symbol/glyph that other educated people learned. It also would have to come with a footnote about the exceptional "." symbol, which has no parallel meaning in any other glyph of devanagari script.  
  
It would also make the writer appear rather the lazy foreigner who did not want to learn writing symbols carefully, and didn't care that people found their writing weird.  
  
All of these social embarrassments can be avoided by carefully taking the time to write the द and the ध vertically, which makes the ligature symbol fully regular.  
  
Writing according to the rule doesn't even have the cost of learning an exception. Even though writing carefully is a time cost, it is not a terrible and wasted cost. Careless writing could lead to many other symbols that would confuse the reader.  
  
So to me, the choice is clear. The cost-benefit analysis is that learning to write one symbol according to the rule is better than making up an exceptional and unknown-to-natives द्.ध symbol.
