I wasn't suggesting that hma in brahma or in hmalayati cannot be pronounced as you have noted in the second half of the email. So let's set that aside.  

  

The uNAdi sutra is indeed relevant sutra to this part of the thread. Couldn't the same sutra be used to support the bram-ha pronunciation? I say this because, we have  
  

बृंहेः नः अत् च  

Copying मनिन् from the previous sutra,  
बृहेः नः मनिन् अत् च  
  

In other words, isn't the नुम् being replaced by both मनिन् and अत्  

  

If only अत् was the intended आदेश, wouldn't it have been बृंहेः नः अत्, and मनिन् sutra appearing after that with some suitable modification?
