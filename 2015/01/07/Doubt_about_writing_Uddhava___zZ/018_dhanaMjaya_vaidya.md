The authour of the उणादि सूत्रs gives the etymology of ब्रह्मन् as बृंहेर्नोऽच्च (मनिन्) । 4.146, i.e., in the root बृंह् (बृन्ह्), replace the intermediate न् with अ, and then add the termination मनिन्, which comes to ब्रह्+(the प्रत्यय) मन्.  
Do we have any basis of believing that the author of the उणादि सूत्रs did not actually hear the म्-sound before the ह्-sound? Quite the opposite. If the उणादि-author had heard the म् before, he would not have specifically had the nasal (न्) before the ह् replaced with a non-nasal. He could have made the सूत्र "बृंहेर् अनिन्, नोऽमुच्च ।" The fact that he deliberately asks the replacement of the nasal before the ह् with a nonnasal means that this is not an oversight, and in the final form, he did not hear any nasal sound before the ह् in ब्रह्मन्.  
Sorry regarding हे मपरे, which answers someone elsewhere, at another time, who was arguing with me that the ह्म sound is not physically producible, and was never produced in संस्कृत. Obviously, you state that in the form ह्मलयति it is produced. I mistakenly thought that you also were arguing that ह्म was not "naturally produced", I apologize. So the उणादि explanation is for the specific word ब्रह्म, which you mentioned.  
By the way, even other "final" forms of बृंह् and तृंह् always end up with an अनुस्वार, never with "न्ह" in पाणिनीय usage. This is discussed by various commentators on पाणिनि's "अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि". I believe that in no standalone\* word in पाणिनीय संस्कृत does ह् appear as the second-or-later consonant of any conjunct. (\*why "standalone"? Because it may be the second when two words are said in sequence, as in "किम्ह्मलयति".)
