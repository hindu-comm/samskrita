The dot was just to ensure that the d and dha appear distinct in my email. One would write ddha without a dot in between, i.e., द्\<nospace>ध.  
  

In hand written text, I have seen some writers using ट्.ट instead of ट्ट (again, ignore the dot in between). So I don't think it's entirely unprecedented.  
  

The interest of clarity, it seems to me should trump perceived embarrassments. Case in point, brahma vs. bramha, vanhi vs. vahni, etc. If indeed, as most people say it is pronounced as bram-ha, why not write it as ब्रम्ह ? Tangential, I know.
