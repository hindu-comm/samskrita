You're right. I was thinking of manin as 'm', which is clearly wrong.  
  

If this clearly points toward brah-ma, and no conflicting evidence points to bram-ha, it is surprising that most scholars say bram-ha (and give justification?). Do we chalk this up to prakrit influence and nothing more than that?
