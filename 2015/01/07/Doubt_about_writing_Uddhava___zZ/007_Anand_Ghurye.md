Dear Dr. Bhat ,  
  

When it is written as  
उद्धव  
  

I believe it needs to be pronounced as उध दव ( dha comes prior to da )  
  

Whereas it is actually pronounced as उद धव  
  

We can compare it with  
अन्तर ऊन्मत्त ( sorry for the big U )  

the Na is pronounced first then the Ta or Ma .  

  

  

Please clarify .  
  

Thanks in advance.  

  
  
  
  

  
  

  

  
  
  
Regards ,
