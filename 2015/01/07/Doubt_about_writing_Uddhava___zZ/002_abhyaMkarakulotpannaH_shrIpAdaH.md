While I agree with Dr. Bhat that style of writing will depend upon the script being used, I would like to add from my school days' memory.  
  
In the city library at Jamkhandi, there used to be amagazine, from Vardha, I think it was started by Vinobaji. Rather he was the editor. In that magazine all conjoined consonants used to be printed separately and in the order of pronunciation. So उद्धव would be printed as उद् धव. I am leaving space between द् and ध. But it seems परंधाम प्रकाशन had type-settings to print द् and ध separately, though alongside of each other. Possibly it was Vinobaji's style to ensure pronunciation in the right order. So will ब्रह्म be ब् र ह् म That was a little painful for reading, at least for me.  
  

Coming to different scripts, in Tamil uddhava, would be written as uttava, because they have only 't' for t, th, d, dh. உத்தவ  
  

In Kannada, although द् would be written before ध्, द् will be prominent and ध् will have a level like that of a subscript.
