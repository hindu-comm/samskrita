I think the word is correctly written and pronounced as उद्धव उद् धव.
Inद्ध what you see is halfद्, shown asद minus its tail. It is followed byध, which actually uses as itsदण्ड part the apparent tail ofद. 

  

Halfद is always shown like this when anotherconsonant comes after it as  This happens in only five other situations -द्द, द्म, द्य द्र द्व. (Due to the inability of the typing software it is not possible to renderद्य and द्व in the exact manner in which these are written but they can be seen in several printed works.) In all these situations the tail ofद is missing, making itद्, and the next letter is full, its upstandingदण्डtaking the place of the missing tail ofद.
