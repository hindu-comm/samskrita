(Many of my teachers say "brahma", but most of my family members, quite well educated too, do say "bramha", as you observe.)  
  
I think this is because of the influence of our first language, whichever modern Indian language we learned. In the prAkRtas the h+consonant is not available, bur consonant+h was seen in the derived word. As I said before, in pAli and other prakRtas, the convention is to write as they speak. But some modern Indian languages reverted in writing to the sanskRta form, even though they did not revert the pronunciation, which remained prAkRta.  
  
We also see highly educated telugu speakers say "कमळा", hindi speakers say "गोम्ती", etc. Our mother tongues have a strong influence on our saMskRta pronunciations. It is fortunate that those of us who are multilingual know that the various modern regional pronunciations of ज्ञ (hindi ग्य, gujarati ग्न, marathi द्न्य, etc) cannot all be correct in saMskRta (and are all wrong), but a vast majority of well-educated people continue to pronounce words with ज्ञ exactly as it would be (correctly) for their mother tongues. But it is common to see well educated people who know only one modern Indian language, and saMskRta insisting that they have the correct pronunciation.  
  
While I have managed to correct my mispronunciation of ज्ञ and ब्रह्म/चिह्न/आह्वान/आह्लाद (respective correct Marathi pronunciations being ब्रम्ह, चिन्ह, आव्हान, आल्हाद), in spite of my efforts, my accentuation of saMskRta words is pretty bad. I often incorrectly accentuate the first syllable of nouns (most saMskRta nouns are accented - as per paNini/shAntanava - on the last syllable). That again is because of transference from my mother tongue (where first-syllable accentuation is very common for the derived noun).
