Regarding ह्म/ह्न versus म्ह/ह्न.  
This would depend on the language. Fortunately for us पाणिनि in his सूत्रs "हे मपरे वा", "नपरे नः" telks us: in the language he was describing the ह् sound preceded the म/न sounds.  
In some of the early प्राकृत languages the pronunciation order flipped - and the writing is also appropriately flipped in say, पालि. (E.g. the पालि words तुम्हे, तण्हा, etc).  
Unfortunately, in many modern languages, the संस्कृत writing came back, even though the pronunciation is प्राकृत-style.  
In मराठी, for the last hundred years or so, since the grammarian दामले, the म्ह/न्ह writing is standard. But this is not the case in हिंदी. We have to be careful, there, though. In the strictly correct standardized version of हिंदी, spoken only by a few television newscasters and pandits, the pronunciation is as in संस्कृत.  
In any case, this is a संस्कृत discussion group. We have the choice of saying that our प्राकृतized (mis)pronunciations of संस्कृत should change our writing\*; or the alternative is to accept that the संस्कृत writing ह्म/ह्न is appropriate for the पाणिनीय version of the language.  
\*Then we would also need to modify the writing of कृति in संस्कृत to क्रिति/क्रुति as per the common प्राकृतized pronunciations, throw away one of the श/ष symbols because most people pronounce them the same (this adopted in standard Goan कोंकणी writing). But I believe that it would be better to learn that ऋ was indeed pronounced independently, and श/ष had different pronunciations in classical संस्कृत, and we should leave the writing of संस्कृत as is. We should, however, change or regularize the writing of modern languages as per modern pronunciation.
