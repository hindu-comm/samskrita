Also, I don't quite get it: बृ(नुम्)ह् -> ?बृ(अ मन्)ह् -> ब्रमन्ह्  
?बृ(मन् अ)ह् -> बृमनह्  
  
The first would be an extremely unusual word with two consonants at the end, and would probably have the declensions ब्रमा, ब्रमंहौ...  
The second would probably be declined बृमनद्, बृमनहौ...  
  
So this innovation would not get the desired ब्रम्ह.  
  
I believe the original सूत्र is pretty clear in terms of अन्वय. I don't think there is much freedom to reinterpret the traditional reading.
