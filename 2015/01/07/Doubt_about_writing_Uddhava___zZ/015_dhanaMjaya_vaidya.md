\> Is it possible at all to  
\> pronounce उध्-दव naturally?  

"Naturally" probably depends on language context. This pronunciation is not available (not "natural") in any संस्कृत word. Nor in many of the modern संस्कृत derived languages, inside of a single morpheme. But it may happen in other contexts. It may be heard perhaps in हिंदी, with ध् at the end of one word, with a द-initial word following in a compound (so no pause in between). Someone trying to clearly enunciate बोधदाता in हिंदी, after the obligatory पदान्त-अ-लोप (schwa deletion) would say बोध्-दाता. Thus the pronunciation is possible. However, even in हिंदी, if spoken at normal speed, the pronunciation would morph into बोद्-दाता.
