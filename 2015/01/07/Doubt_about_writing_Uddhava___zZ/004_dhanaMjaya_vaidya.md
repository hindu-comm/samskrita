There is justifiable confusion regarding the glyph/symbol for the द्+ध ligature. This confusion is seen not only amongst early students, but also among adults who are very fluent in their Devanagari writing.  
  
This confusion comes from ambiguity in the horizontal-joining and vertical-joining methods of generating ligature-symbols.  
  
For most consonant combinations, there is no confusion. But sadly, द्+ध
is visually confusing.  
  
(a) When the non-final consonant-symbol of a ligature has a symbol with a vertical line at the right side (ग, म, भ), a horizontal joining is preferred (ग्म, म्ल, भ्य) with the first sounding symbol to the left, and the next sounding symbol to the right.  
(b) When the non-final consonant-symbol of a ligature does not have a clear vertical line at the right side (ट, ड) then a vertical joining is preferred (ट्ठ, ड्ढ - not sure if this came out vertical in your font, but check printed books), with the first sounding symbol to the top, and the next sounding symbol below.  
(c) There are a large number of ligatures where both the horizontal or vertical joining are in seen in print. E.g., both horizontal or vertical joined versions of क्क न्न च्च क्व may be found in printed books. It depends on the aesthetic preference of the writer or the community. In Marathi, for example, vertical joining is preferred when there both options are available.  
  
Now for the problem of द्+ध versus the theoretical possibility of ध् + द, a combination that is grammatically never found in Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani.  
द्+ध : Because the symbol द does not have a clear vertical bar to its right side, a vertical joining is preferred, so द्ध; the earlier sounding "द" has its symbol above and the later sounding ध has its symbol below. Notice carefully that they are not on the same horizontal level.The little vertical line at the bottom on the joint symbol does not belong to the द, but it belongs to the ध.  
  
The theoretical ध् + द. Because ध has a clear vertical line to its right, a horizontal joining would have been theoretically preferred. (Again, there would never be a practical occasion for writing this ligature, except in theoretical discussions like this one.) So then you would get the horizontal joining ध्द. But look carefully, in this theoretical ligature symbol, the ध is clearly at the same horizontal level as the following द. If you do not look carefully, you may think that this theoretical ध्द (ध् + द, same horizontal level) looks identical to the commonly used द्ध (द्+ध two vertical levels)  
  
All we have to remember is that the द्+ध ligature is preferentially vertical-joined, and the vertical joining is as per the usual rule: first consonant on top, next consonant below.  
And that ध् + द is never to be practically found in Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi or Konkani (don't know about Nepali, I would be shocked if Nepali had it). So the question of getting confused about this horizontal joining never arises in practice.  
  
So while writing -ddha- in "uddhava", write द on top and ध below it (both symbols written smaller, to fit within the line spacing).  
  
The Marathi language department of the government of Maharashtra has a helpful guidance document regarding these ligatures, but it may not be of interest for the samskrita group.
