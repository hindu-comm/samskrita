In Devanagari, itself, j+nh or j + ñज् + ञ् has got a conjunct form, ज्ञ where you could not identify the parts or which part precedes or which part follows. One can say only ज् is the only form in isolation and ज is the form j+a and in क्य you can see the first part halved, while it can be written क्-य which could not be typed in without space without the conjunct form, whereas it could be written kya as three letters are distinguishable. In the conjunct, क्ष क्त the parts are not visible, whether k+t+a are written in order as in roman, askṣa or kSa or ksha, used in roman script. In the last, k-s-h-a four letters are used, whereas in the first and second, three letters are used, while in Sanskrit, the conjunct form is considered as distinctly a single conjunct letter for all purpose and in alphabets also they are generally given as two distinct letters in the alphabet, along with with, त्र in basic text books. So it is the convenience and availability availability of the letters used in a script in writing the language Sanskrit and there is no question of correctness in general. The last conjuncts create problem for identifying their correct pronunciation, and ज्ञ is written many times, jnhya, gya, etc. without USING IAST roman script, which has got only ñ single letter jña three letters of English alphabet.
