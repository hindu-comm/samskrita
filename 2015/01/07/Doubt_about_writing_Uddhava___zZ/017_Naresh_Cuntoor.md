But in above sutras, the starting point is ..म् ह्म (or equivalently with 'n') . The म् is not relevant to the question of brahma.  

In ह्मलयति or the other standard example, is it even possible to pronounce म्हलयति ? At best it would be उम्हलयति or मलयति, no?  
  

Whereas in brahma, ब्रह्म and ब्रम्ह both lend themselves to distinct pronunciation.  
  

It seems to me that trying to apply "हे मपरे वा" would be putting the cart before the horse.
