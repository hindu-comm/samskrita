Thomas,

  

 You are not likely to find illustrations or evenexplanations that are useful.

  

Dharmigrāhakamāna is referring to thathighest state of mind, that of pure consciousness.

  

Its nature is debatable, some say it is a entity, a divineentity, and as such *the proof of the existence of the One*, whose name is Aum.

lies in the realisation of that state - Dharmigrāhakamāna.

  

For others, it is not an entity but a state ofan entity, in this case the entity being the brain.

  

Due to its somewhatabstract nature,it goes by many names.

  

Theterm in question occurs in Gotama's Nyāya.
