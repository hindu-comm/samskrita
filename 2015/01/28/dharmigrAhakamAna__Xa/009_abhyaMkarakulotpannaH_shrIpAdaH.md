I appreciate your perseverance, Dr. Bhat !  
  

But I think Mr. Ramesh is wanting to know the Sanskrit text, where the term "धर्मिग्राहकमान" is *defined / detailed*. I guess he is not wanting texts where the term has been *used*. It seems ".. Dharmigrahaka-pramana,. i.e., an argument which proves at once both the existence and characteristic of a thing .." becomes quite some definition of धर्मिग्राहकप्रमाण if not of धर्मिग्राहकमान. But again this definition is in English, not in Sanskrit.
