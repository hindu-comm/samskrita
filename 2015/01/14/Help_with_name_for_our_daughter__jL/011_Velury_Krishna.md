Namaste,

Aparna also means reliever of debts, aparna chandika chanda munda sura nishoodini,(sri lalithasahsranama) 754th Nama. i just keep chanting lalithasahsranama, so immediately this name came to my mind. Beyond this i do not know the meaning. I am not a Sanskrit Scholar. My father revered Sri V.Sadanand was a gold medallist in sanskrit from benares hindu university. I am a Panditaha Putraha Shuntaha.

  

Pranaams,

V.Krishna
