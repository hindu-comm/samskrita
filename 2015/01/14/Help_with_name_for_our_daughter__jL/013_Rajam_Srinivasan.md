Vishvaanandita -- The Bliss (of the Universe) OR Vishva Smitha (Smile of the Universe) It is as if she is the Whole Universe of bliss to you OR She is your whole universe of Smile!!

  

(I stilll cherish and am mentally nourished by the fanciful nick-name my father had bestowed on me with a story to go along with it -- "VishNu-smitha" (it seems that once when VishNu was bored he conjured me up with the "makaranda" of his "Vyjayanthi maala", which brought a smile to his face -- so I was Vishnu-smitha, the bringer of smile to vishnu! :))))))) Actually I almost believed it right up to my highschool days!!!
In the whole of BrhmaaNDa I was the the most unique -- the only one created by VishNu and not Brahma -- the ordinary creator of everything else!!!!
