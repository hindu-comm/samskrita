Namaste,

  

paryanka-shaucha is the prAyaschitta karma performed by those brahmachArIs prior to entering into sanyAsa Ashrama. The vaTu, after upanayana, enters into brahmacharya deekSa. Till, he gets married, he shouldn't sleep on the bed. So, any doSAs done by brahmachAri ( like accidental sleeping on bed), is washed off by performing this karma called "paryanka-shaucha" which involves applying of mud from hip to feet and chanting of shaucha mantrAs.

  

regs,

sriram
