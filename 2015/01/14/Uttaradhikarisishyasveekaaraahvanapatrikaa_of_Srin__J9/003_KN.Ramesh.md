In the video the details about this is told from 13:42 to 14:42.

  

This is done after the nootana sanyasi crosses this ocean of samsara taking the Gyana as the boat( Thats why boat is depicted as hamsa).Here the nootana sanyasi crosses tungabhadra river with boat depicted as hamsa.

  

Rough translation with my little understanding is this:( I dont know kannada).

  

It is a part ordained by Dharma sastra's karma bhaaga . This has to be done by a Gruhasta on the nootana Sanyasi. The Gruhasta has to take 5 balls made of mud (or sand...??) He has to wipe 5 times from knees to legs. 5 times wiping on the back side of knee to leg portion,4 times wiping on the front side of knee to leg portion,3 times wiping on the sides of knee to leg portion, 2 times wiping on the legs,1 time on the leg endings, then cleaning of hands 10 times with the mud balls. This is called पर्यङ्कशौच . Then the nootana sanyasi becomes eligible to sit on Vyakhyaana simhasana.
