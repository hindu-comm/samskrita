Dear Debabrata,

Kaularahasya is not from the IFP paper transcripts it is from the NGMCP (Nepal German Manuscript Cataloguing Project) collectionms. no. 1-257 reel no. A-146/8 . As far as I know the only way at present to get a a photographic copy of the manuscript is to order it directly from the national archives in Katmandu. I do not know the procedure of doing that. The manuscript can also be viewed in the State Library in Berlin Germany. Though I don't know if it is permitted to make copies of it there. I have never seen the original manuscript so I don't know if the errors you speak of are in the manuscript or due to the copying.
