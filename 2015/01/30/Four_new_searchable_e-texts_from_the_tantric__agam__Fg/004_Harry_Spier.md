Dear Roydebabrata,

  

The copyrights to the photographic images of these particular
manuscripts are owned either by the Nepalese government in the case of the NGMCP manuscripts and the EFEO and IFP in the case of the EFEO/IFP manuscripts therefore Muktabodha is not allowed to reproduce or distribute these photographic images. But also by copyright law (and by agreement with the EFEO and IFP) we are allowed to type these up and distribute these typed versions via our website since the contents of the manuscripts are out of copyright (though the photographic images are not).

  

Regards,

Harry Spier

Manager Muktabodha Digital Library
