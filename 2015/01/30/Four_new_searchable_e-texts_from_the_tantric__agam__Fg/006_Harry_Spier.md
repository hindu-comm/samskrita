Scans of all the paper transcripts of the IFP/EFEO are available on the Muktabodha website digital library. It is free but requires registration. These are photographs of hand copies of the original manuscripts made in the 1950's and 1960's by a team under the direction of Dr. N. R. Bhatt. This on-line collection at the Muktabodha website ( [www.muktabodha.org](http://www.muktabodha.org) ) has the IFP/EFEO catalogue records which record the collection and catalogue number of the original manuscript.
