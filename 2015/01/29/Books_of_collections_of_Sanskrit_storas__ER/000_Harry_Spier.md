Dear list members,

  

Can any list members give me the names of books of collections of Sanskrit stotras.

Currently I have:

Bṛhatstotraratnakaraḥ (privately published)

Stotrāvalī published by Sri Aurobindo Society

Stotraratnāvalī published by Geeta Press

  

I'm looking for more good collections (large number of Stotras, all dieties. few misprints)

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
