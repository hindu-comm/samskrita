Harry,

  

Mahaperiaval Trust has published several volumes of stotra books of major deities of Hinduism. These are exhaustive collections containing stotras of respective deities from puranas, agamas and other scriptures. All books were edited and proof-read by Sri S.V. Radhakrishna Sastrigal of Tanjore who was a great Sanskrit & Vedic scholar.  

  

Giving below a list of their publications.  

  

Devi Nama Stotra Manjari 2 volumes

Some of the above books were available in pdf format at their site till a few days back - <http://srimahaperiavaltrust.com/welcome_files/Page621.html> But, now the site is down for some unknown reason.

  

All the above books can be purchased from NAMA publications - <http://namalayam.org/PDF_Files/NamaPublications.pdf>
