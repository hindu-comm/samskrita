hariH OM,  
  
1. kariiSha (gomaya) has the capability to rejuvenate utterly barren lands. Hence, to call it lakShmii is an understatement.  
  

2\. gomUtra, gomaya have been used for a long time to develop a liquid ferment called jiivAmRRita which is extremely beneficial for crops and eliminates the need for fertilizers and pesticides.  
  

3\. go is lakShmii and hence any vikaara of lakShmii should be lakShmii itself. (any number of references from tradition can be given to substantiate this, but the importance of go being pratyakSha for sustainable economies, there is no need for bookish approach here).  
  

The absurdity is only in the minds of people who think that grains drop from heavens into supermarket shelves over night. It is as though the use of the word "dung" will make gomaya less sacred. This is among the most sacred of all dravyas that bhagavaan has created.  
  
svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
