Namasthey,  
  
1.The meaning of the word ‘ करीषिणीम् ‘ I have seen somewhere  
appears to be significant :  
  
करीष = Dung (Cow dung is sacred as has been quoted by Shri V Sriram  
and Shri Shrivathsa B in their mails)  
  
करीषिणी = A region abounding in dung  
  
करीषिणीम् = A region abounding in dung signifying that She leaves a  
residue of ‘Abundance’  
  
2.However, the word करीषिणी a river is also referred in  
Mahabharata.The rivers are having a ‘continuos flow’ and are treated  
as sacred.  
  
'करीषिणीं चित्रवाहां च चित्रसेना च निम्नगाम्'।  
  
भीष्म पर्व महाभारत 9,17 में उल्लिखित
