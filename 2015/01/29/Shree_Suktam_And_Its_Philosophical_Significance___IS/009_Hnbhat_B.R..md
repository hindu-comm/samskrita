I think much has been discussed about the word etymology and its  
meaning in the previous messages according to their imagination holy  
or auspicious or absurd, and not its importance in the verse along  
with its other actiivities.  
  
I would like to add only this much. According to Sayana, the verse  
qualifies, goddess of prosperity, श्रीः, in the form of land property,  
i.e. earth, to which all the qualifications suit well.  
  
I have not read the whole of the philosophical meaning given by  
Ramesh, but read the commentary of Sayana, which is in the Srisukta,  
in the Khila portion.  
  
According to him, गन्धद्वारां दुराधर्षाम् नित्यपुष्टां करीषिणी, all  
adjectives points out to land or earthy.  
  
1. गन्ध is the property of the earth, hence it is the source of गन्ध,  
smell, good or bad. गन्धद्वारा.  
२. दुराधर्षाम् - stable or hard to destroy.  
3. नित्यपुष्टा = सस्यादिसम्पद्भरिता, रत्नगर्भा, वसुन्धरा all point out  
this fact.\\  
4. करीषिणी - शुष्कगोमयवती, it is fertile as explained in the previous  
adjective, due to having cow-dung, which is inclusive of all organic  
fertilizers, from the cattle breed and not only the cow.  
5. Hence सर्वभूतानामीश्वरी, feeding all the living beings, and ईष्वरी  
for all the living beings.  
  
Hence theश्रीः called for in this verse is the श्रीः, in the form of  
भूः, which is considered as the wealth, even it is प्रत्यक्ष as  
somebody remarked.  
  
This is the view of the commentator and I do not take the  
responsibility of the explanation myself not ascertain the correctness  
or absurdity of the use of the word as an adjective.
