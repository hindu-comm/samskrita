Namaste,

  

Why should it be considered as absurd ?

  

Are you not aware of "pancha-gavyAs" that are considered as
maNgaLa-dravyAs for shrauta & smArta karmAs.

  

gOmUtraM gOmayaM sarpiH kSIraM dadhi cha rOchanA

SaDangamEtat paramaM maNgalyaM sarvadA gavAM (viSNu samhita 23/58-59)

  

The shaDangAs viz., gO-mUtra, gO-maya, gO-ghrita, gO-dugdha, gO-dadhi and gO-rOchana are maNgaLa dravyAs which are considered most auspicious.

  

There are 5 adhiSTAna dEvatAs for pancha gavyAs namely:

  

varuNa presides over gO-mUtraM;

agni presides over gO-mayaM

chandra presides over gO-dugdhaM

vAyu presides over gO-dadhi

sUrya presides over gO-ghrita

  

So, I don't understand what is wrong in taking "karISa" as cow-dung which is used shrauta, smArta & other prAyaschitta karmAs. Moreover, it is also upa-lakSaNa for pashu-sampada.

  

regs,

sriram
