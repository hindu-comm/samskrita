mā kṛthāḥ is the negative prohibitive phrase, with the verb kR - to do.  

  

It means "Don't do" though the mood is generally used in past tense form.

  

mā kṛthās + tva seems to be the part of the next word in conjunction with the same phrase. This idiomatic phrase is found in different texts, with different verbs in classical literature.
