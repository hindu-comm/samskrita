You are right on both points Dr. Bhat. The phrase ismā sma kṛthāstvam =mā sma kṛthās tvam

  

Is kṛthās here is the 2nd personātmanepade singular optative form ?

Iskṛthās =kṛ + thās an irregular form?

nayethāḥ, dviṣīthāḥ, juhmvithāḥ, rundhīthāḥ, kurvīthāḥ, kṛīṇīthāḥ add īthāḥ notthāḥ for2nd personātmanepade singular optative form.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
