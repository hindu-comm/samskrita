Interesting discussion with examples, Dr. Bhat. Sorry for my tangential thought:  
The पूजायाम् बहुवचनम् usage must be rather infrequent early on. पाणिनि does not specifically mention this usage, does he? He only mentions that for the उत्तम and मध्यम persons, the dual and the plural can be used in reference to one person. But he does not specify respect, even for that. And we often see singular usage between servants and nobility even in medieval plays.
