अस्मदो द्वयोश्च। and the वार्तिक "युष्मदि गुरावेकेषाम्"

  

is the reference in respect first person and second person. It is not seen in Paninian grammar. But in commentaries you can see this "पूजायां बहुवचनम्" or एकस्मिन्नपि "अवयवगतबहुत्वापेक्षया वा बहुवचनम्" in respect of such usages. It is generally taken as granted, in the extended usages of Bahuvacanam in the third person. The examples are from Valmiki Ramayana, I had quoted.

  

Like the word दार used in plural and masculine, as in सीता रामस्य धर्मदाराः, or दारान् पद्मभुवस्त्रिलोकजननीम्, in which the word दार meaning a wife, which is used in masculine gender and plural, generally, but the qualification is in singular, त्रिलोकजननीम्, as per the नियतलिङ्गवचन and even the concordance is not kept in such cases.

  

Thanks for pointing out it's absence in Ashtadhyayi. It seems to be extension of the वार्तिक, "युष्मदि गुरावेकेषाम्" extended to third person also.
