Sir,

With all due respect

I know that verb depends upon the subject and according to the subject, we apply the verb form

But, here my question is different. What I want to know is that even though Hemachandra Acharya is a single person (singular form should be used), still the plural forms of the verbs आचर्यवर्या: and विरचयन्तु are used. The author is using Singular noun with a plural verb. That is the ambiguity I want to clear.  

Similarly, in the first statement, 'they say' is used for Patanjali who is singular. Please clarify

Thank You and there was no wrong intention or unnecessary reiteration on my part. My doubt was not understood at that time, therefore I put it up again. There was no bad intention on my part

Thanks
