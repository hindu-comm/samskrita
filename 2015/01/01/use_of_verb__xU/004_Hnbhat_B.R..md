You are correct in your understanding. It is the rule of concordance of subject and verb in a sentence grammatically, whether use the subject in plural or singular depending on the context and the verb for the subject should concord with the number of the subject.

Here also it is the same. The subject is in the plural and विरचयन्तु is also in plural and there is nothing wrong.

No. You are wrong. Read the sentence once again. आचार्यवर्याः is the subject and the verb also is in plural. He is not using the singular noun आचार्यवर्यः as the subject in which case it would be wrong to have plural verb.

ते is in plural and the verb also in concordance with the subject.

  

Whether he uses plural in respect or not is left to his choice.

  

The rule generally followed I had given in my first post itself, which I think you had not read and repeat your questions repeatedly.

  

"पूजायां बहुवचनम्"

  

सेयं मम सुता राजन् विश्वामित्रपुरस्सरैः ।

यदृच्छयागतैर्वीरैर्निर्जिता तव पुत्रकैः ।। 1.68.8 ।।  

  

In Valmiki Ramayana, Rama is referred to by पुरकैः, who won the bet for the marriage of Sita:

  

पुत्रकैः पूजायां बहुवचनम् । जामातृत्वाध्यवसायात् महाराजकुमारत्वाद्वा पूजा ।  

  

The above is the case for singular.

  

Here is the case of plural for two.

  

*इमान्यासनमुख्यानि आसातां मुनिपुङ्गवौ ।*

यथा दशरथस्येयं तथायोध्या पुरी मम ।  

प्रभुत्वे नास्ति सन्देहो *यथार्हं कर्तुमर्हथ ।। 1.72.16 ।।*  

  

This is the logic of usage.
