Thank you Animeshji for circulating Vymanikashastra with English translation. Like Vedic mathematics its origin is in 20th century only. Yet the manner of expressing this abstruse subject in Sanskrit and presenting it methodically as a treatise speaks volumes for the ability of the writer. If someone could bring out such a work in 20th century when facilities for dissemination of knowledge were well developed and pass it off as from Bharadwaja Muni, God only knows how many of our so called ancient works have been written by less ancient authors living in times when dissemination of knowledge was much less developed.

Regards

Murthy
