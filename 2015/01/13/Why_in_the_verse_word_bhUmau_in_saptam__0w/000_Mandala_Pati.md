This is a verse from bhāgavata purāṇa, 10.7.19  
**  
भूमौ** निधाय तं गोपी  
विस्मिता भार-पीडिता  
महा-पुरुषम् आदध्यौ  
जगताम् आस कर्मसु  
  
As I understand, भूमौ it is a karma. (Yaśodā placed Kṛṣṇa on the ground). Kṛṣṇa is an object of mother's activity. It supposed to be in dvitiya vibhakti.  
Where am I wrong? If You can refer to Panini sutra(s) it will be appreciated.  
Thanks.

 Translation (by ISKCON BBT)  
Feeling the child to be as heavy as the entire universe and therefore being anxious, thinking that perhaps the child was being attacked by some other ghost or demon, the astonished Mother Yaśodā put the child down on the ground and began to think of Nārāyaṇa. Foreseeing disturbances, she called for the brāhmaṇas to counteract this heaviness, and then she engaged in her other household affairs. She had no alternative than to remember the lotus feet of Nārāyaṇa, for she could not understand that Kṛṣṇa was the original source of everything.  
  
As I understand, भूमौ it is a karma. (Yaśodā placed Kṛṣṇa on the ground). Kṛṣṇa is an object of mother's activity. It supposed to be in dvitiya vibhakti.
