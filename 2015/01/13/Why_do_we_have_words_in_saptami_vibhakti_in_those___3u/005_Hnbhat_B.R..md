It is just a commonsense and the usage in the language. Some one can fall from heaven or the sky or fly in the sky. He can fly downwards from the sky, i.e. आकाशात् पतति, आकाशात् पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्।

  

खगः आकाशे पतति - can mean the bird flies in the sky.

It can mean it may fly in the sky or flies downwards to the earth. In the first, it takes locative, and it is not is not directed towards any destination in particular. In the second, it takes ablative case, as it denotes the departure from the sky and the destination would take either location or the destination as the case may be.

  

आकाशात् खगः भूमौ पतति - would mean The bird falls from the sky on the ground.



आकाशात् खगः भूमिं पतति - would mean the bird flies downwards to the ground.  

  

It cannot fall in a location in the sky. Anything can be located in a location and may fall down on the location itself, without any destination. That is the commonsense. Falling on the ground need not a location. Anything can be moved in a location.
