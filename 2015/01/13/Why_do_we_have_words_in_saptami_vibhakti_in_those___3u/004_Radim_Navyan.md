The doubt is in other point.  
  
What is grammatical foundation for such a cases?  
Say of (2). When राक्षसः पतति, lokus (आधारः) is आकाशः, not भूमिः \[अष्टा॰ १.४.४५\]। He falls in‍/through the atmosphere, it's evidential. The action takes place not in/at भूमिः।  
  
So, why do we have here saptami and not dvitiya?  
राक्षसः आकाशे भूमिः पतति। What's wrong with it?  
  
Hope, that's what Mandala Pati would like to ask.
