पतन and nayana are both actions, the adhikarana of kriya, actions take saptami. If they denote specifically movement from one place to another, like gramam ajaam nayati, gaganam utpatati, it would take karmavibhakti according to the vartika, gantavyo bhavo adhvaa vaa karmasamjnako bhavati.

  

His question was was why it is saptami vibhakti, and not what is the vibhakti.
