Hari!  
  
In the book "The stories of Kṛṣṇa" I read a story how Kṛṣṇa killed tṛnāvarta demon.  
But in that story in two sentences I didn't understand, why there is a saptami vibhakti.  
  
1 - kṛṣṇam gagane nayati \|  
2 - rākṣasaḥ bhūmyām patati \|  
  
gagana and bhūmi are karmas so they have to take dvitiya, isn't it?
