\(1\) Yayati falls in the sky. What vibhakti would be to "in the sky"?  
  
(2) Yayati falls from heaven in the sky. What vibhakti would be to "in the sky"?  
  
(3) Yayati falls to earth from heaven in the sky. What vibhakti would be to "earth"? And why?  
  
These are my personal questions yet, sir.  
Thanks.
