First of all thanks a lot for guiding well.Though I am asking the same shlok again because I am not getting meaning of the wordशो which is there in the shlok. Another thing is according to sandhi rule  श: + अन्तरम् = शोऽन्तरम् . then how can we take the word as शो . In shlok
अपूर्व / कान्त words have saperate meanings then there must be the saperate meaning of even शोऽन्तरम् . Please explain me in detail in english or in hindi.

  

  

अपूर्वोऽयं मया दृष्ट: कान्त: कमललोचने।

*शोऽन्तरं* यो विजानाति स विद्वान्नात्र संशय:॥

Who is speaking the first line and to whom and about whome?
