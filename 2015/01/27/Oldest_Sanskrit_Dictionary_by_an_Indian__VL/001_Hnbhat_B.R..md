Depends on your terminology you have used. Dictionary has got itw own property and lexicon has got its own property. Encyclopeadia has got its own purpose and format.

  

So Kosha, has got different forms. It is not a dictionary in the English sentence, but got a particular purpose, giving the synonyms for each word, categorized in different sections, which could be called as a Thesaurus.

  

Nighantu is a vocabulary of words used in Veda-s, by Nirukta, and in later it was used in general vocabulary with synonyms, but not in alphabetical order, like an English Dictionary.

  

Kosha also means a collection of words, but may be extended to a larger section, subsection, or paragraph on a topic also or particular subject.
