Respected scholars,  

Sorry for cross posting.  
  

I am looking for available commentaries on gaNapATha (Paninian or other grammar systems).  
  

I searched for it and could gather only gaNaratnamahodadhi.  
  

I am sure there must be some other commentaries as well. Any pointers to that regards would be welcome.
