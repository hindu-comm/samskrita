Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary shows, in its list of alphabets, the lettersल् ळ् ळ्ह् in this order, although there are no words that begin with ळ or ळ्ह. These are shows as 'sometimes forड् and ढ् in Veda'. 

  

Marathi regularly usesळ, especially when an originally Sanskrit word is adapted into Marathi as inकाल - काळ, फल - फळ, शाला - शाळा, कला - कळा, माला - माळा, वेला - वेळ.
