I am not a linguist, but let me elaborate.

  

1\) Among speakers of languages that have a ळ (Marathi and the Dravidian languages), the ल of certain Sanskrit words becomes ळ. This is not arbitrary butconsistent: a competent linguist can probably examine the data and arrive at systematic rules for exactly when the replacement happens. For example, among Kannada (and other) speakers,

मङ्गलं becomes मङ्गळं and नलिनी becomes नळिनी, butकमला neverकमळा. (Different words appear to change in different regions: in Kannada, of the Sanskrit words in Mr. Kolhatkar's list, only वेला changes to वेळा.)

  

2\) In principle one could consider these tadbhava forms I suppose, but they are not normally thought of as such. (A vague reason may be, and here I wildly speculate: tadbhava words are usually ones that are somehow "simplified" from the tatsama Sanskrit forms, e.g.राक्षस becoming रक्कस with a "simpler" conjunct consonant. But these ल ->ळ transformations are not thought of as a loss of precision; if anything they add precision about which of the two "la" forms to use.)

  

3\) As a result, even Sanskrit pandits and those well-versed in Sanskrit may often use theळ forms, even when speaking/using Sanskrit.

  

4\) In particular, stotras may be recited with the ळ form. For instance, I remember being taught in my childhood the verse "नळिनीदळगतजलमतितरळं तद्वद्जीवितमतिशयचपलम् / विद्धिव्याध्याभिमानग्रस्तं लोकं शोकहतं च समस्तम् /" where of the six "la" sounds, three of the four in the first pāda use the ळ sound. Examples abound; for instance, you can listen to"उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ गोविन्द / उत्तिष्ठ गरुडध्वज // उत्तिष्ठ कमलाकान्त / त्रैलोक्यंमङ्गळंकुरु" (twice) at 0:30 in the popular Venkateshvara Suprabhatam at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzr57yL_5fQ> If you can read the Kannada script, you can do a Google search for

  

5\) Finally to answer your question: perhaps the publication you refer to, Mantrapushpam by Ramakrishna Math, is a descriptive work that faithfully transcribes the stotras as actually/traditionally recited (in its region of publication).
