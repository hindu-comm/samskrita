Dear list members,

  

In the kanakadhārāstotram (in the mantrapushpam by Ramakrishna Math) there are a few places where the letterळ is used. A few examples are:

  

हारावळीव हरिनीलमयी विभाति।

कालाम्बुदाळि ललितोरसि कैटभारेः

  

I have seen this letterळused in Vedic texts also I've seen it described as used in Marathi. (But in the book Stotrāvalī the letterलis used throughout).Can someone tell me why this letterळis being used in a classical Sanskrit stotra. Since its used three or four times I don't think its a misprint. 

  

Thanks,

Harry
