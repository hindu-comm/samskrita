It depends on the practice of the Brahmayajna.  
  
You are the best jujdge as you seem to be a Vedioc practitioner.  
  
The phrase ekaamapi is related with Rik, and it does not mean the  
firstr of Rik, and the word for first is prathama. Even one Rik is  
recited, or one yajus etc., it completes the brahmayajhna. as it means  
generally. I am not an expert in Vedic practices.  
  
Brahma means Veda-s in general, and in this context, even though the  
whole of svadhaya could not be recited for brahmayajna, it would be  
enough to recite a single rik, representing the whold samhita, brahma,  
of his shakha or caturveda. In practice it is the first of every Veda,  
vedanga, (six) is recited for convenience.
