Hello,  
  
I am having a hard time matching manuscripts. I am reading Kalidasa's Abhijñānaśākuntalam, and I really like the scene where the asetic tells the King to lower his bow and not kill the antelope. (Act 1, section 10)  

  

But I'm looking in three different sources, but they don't seem to match. Source 1 and 2 agree, but source 3, which is supposedly a scholarly critical edition, seems to be missing lines.

  

[Source 1](https://archive.org/stream/sakuntalasanskri00kaliiala#page/13/mode/1up), Sanskrit in older Deva-nagari.

  

[Source 2](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/3_drama/ksakunxu.htm), Sanskrit in Latin characters. (Scroll down to "KSak_1.10:")

  

[Source 3,](https://books.google.com/books?id=RHyC5yOMo90C&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Recognition%20of%20Sakuntala&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q=The%20Recognition%20of%20Sakuntala&f=false) English and Sanskrit on facing pages.

  

Which one of these is the "real" play? I would like to read the Sanskit of these lines with a very literal translation into English. I am a beginner in Sanskrit--actually less than a beginner--but I am interested in Kalidasa.

  

Thank you!
