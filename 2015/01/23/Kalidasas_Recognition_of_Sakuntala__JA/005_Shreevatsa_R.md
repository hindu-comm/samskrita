Source 1, as it says on the [title page](https://archive.org/stream/sakuntalasanskri00kaliiala#page/n5/mode/2up), is based on the "Devanagari" recension of the text.

Source 2, as it says at the top, is "Based on the edition by M.R. Kale, Bombay 1898", which too is [based](https://books.google.com/books?id=mE_Zvd6zWFwC&pg=PP8) on the Devanagari recension.

Source 3, as it says [in the introduction](https://books.google.com/books?id=RHyC5yOMo90C&pg=PA37), is based on the Kashmirian recension, even though it acknowledges that the Devanagari recension is probably the most popular one.

  

The differences are minor.
