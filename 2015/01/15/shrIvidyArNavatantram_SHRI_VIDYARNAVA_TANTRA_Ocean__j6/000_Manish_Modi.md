Each religion focuses on two benefits - shreya {spiritual upliftment} and preya {temporal well-being}. The Vedic religion is no exception to this. Certain forms of Upanishadic belief holds that spiritual uplift may only be achieved by attaining oneness with the supreme soul. This oneness may be attained either with the nirguna {without epithets} or the saguna {with virtues} manifestations of the supreme deity.

  

Since the nirguna manifestation is extremely difficult to conceive, the saguna form is worshiped in the path of Tantra-shastra or the Agamas. Whereas the Agamas worship the male aspect of the supreme deity (Shiva), the Tantras worship both aspects - the male (Shiva) and the female (Shakti).

  

The female godhead is known as the Maha-Tripura-Sundari {Exalted Mistress of the Three Worlds}. She is seen as the female counterpart of the male trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha. She is said to be personified by three goddesses - Maha-Sarasvati, Maha-Lakshmi, Maha-Kali.

  

The present work is a collection of texts that deal with the worship of Maha-Tripura-Sundari. Each verse is presented in Sanskrit with an accurate Hindi translation and appropriate explanation in Hindi. A 92 page introduction serves as a complete guide to Tantra-shastra.

  

This work is a tour-de-force. The original text is a classic work by the medieval seer, Yati Vidyaranya. And the Hindi translation is excellent. The book is impeccably produced and would grace the most prestigious bookshelves. We are proud to sell this beautifully printed and bound set of books.
