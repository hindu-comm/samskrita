Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Makara Sankranti** falls on **15-Jan-2015 (Thursday)**, I am happy to share a rare **Ashtottaram** on **Lord Surya** titled **Keshavaditya Ashtottaram** taken from **Skanda Puranam**, **Avanti Khanda, Chapter 44**. This hymn appears as **Keshavaditya Mahatmyam** and is presumably created by **Lord Vishnu**.

  

As we have seen in the last few years, **Lord Surya** worship is given a prominent status within **Sanatana Dharma** - regardless of the sub-sects and secondary leanings. Lord Surya is just another manifestation of the one and only Brahman as is explained by **Sage Agastya** to **Lord Rama** in **Aditya Hrudayam** in **Valmiki Ramayana**.

  

Lord Surya is sometimes alluded to as **Lord Narayana** and sometimes as **Lord Rudra**. A few years ago, I had shared a rare **Surya Hrudayam** from **Kurma Puranam** where Lord Surya is prayed as **Lord Rudra** Himself. In the attached hymn too this plurality is driven home eloquently - **viShNuM, ahirbudhnyaM, hara-netraM, Madhya-dine-rudraM, dina-xaye-shyAmaM viShNum,** etc. In **Surya Stavaraja Stotram** in **Brahma Vaivarta Puranam** Lord Surya is prayed as **brahma-Vishnu-maheshAnAM-aMshaM** (manifestation of Brahma/Vishnu/Shva).

  

We have also seen (last year) that **Sage Vyasa** mentions that there is no God beyond Aditya in **Bhavishya Purana**and there is no refuge than him.Since such superlatives are given for each and every deity form in various puranas, it all converges to the point that the Brahman manifests in different forms for our own benefit and therefore there is no need to cook up a **Gartner Magic Quadrant on Divinity** -that's absolute bunkum and ineptitude :)

  

May We Pray To Lord Surya On The **Makara Sanktranti** day with this rare **Keshavaditya Ashtottaram. Wishing You All a Very Happy Pongal!**

  

(Note : I am not quite sure about a couple of names in the stotra as the print is feeble)
