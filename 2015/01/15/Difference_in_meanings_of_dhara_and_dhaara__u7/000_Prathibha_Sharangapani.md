Respected members,

  

I am a beginner in learning sanskrit. I have some basic doubts regarding the use of dhara and dhaara. Do they both mean 'wear"? If so is 'sUtradhara' same as 'sUtradhaara'? But I have never heard anybody using the word 'giridhara' and 'giridhaara' interchangeably.

  

Please help me!

  

Thanks

Prathibha
