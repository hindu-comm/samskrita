Prathibha,

  

"doubts regarding the use of dhara and dhaara"

  

Use. By whom?

  

  

"Do they both mean 'wear'"

  

Bothwords?

  

There are at least three dhaara's ...

  

Surely you are able to resolve your doubts yourself, byavailing yourself of a dictionary.

  

e.g.

**sūtra**-**dhara**  
• *mfn.* wearing a string of (*comp.*), *MBh.*  
• *m.* one versed in the *Sūtras*, *L.* = next, *L.* \[1242,1\]

**sūtra**-**dhāra**  
• *m.* 'rule or thread-holder', an architect, carpenter, *MBh. VarBṛS.*  
• a stage-manager (or principal actor who superintends the whole performance; *accord.* to some he was originally so called from holding the strings of puppets.  
• his assistants are the *pāripārśvika* and *sthāpaka*, qq. vv.), *Bhar. Sāh. &c.*  
• N. of Indra, *L.*  
• *(ī)*, *f.* the wife of a stagemanager (also called *gṛhiṇī*), *Mṛcch. Mudr.*  
• *mf(ī*)*n.* being the chief or leading person at any performance (*comp.*), *Bālar.*  
• *-maṇḍana m.* (also simply called *Maṇḍana*) N. of an author (son of *Śrīkṣetra* and client of *Kumbha-karṇa*, king of *Medapāṭa*) *Cat.* \[1242,1\]
