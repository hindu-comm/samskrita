Perhaps in my humble opinion, these are two verbs  
  

धर = धरणं करोति इति ,  
  

As per the legendary story Lord Krishna lifted Govardhan mountain to protect the people . Therefore, he is called Goovardhan giridhaari  
  

गोवर्धन = the Mountain , गिरि = mountain धर = one who holds  

and धारा i e = dhaara = is like a flow , thread or strings which connect  
  

I am not a scholar, i may be wrong, request to correct my understanding  
  

regards
