The lover is pleading with the beloved who is feigning anger or disenchantment.

  

"प्रणामान्तो मानस्तदपि न जहासि क्रुधमहो। Pride vanishes after the offender has asked for forgiveness, yet you do not give up your anger."  
"स्तनप्रत्यासत्या हृदयमपि ते चण्डि। कठिनम्॥ O harsh woman, your heart, too, is hard as it is close to your breast." (Firmness of breast is a compliment.)
