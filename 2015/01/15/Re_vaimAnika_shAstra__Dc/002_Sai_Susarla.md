Just curious. Does the approach presented in this work have any original ideas not explored elsewhere? And does it work?  

If yes, from a science perspective why does it matter whether it was written in 19th century AD or BC ? Other than for either chest-beating or proving our ancients were truly ignoramuses w.r.t. material nature as we firmly want to believe?  
  

Let's say, a modern author wants to repudiate the credit to some ancient person, because either (a) he felt inspired by the ancient or (b) otherwise people won't even read his work. What is our problem there as readers?
