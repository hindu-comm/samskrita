I agree with Sri.Sai Susarla that readers should not have any problem in reading what is being presented as a text.

When a work is presented to us as being that of Bhardwaja Muni, the question of who this Bharadwaja Muni is comes up. He has to be a Muni belonging to Bharadwaja Gotra. Did he live in 20th century or a distant past? Such questions are never asked by Sanskrit traditionalists because , as is well known, traditionalists do not believe in historical research. For them past is just an amalgam of incidents and events. It does not matter to them who lived when and who came first and who came later.

Now coming to the point of what this vaimanika shastra contains, a group of engineers and scientists has already passed an opinion that the models presented are aerodynamicaly meaningless and impractical.

Perhaps the text is at best a masterly fake in the sense that it imitates well how an ancient would have written such a technical text.
