Dear list members,

  

A have seen a translation of -  bhaumāvāsyāniśābhāge pūjayitvā - as "having worshipped on the new moon night when it falls on a Tuesday" but I'm not clear why "new moon" is included as part of this translation?

  

Does the phrase bhaumāvāsyāniśābhāge pūjayitvā mean "having worshipped on the new moon night when it falls on a Tuesday" or does it mean something like:

"Having worshipped on part of the night of Tuesday" .

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
