Thank you Dr. Bhatt and G S S Murthy I checked two editions, the reading isbhaumāvāsyāniśābhāgepūjayitvā notbhaumāmāvāsyāniśābhāgepūjayitvā .

  

Could it be a kind of "word-play" where the Tantric text doesn't say the time of worship "explicitly" but hints at it by the phrase that sounds almost like (but isn't) bhaumāmāvāsyāniśābhāgepūjayitvā  

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
