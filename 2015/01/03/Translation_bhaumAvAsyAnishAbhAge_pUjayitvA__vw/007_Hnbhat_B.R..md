Tantrik texts usually have grammatical aberrations in many cases. The meaning is deduced by the context and the practice, even though it doesn't form a good grammatical word. so you can rely on the translation as correct without worrying about the correct form.

  

WE used to joke, if a grammarian is put to work on Agama texts, he would become a non-grammarian, after working in Tantra and Agama texts.
