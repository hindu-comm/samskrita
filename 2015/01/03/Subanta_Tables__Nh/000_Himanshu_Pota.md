Please find attached a document with 213 subanta tables. The essential Panini sutras to get the subanta tables are also included. The word index is linked to the subanta tables in the document and the sutras are linked to the corresponding sutras at the avg-sanskrit site.

  

I have used XeLaTeX to create the pdf with unicode Devanagari .tex file. If you need those files please let me know.

  

This might be useful for beginners like myself.

  

Thanks.

  

Himanshu
