A downloadable copy is available at<https://www.scribd.com/doc/75830337/Samarangana-Sutradhara>.
Someone has uploaded from another site where the original is available.
I took it from that site but am unable to locate it again. The book has become quite popular these days among 'Vastu' enthusiasts and the place where I got it from was connected with the modern 'Vastushastra.

  

A warning here. The above copy has several errors in it. For an accurate text, you should go to T.Ganapatishasti's edition of 1926, published in 2 volumes in under the auspices of the Baroda State. DLI has it at several places and that is where I got it. If you are lucky - because getting anything from DLI needs luck above anything else! - you might succeed in downloading T.Ganapatishastri's edition from there.
