I appreciate your posts on Vedic texts. But I urge you to mention your sources also. I am interested in knowing whether your Graheshti Brahmana is based on

  
*Kāthaka-samkalana*, Edited with notes by Sūryakānta, Lahore 1943; (ML Publns. N.Delhi,1981). Or do you have some other independent source?
