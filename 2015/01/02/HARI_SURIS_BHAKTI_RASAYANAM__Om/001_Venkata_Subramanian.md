Further to my earlier post, I would like to add that if पूर्वजवल्लभा: सुमहिलास्ताश्चात्र has to be interpreted as पूर्वजस्य वल्लभा ता: ( meaning the wives of the elder brother- Balarama) it does not fit well as Balarama's wife was Revathi only and there is no mention of his other wives in the Purana.

Further as per Vaishnavite belief , his other wife was Vaaruni and this also does not fit.

If पूर्वजानां वल्लभा:दिव्य पितृगणा: तत् पर्याय: पितर:- is interpreted as fore-fathers which includes Vasudeva -the father also.

Vasudeva had 13 wives-viz. Rohini, Pauravi, Madira,Bhadra, Rochana, Ila, Dhrutadeva, Shantideva, Upadeva, Shrideva, Devarakshatha, Sahadeva, and Devaki also.

Is it the intention of the poet Harisuri to say that all of them got सत्पुत्रा: - because of Krishna's birth in “रोहिणी “नक्षत्र ? Did not they have children earlier to Krishna,s birth ?

It is correct to say that कृष्ण chose “रोहिणी “नक्षत्र as His birth star and this will obviate any feeling ofसापत्न्यकं ., as Balarama was born to Rohini.

It is also logical thatकृष्ण preferred दक्षिनायन अष्टमी as this period is the night for पितृलोक. This explains His having born in the mid-night as the poet mentions in the last quarter of the verse.

This is Hari Suri's commentary for the verse:

दशम स्कन्ध -अध्याय ३- श्लोक ८

  

निशीथे तम उद्भूते जायमाने जनार्दने ।

देवक्यां देवरूपिण्यां विष्णु: सर्वगुहाशय: ।

आविरासीत् यथा प्राच्यां दिशीन्दुरिव पुष्कल: ॥

श्री हरि सूरि श्रीभक्ति रसायनं

Will the scholars help me in understanding the intention of the poet?
