Dharma Jagrthi Trust(R), Bengaluru is organizing their third annual conference "Arsha Dhara"

  

This year DJT is organizing a three day international conference on "Influence of Vedas on World Sciences & Culture" at Mythic Society, Nrupatunga Road, Bengaluru from 30th January 2015 - 1st February 2015.

  

The conference will cover a wide range of topics from the history and evolution of science and technologyworldwide, cultural & philosophical thoughts world wide and how the vedas influenced the above two streams. Along with that the conference will cover the evolution of the so called developedmodern times, plethora of problems,issues and environmental disasters that emerged in recent times with an intention of finding solutions by following the time tested vedic way of life and ideals.

  

Arsha dhara 3 is a step forward in the direction of "*alparambham bruhatparinamam"*to achieve the above said goal.

  

We request one and all to make the best use of the conference by participating, learning and sharing one's knowledge and experience in the vedic ideals.
