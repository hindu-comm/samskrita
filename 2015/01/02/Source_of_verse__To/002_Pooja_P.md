Thank you Sir for the link.  
  
The source is indicated as the Vartikakara of Sri Bhagavatpada. As in one of the comments about a tika of Anandagiri, I searched in the Bhashya Vartikas available on the internet which have Anandagiri Tikas (with the pdfs available from sanskritebooks) but wasn't able to find where it has been said by the Vartikakara. Hence this post on the forum to find out where the Vartikakara has said this about SriBhagavatpada.
