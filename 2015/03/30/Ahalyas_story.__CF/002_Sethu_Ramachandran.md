Once in his discourse,Sri.Nochur Venkatarama anna,

said that Baghawan Sri Ramanar explained this taht

it is not actually curse turning Ahalya a stone but she had to

remain unseen by anybody and it was a SPIRITUAL STAGNATION AND

SHE WOULD SPIRITUALLY GET OUT OF THIS STAGNATION,

WHEN RAMA ENTERS THE AREA.
