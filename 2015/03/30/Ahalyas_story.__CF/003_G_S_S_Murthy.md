There are similar discrepancies between the popular version and the Valmiki version. Lakshman rekha is not there in Valmiki. Shabari giving to Rama fruits after herself having a bite of them is not there. Hanuman sitting at a higher height by sitting on his coiled tail in Ravana's assembly is not there.Poets after Valmiki took liberties with the story. How much of liberty Valmiki himself took with the story is anybody's guess.
