Sirs,

  

The following is mentioned in the ‘meaning or commentary to Kambaramayana’ published in <http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/l3100/l3100pd3.jsp?bookid=56&auth_pub_id=69&pno=91>

The names are printed in Tamil script; mistakes in transliteration, particularly vargadosha, are mine.



This commentary lists about 40 or more Ramayanas in different languages, besides ‘natakas’ by Bhasa, Bhavabhuti, Jayadeva etc .



This work has analyzed the presentation of the Ahalya episode by various authors under four heads: 1) Those that mention and that which do not refer to the episode at all. 2) Those kavyas which introduce the episode before Sapa vimochana, and those that introduce it after sapa vimochana. 3) Those that mention that Ahalya was aware of \[or the interloper was\] Indra and those according to whom she was not aware and 4) Differences in Sapa vimochana.



Valmiki, Raghuvamsa (of Kalidasa) Narasimhapuranam, Kambaramayana \[Tamil\], Telugu Ramayanas, Kannada Torave Ramayana, Ezhuthachan \[Malayalam\] Ramayanam, Tulasi Das Ramayana \[in Hindi/ Vraj\] and Tamil Folk songs mention Ahalya episode.  Dasaatha Jataka, Bauma Charita of Vimala Suri, Vasudeva hindi, Gunabhadra’s \[Jain\] Uttara Ramayana and Kannada Pampa Ramayana completely omit the episode. This introduction to the commentary gives as a surmise the possible reason for such omission by Jaina and Buddhist literatures.



Tulasi Ramayana and Tamil Folk songs mention only the curse on Ahalya without mentioning the cause.



The commentary states that Valmiki, all three Telugu Ramayanas, the Torave Ramayana, Ezhuthachan’s \[malayala\] Ramayana state that Ahalya was aware of the identity of Indra when he stealthily entered, extended hospitality, satisfied him and satisfied herself. But Kamba says, she mistook the intruder to be her husband Gautama when she received him and offered hospitality; but during the ‘union’ Ahalya realized that it was Indra, and proceeded with ‘consent’. The commentary analyses every word of description of Kamba with that of Valmiki and concludes says Kamban mitigates the offence of Ahalya. The commentary further states that Vatsyayana has mentioned the Ahalya episode as an instance in support of his view about the inherent nature of women.



The next statement of the commentator is not understandable to me: “When the word *vayupaksha* is there *nirahara* appears redundant. Due to this and due to the additional statement ‘in the form of stone’ \[petrified\] - - - gives the impression that Kamban’s views have become Valmiki’s version”!!!



Valmiki Ramayana and Telugu Kannada Versions based on Valmiki mention the Sapavimochana to Indrat. Except in one or two recensions, the Sapavimochana to Indra is not mentioned in Kambaramayana. The Kamban ‘Society’ considers the mention as an interpolation. Tulasi is also silent about the ‘modified’ Sapa to Indra.



*All* versions of Valmiki Ramayana state that as soon as Rama and others entered *Gautama vana*, Ahalya was transformed to human form and was visible to them. No recension of Valmiki Ramayana \[not even those South Indian recensions of Valmiki Ramayana which state that Ahalya was turned to stone\] states that on Lord Rama’s dust from the feet fell on Ahalya who was in the form of a stone, she was transformed to human form.
