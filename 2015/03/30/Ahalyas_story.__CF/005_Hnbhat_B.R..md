Good analysis. Rama could not enter the तपोवन without keeping his feet on the ground and this entails the poetic imagination, on the Ahalya was turned into a शिला as reconciled by the commentators, with Padmapurana. Anyhow, it was an established fact by the time of Tulasidasa, that she was turned into a stone, from other Puranic sources, which is surmised by the nature of the curse. as described by Valmiki:

  

  

वायुभक्षा निराहारा तप्यन्ती भस्मशायिनी।।१.४८.३०

अदृश्या सर्वभूतानां आश्रमेऽस्मिन्निवत्स्यसि।

  

and also the commentators were aware of it.
