Further formatting changes to make entries more legible (in dictionaries using devanAgarI headwords onlyavailable in the<https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/dictionaries>project):

\* Use proper daNDa and double daNDa (with a newline) in place of '.' and '..' in kalpadruma and vAchaspatyam.

\* Add new lines at appropriate places in shabdasAgara.

  

(New readability errors were introduced as a result of the above- hopefully they should be minor in comparison.)

  

Users may want to update your dictionary files (eg: using the updater app, if they have atleast Android 5.x).
