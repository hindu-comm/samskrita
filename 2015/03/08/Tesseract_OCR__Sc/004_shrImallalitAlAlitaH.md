Actually, I pointed to Tesseract after finding that Oliver's OCR works very good with Sanskrit texts, but costs too much.  

Also, it is closed source, so we can't improve/change it.  

It reads a single language.  

It's UI stops you from doing many things, which we wish to do to increase speed and usability.
