Dear All,  
  
Even if we train Tessrect for the Indian Languages (Hindi, Sanskrit, etc), the quality of output can not be guaranteed. I have done some POC with Tessrect for English, Hindi and Sanskrit language and the output quality varies greatly with page to page (scan quality, font used, etc). So lets say we extract 70% of the scanned text from an eBook using tessrect, how will it be useful to the audience without requiring manual corrections ?  
Are you looking for just search level capability in the scanned books with OCR ? if you want to make it editable, selectable PDF then it will be very tough without manual intervention.  
  
I am attaching Tessrect output for Hindi, Sanskrit and English scanned pages with this email for your review. For now i don't know how to use this OCR text along with original image to make it searchable PDF.  
  
regards,  
Munish
