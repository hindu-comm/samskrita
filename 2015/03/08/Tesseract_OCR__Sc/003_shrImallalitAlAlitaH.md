This is common problem for all OCR.  

The output depends on may things, fonts, quality of scan, etc.  

ABBY Fine Reader, Oliver's Sanskrit OCR - all have training mode, similar to Tesseract.  

So, all need to train to give 90-95% correctness. Training increase correctness for OCR-s.

Actually, with English and Hindi, the performance is quite fine.  

The problem lies with Sanskrit. It appears as if it is trying to make sense of words as if they were in Hindi or some other language!!??

Manual correction is needed for all OCR texts. It's accepted.  

There is no replacement for careful editing by human.  

So, the idea is to OCR texts with more correctness(which comes from font training) and put it online(Wiki) etc. for editing by volunteers.

We need search capability. We need editable text for future commentaries, etc.  

We need to reprint our old books. That need typesetting which will be replaced by OCR-ing. Proofreading will come next. And, we will get reprints with less effort.

Accepted. We are ready for that.

Thanks.  

Sanskrit is horrible!!  

Others are good compared to that.

That's not a problem.  

If you could improve OCR with Sanskrit and font, please do it.  

Rest depends on editors and proof readers.  
  

Help in any way you could. That is enough.
