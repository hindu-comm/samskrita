Have you tried the Oliver's software locally on your machine ? Can you try converting few pages locally and forward it.  

Also i can see this comment on their website -  
"[Dec. 4th, 2014](http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php?content=news_20141204): Call for application: Free licenses of SanskritOCR for the preservation of Sanskrit literature"  
  

regards,  

Munish
