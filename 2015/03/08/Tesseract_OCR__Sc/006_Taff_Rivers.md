श्रीमल्ललितालालितः

  

  

Yes, both of Dr Oliver's OCR's (the free one and the commercial) has been availablefor some years.

  

Of course,a pdf document is not necessarilya text document, it can consist entirely of animage as would be given as the input -to-OCR software.

  

  

This following site, introduced just last November enablesdirect searching oforiginal of Sanskrit texts, i.e. *ofthe high res. digital scans themselves*.

It's an interface, where all that OCR + manual labour has already been done.

  

This work, the digitising of authenticpalm leaves or papersources, only requires doing the once, and after peer review bySanskrit professionals, placed in the public domain.

  

Try it.

  


[*http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/sanskrit-scans/query.php*](http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/sanskrit-scans/query.php)

  

Enter a word or part word, viz. \|Veda\|, and a list ofpages from the database, containing such 'word' is returned.

  

Click on one such entryand the scanned -image- of the Devanagari source is displayed with the requested word highlighted.

  



  

The textual pdf's are there, behind the scenes.

To do it yourself, there is no getting away fromthe expenditure ofa little utsāha, but the technology is already available.
