This is an OCR which was developed by HP labs, and is now with Google.  

It works fine, as we could see that google results show many results in GoogleBooks and even scans uploaded to your GoogleDrive.  

It is open source.  

It is now able to read many Indian languages.  

It can be taught new fonts.  

If anyone is able to work on this, please at least train it to recognize sanskrit (or fonts!!??).  
  

Here are few links :

Here you could find GUI:

Here was an effort based on it to identify Indian Languages:

If any programer/enthusiast is able to develop it, please go for it. It will benefit sanskrit/indian languages.  

  
  

Here is a Vietnamese OCR based on same which works for others too:

Here is a tool to train:
