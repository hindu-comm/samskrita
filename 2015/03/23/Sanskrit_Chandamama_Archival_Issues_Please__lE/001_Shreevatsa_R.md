Quite coincidentally, just today I was noticing that two issues are online:

  

1\. Just 5 days ago, someone has uploaded the July 2012 issue to the Internet Archive: <https://archive.org/details/Chandamama0712_Sanskrit>

  

2\. The August 1996 issue is available as a set of photos here: <https://plus.google.com/+SamskritaVahini/posts/9XoVoT35ydZ>

  

I really hope more issues become available!
