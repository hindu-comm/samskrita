Srikanth,

  

It is possible to edit or delete one's uploads, or add new files to an existing page at [archive.org](http://archive.org). You have to login to [archive.org](http://archive.org) for this.

I think while uploading 1989, my internet connection went down and had to resume and start over the download later.

May be thats why you see 2 pdf files.

  

I dont seem to have any control over the uploads I did after they are available publicly.

I cant even able to add a few more tags to those files. There are no options I could find so I can clean up.

  

I left it as long as its available publicly.
