Hello SriKanth,

  

Actually, I went through all the files, and I found that in many PDFs, it shows as 150+ pages. The first 70 pages or so are blank, but then after that, the entire magazine is displayed properly. I got mislead when I skipped through the first 20+ pages, which were completely blank.

  

So, Thanks again, and hope this helps others who get confused!

  

Cheers,

Bharat
