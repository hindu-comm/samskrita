I have both jpeg images and PDF. I spent few nights to convert all the jpeg files into one PDF per month.

  

I don't know about the copyright stuff, although the Chandamama was owned by a company Geodesic and that company was closed by court for financial problems.

  

I will upload to [archive.org](http://archive.org) but it will take some days as its more than 4GB.

  

Meantime, I am more than happy to share, if you are in Bangalore, please email me.
