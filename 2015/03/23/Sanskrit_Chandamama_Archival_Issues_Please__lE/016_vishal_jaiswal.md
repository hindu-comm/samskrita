If it is not too time consuming, it would be nice if the original  
jpegs are also uploaded as zip/rar files. PDF format is convenient,  
but nowadays most software has the option to directly read the jpegs  
from zip/rar files.  
I am not an expert, but I wonder if there was any loss of image  
quality while converting the jpegs into pdf.
