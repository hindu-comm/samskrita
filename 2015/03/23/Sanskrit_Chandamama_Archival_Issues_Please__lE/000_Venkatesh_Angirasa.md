Folks,

  

Wondering if anyone of you kind souls have downloaded the archives of Sanskrit Chandamama, and would be willing to share the PDFs (or whatever format). The magazine is defunct for all practical purposes, and none of the website or telephone numbers work, as you may know. CDs of archival issues of English/Telugu are floating around on ebay, but alas none Sanskrit.

  

Any other suggestions would be most welcome.  
  

Ths/Venkatesh
