Please note the following points and tips:  
  

1\. There may be copyright problems in distributing / serving thee copies out in the open.  

2\. However, if you want to share among a limited close circle, there is a much better way:  
  

a\. Open a new Gmail account. (each new one has a 15 GB capacity).  

b\. Create a Folder within the Google Drive from this account. You may also create subfolders within this per issue or per year..  

c\. Upload the contents to these folders in Google Drive (while logged in as this new Gmail ID).  

d\. After this, share this folder / folders to any number of known persons. Keep the access as "Viewers" (Not editors), that was not one person will know with whom else these docs are shared.  

e\. Avoid publicly accessible URLs.  
  

I have kept a few terrabytes of my personal data in this way using a multitude of Ids (each one pertaining to a particular topic / subject). It is also easy for searching within the content of this, once they are all shared to your real original ID. In the GMail search box itself, you can use search terms. This is even much more efficient than searching the local folders within your computer. \[You can search for 'text' even within the contents, not just by the file names).  
  

3\. Please consider me too, when you share. I too am quite eager to get them! :)
