After I login I go to the "My Library". I see Uploads, Posts and Collections. None of the three sections have all my uploaded items.

Strangely it shows only Chandamama 1988, 1989, 1990 and I get Edit option only on these.

  

For other uploads like 1984-1987, I myself do a search in [archive.org](http://archive.org) and see the files are available or not. In these files I don't get Edit option. I am using only one user id for uploading all these.
