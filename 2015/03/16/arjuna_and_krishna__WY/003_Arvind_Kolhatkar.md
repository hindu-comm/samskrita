I cannot immediately locate any authority but remember to have read that Arjuna's loss of prowess was the result of the Kaliyuga having set in after Krishna's demise. Wild Abhira tribes that dwelt in the area between Dwaraka and Hastinapura rose in revolt and drove away the cows and cattle from Dwarka. Arjuna tried to oppose them but was defeated.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
