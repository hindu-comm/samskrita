This is the reference to Mahabharata, given in the Puranic Encyclopeadia:

  

31\) Pāṇḍavas' journey to the other world. Now, it was

time for the Pāṇḍavas to journey to the other world. \[Page054-a+ 65\]


It was at this juncture that the Yādava dynasty ended

and Śrī Kṛṣṇa was killed, and some of Kṛṣṇa's con-

sorts were abducted. Arjuna could not save them, and

they jumped into the river and died. Arjuna, who lost

all his power began the great journey with his brothers.

On their way Agnideva advised him to deposit reputed

bow, Gāṇḍīva in the sea, and Arjuna did so. (Mahā-

prasthāna Parva, Chapter 1, Verses 1-42)

  

The highlighted portion is in the Mausalaparva 8. Please see this link:

60 sa śarakṣayam āsādya duḥkhaśokasamāhataḥ

dhanuṣkoṭyā tadā dasyūn avadhīt pākaśāsaniḥ

61 prekṣatas tv eva pārthasya vṛṣṇyandhakavarastriyaḥ

jagmur ādāya te mlecchāḥ samantāj janamejaya
