Respected Scholars,

  

In the Sankara Bhashya of Vishnusahasranama, Sri Sankaracharya quotes the following for explaining the name of the Lord कुन्द: \[809\]

सर्वपापविशुद्ध्यर्थं वाजिमेधेन चेष्टवान् ।

तस्मिन् यज्ञे महादाने दक्षिणां भृगुनन्दन: ।।

**मारीचाय** ददौ प्रीत: कश्यपाय वसुंधराम् ॥

इति हरिवंशे (३१.१०६)

The Translator \[Sri Ananthakrishna Sastry\] renders it as:

The Harivamsa (31.106) says: The son of Bhrigu, in order to purge all his sins, performed the Horse Sacrifice. In that sacrifice which required great gifts to be given away, He, in His incarnation as the son of Bhrigu, made a gift of the earth to Maricha with great pleasure.'

I do not comprehend whom Harivamsa refers to as Marica in the above verse.

I would be thankful to scholars throwing light for my better understanding.

With respects

R Subrahmanian
