Namaskara

Does anyone have any information on a particular type of dandaka called the Matta-matanga-lilakara?

  

It consists of four padas which each start with two na-ganas (u u u) and then an unfixed amount of ra-ganas (- u -).

  

I came across it with reference to the Shyamala Dandaka which falls into this category - although the Shyamala Dandaka has five padas rather than four. I am wondering if the Shyamala Dandaka itself gave the name to the dandaka sub-category - as Shyamala in this poem is referred to as Matangi, as she is the daughter of the sage Matanga.

  

I would also be grateful if anyone could tell me of any other dandakas that fall into this category.

  

Thank you in advance.
