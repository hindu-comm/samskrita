Two other examples of derived verbs from popular literature:

  

यत्र विद्वज्जनो नास्ति श्लाघ्यस्तत्राल्पधीरपि।

निरस्तपादपे देशे एरण्डोऽपि द्रुमायते॥

  

In the absence of the learned, even a dimwit gets notice. The EraNDa is called a tree in a country from where all trees have disappeared.
(EraNDaएरण्ड, Ricinus communis is a tropical plant. It is commonly known as the Castor plant and yields castor oil. This oil has many medicinal and industrial uses.)

  

गुणैरुत्तमतां याति नोच्चैरासनसंस्थित:।

प्रासादशिखरस्थोऽपि काको न गरुडायते॥
