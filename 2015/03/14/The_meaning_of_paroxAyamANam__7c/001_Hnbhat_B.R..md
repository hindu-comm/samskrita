It is not so hard. There are many derived verbs from verbs like that in the 10th class and also from nouns with suffixes, like णिच् in the 10th class, than listed in 10 class.

  

These are called "सनाद्यन्ता धातवः" like the dessiderative ones. there is one कण्ड्वादि class also comprising both nouns and verbs listed togather. Now, the verbs used derived using these suffixes from nouns, are called नामधातु-s verbs derived from nominal stems. These suffixes are counted as 12 intotal, the णिच् used in the 10th class used in प्रेरण.

  

"सन्क्यच्काम्यच्क्यङ्क्यषोऽथाचारक्विब्णिज्यङौ तथा।

यगाय ईयङ् णिङ् चेति द्वादशाऽमी सनादयः" इति।  

  

Here it is the suffix क्यङ् affixed to the noun परोक्ष+क्यङ् - in its final form, becomes परोक्षाय+personal endings in आत्मनेपद. as perकर्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च ३।१।११\| acting like परोक्ष (indirect or invisible to the eyes, or senses broadly)

  

परोक्षायते = परोक्ष इवाचरति। now like the present participle for the आत्मनेपद verb वर्तते - वर्तमानः, here also this takes मान - परोक्षाय+मान - परोक्षायमाणम् in the neuter gender nominative case singular, adjective for ब्रह्म in the neuter gender.

  

This is simple decomposition of the word you have asked. It will be lengthy process, to illustrate all the twelve verb forming suffixes listed there in the verse.
