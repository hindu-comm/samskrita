I've finished translation of 6th chapter of Abhinavagupta's Gitartha-sangraha. But there is one die hard word, I'm unable to understand.

Here is the whole quote (glossa to gita 6:34)

  

भगवद्–अभिहित–अनन्तर–उपाय–परंपरया स्फुटम् अपि, प्रत्यक्ष–निर्दिष्टम् अपि ब्रह्म, मनसः चाञ्चल्य–दौरात्म्यात् सुदूरे वर्तते, इति **परोक्षायमाणम्**।

  

B.Marjanovich translates परोक्षायमाणम् throug «as good as invisible». S.Shankaranarayana - through«It behaves as if It is beyond perception». But I can't make even vibhaga to it.

Taking in consideration the +माण pratyaya, it must be present participle. Tried to decompose as परोक्ष–आयमाणम्, but couldn't find dhatu, which may give our form आयमाण॰। E.g. I tried dhatu ए (आ+इ)‍‍‍‍, but it gives us आयान and ईयमान...  

  

Any hints?
