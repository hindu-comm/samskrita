Only 10th conjugational class is called चुरादिः, which prescribes verbformation from the vebs listed with a suffix णिच्. in addition to some nouns also in the same sUtra:\\

सत्याप-पाश-रूप-वीणा-तूल-श्लोक-सेना-लोम-त्वच-वर्म-वर्ण-चूर्ण-चुरादिभ्यो णिच् ३।१।२५॥  

  

Only the verbs referred to in the सूत्र above, are dealt with in*चुरादि* in the 10th class, while, the other nouns prefixed to the चुरादि, in the above, are nouns and considered as नामधातु, and they are not considered belonging to चुरादि, which derives from the verbs, with the simple basic meaning, affixed to the verbs listed in the class. But in the other, they are णिच्, in Causative Verbs are formed with any verb, in the Causative sense, which are considered as special case. हेतुमण्णिच्, प्रेरणार्थकणिच्.

The nouns listed also take different special meaning from each of the words सत्य- पाश, etc,

सत्यं करोति सत्यापयति , pledges to be true.etc.  

  

Hope you will understand the explanation. And the same form achieved to derive special sense, with णिच्, णिङ्, आयङ्, etc. listed under सनादि- also.

  

  

"सन्क्यच्काम्यच्क्यङ्क्यषोऽथाचारक्विब्णिज्यङौ तथा।

यगाय ईयङ् णिङ् चेति द्वादशाऽमी सनादयः" इति।

  

The भ्वादि, to चुरादि are the simple verbal roots listed and divided in classes in the धातुपाठ list. And सनादि group is a collection of 12 suffixes, affixed to nouns and verbs to derive to any verb or noun to get the special meaning from them with the suffixes prescribed to them. So it does not list verbal roots, but only suffixes listed are called सनादि and the verbs derived with these are called as सनाद्यन्तधातु. It is named after the first suffix in the list. It includes, also यक्, prescribed to a specific class of verbs and nouns, grouped as कण्ड्वादि. धातुपाठ gives all the lists of 10 classes as simple roots (with the exception of 10class derived with णिच्.) कण्ड्वादि is outside the 10 classes, and listed by the first noun/verb list. Hence it is not considered as among the 10class. Those suffixes सनादि are prescribed by different सूत्र-s including the कण्ड्वादि, between 3.1.5 up to 3.1.30.

कमेर्णिङ्॥ ३।१।३०  

  

This portion contains all the 12 suffixes listed in the verse quoted already.

  

३.१.२७ कण्डू आदिभ्यो यक् । The suffix यक् prescribed to कण्ड्वादि, is included among the 12, and hence it is not considered as a separate class of verbs. like the 10 classes as the class includes both nouns and verbs. to which one of the सनादि suffix, i.e. यक् affixed to form the derived verb. Another difference between these 10 classes and सनादि and कण्ड्वादि, is that the suffixes are affixed to them, make a new verb derived both from basic verbs and nouns. with or without special meaning assigned to the derived verbs. The difference is more than this. But it will take a lengthy message.  

  

Hope this much makes clear your doubts.
