There are वैखानससूत्रs prescribed the dwelling in forests for वानप्रस्थ and संन्यास. Sorry I missed the point.

\> The obvious reason for resorting to the forest is: One desirous of tapas has to be away from worldly vyavahara and being in the city/village is not conducive for tapas. Also, in the forest, the tapasvin's food requirement is taken care of as he can feed on roots, fruits, etc. naturally available there. One can give an extended reason to the wild-animals question: in the Yoga shāstra there is a sutra: ahimsāpratiṣṭhāyām tatsannidhau vairatyāgaḥ. So, a true tapasvin established in the mahāvrata called ahimsā, will not be harmed by animals for even they give up their enmity/fierce nature towards him in his abode. In any case, the living in a forest is tough and that is why it is voluntarily sought by tapasvins and as a punishment to Kings like Rama and the Pandavas when they were banished to the forest where the usual luxuries/comforts are not available.
