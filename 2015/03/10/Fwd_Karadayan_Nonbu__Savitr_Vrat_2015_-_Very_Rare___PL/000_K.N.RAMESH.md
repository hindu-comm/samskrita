Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. **Savitri Vrat** (aka **Karadayan Nonbu** in Tamil) is an occasion to worship **Goddess Shakti** for begetting/welfare of spouse and family. Different parts of India observe Vrats in this respect in different forms (e.g. **Mangal Gauri Vrat**) and on different dates but in the South, especially Tamil Nadu, it is celebrated on day of transition of sun from **Kumbha** to **Meena**.

  

In this connection, I am happy to share a very rare **Ashta Lakshmi Stotram** which is made up of **Ashtalakshmi MantraBijaksharas** and is said to be created by **Lord Shiva**. The brief **Phalashruti** holds proof of the sanctity of this hymn - simply put, reciting this will wipe out sins accrued over several births and remove all trials and tribulations in life.

  

May We Pray To **Goddess Lakshmi** with this rare hymn!
