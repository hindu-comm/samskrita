SL Abhyankar,



 There is excitement there, yes. But definitely no though.

I award 10 points for propaganda - Sanskrit is Great!

But null points for academic strength.



Sanskrit indeed has a significant influence on the evolution of human language over the of millennia.

However, if you put any thought into what has been going on ever since, on the general subject of linguistics, a truer perspective emerges - Sanskrit is indeed Great, but by no means is it the Greatest!

The development of the medium of human communication viz. language, is on-going.

The general trend of world languages has been from Agglutinating (Inflectional) to Analytical.

Note, the direction. Linguists regard the movement from such as Sanskrit to such as English, as movement to a lower (more useable, inclusive, practical) dimension.

Their evaluation is not based on an a shallow appeal to the sentiment but to the understanding(the intellect), which reasons arelisted for thoughtful consideration.



Typical examples: the development of the Latin language as inflecting to its daughter languages.

Features according to the literature:

\- More and more "free form-words". "independent words" and word categories replaced endings.

\- Pronouns replaced the verb endings. 50% of the pronouns existed in the twelfth century.

\- Prepositions developed, were released and replaced case endings.

\- Mood endings on verbs became auxiliaries.



Here, I understand 'word categories' as 'parts of speech'.

Vedic Sanskrit readily employed prepositions, Classical Sanskrit, in an attempt to 'improve' language, by removing ambiguity, tried to do away with them.



To summarise, my critical analysis of those articles, in a single word single sentence of the vocative kind - Rubbish!
