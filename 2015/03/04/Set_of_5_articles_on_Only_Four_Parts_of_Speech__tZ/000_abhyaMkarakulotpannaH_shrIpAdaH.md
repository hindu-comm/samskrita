नमांसि सर्वेभ्यः !  
  

With the excitement of the thought that "Sanskrit is Simple - Only Four Parts of Speech" I have been able to give some wholesomeness to the thought by a set of total 5 articles.  

  
They can be read together here - <https://simplesanskrit.wordpress.com/category/only-four-parts-of-speech/>  

  
Comments and critical views are of course solicited very humbly.  
  

सस्नेहम्  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः ।  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"
