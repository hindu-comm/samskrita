Please check with this site, maintained by a Russian Scholar working on Panini's grammar:

  

<http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6748038/>

  

may be like you, who has published recently 3 volumes of readers. You may enquire himself, and if you want I can provide his personal ID who may help for translating Kashika Vritti. If you want I can send his PERSONAL ID to you personally on request if it is not there in the site.
