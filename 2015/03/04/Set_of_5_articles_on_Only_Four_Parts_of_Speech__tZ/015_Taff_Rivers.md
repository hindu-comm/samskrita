SL,

Given the cross-continental circumstances and global audience of these discussions,

I would have thought an appropriate response would be something on the lines of

"The Sanskrit word in question is a personal noun, a family name. And here are the English interpretations you requested..."

That you are "Inspiring" (challenging?) the student of an unknown language by responding in that unknown langauge, doesn't make much sense to me.

You do realise that such replies are quite useless?

And judjing by the replies of other correspondants, there is some degree of confusion as to what you are thinking?

My personal suspicions are that you are not sure yourself, consequently your efforts are serving to muddy the Sanskrit waters rather than clarify them!
