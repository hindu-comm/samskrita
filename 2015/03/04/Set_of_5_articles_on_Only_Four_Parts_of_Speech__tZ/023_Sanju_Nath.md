I do not know Sanskrit beyond being able to read the words and make vague sense - but hopefully improving by the great effort and time
given by Sri Bhatt and Sri Abhyankar particularly in this forum.  I enjoy specially Sri Abhyankar's writings in Sanskrit - it is conversational and reminds me that Sanskrit can be used for daily communications. 

  

धन्यवाद,  
Sanju
