I went through these articles. I could not see the purpose behind them and the invocation in them of Panini at every turn.

  

IMHO, one does not have to go to Panini if one's objective is, as mine is, to know enough Sanskrit to read the classical literature and use the knowlegde of Sanskrit as a searchlight to delve into India's ancient culture and history. This level of Sanskrit is easily reached by diligent study of standard text-books like Bhandarkar, accompanied by some reading of standard classics. If one aims to be a deep Sanskrit scholar or a linguist, he may need Panini but I doubt if SL Abhyankar's aim is to reach such aspirants. 

  

Taff Richards, on the other hand, seems to feel that SL Abhyankar is aiming at students of a higher level and therefore feels disappointed when he sees that the goal is not reached.

  

IMHO. this could partly be the result of the the difference between the learning processes of Indian students in India and students, almost always not Indian by upbringing, who take up Sanskrit as subject for study at the University level. An Indian student, brought up in an Indian household and speaking an Indian language as his vernacular, is already familiar with a smattering of Sanskrit through loan words in his own language taken from Sanskrit, recitations of stotras etc taught to him by rote by his elders in the family etc. Entry into Sanskrit for him is an easy process as compared to that of a non-Indian student in a non-Indian set-up. The latter naturally tries to learn Sanskrit in a more formal manner. For such a student articles like those by SL Abhyankar look like a failure. He feels that SL Abhyankar is likeप्रांशुलभ्ये फले मोहादुद्बाहुरिव वामन:

  

My advice to SL Abhyankar is to define what category of students he is aiming for and design his efforts to suit that category. The erudition displayed in these articles is not needed by the first category of students, nor are they looking for it.
