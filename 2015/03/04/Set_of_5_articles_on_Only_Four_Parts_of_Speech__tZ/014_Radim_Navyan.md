Dear Sir,  
  
I'd like to say your labour is not vain.  
My studies of sanskrit language last for 13 years. But for some of them I'd had enough. The manner, renown grammars are written in, is so elaborate, boring and unpracticable, that it's almost impossible to break them through. No motivation. Moreover, in case of mine there is no skilled teachers of sanskrit in Russia. So what to do? I'd choosen to stay away from it. But once I had hit on one of your wonderful sites. There was mind revolution for me.  
Three years have passed. Now I have ability to place my bottoms under the severe kicks of mr. Bhat :) And to blow my cheeks in front of Russian students.  
I bet, when Panini showed his scribbles to respected scholars for the first time, he had heard no word of hail. "What?! अच्, मतुप्, लट्, – you must be kidding us! Didn't you get ill?" - such speeches are more expected. But time had made it's choice. Now paninian view is what we call "standard".  
Is it good? I have huge doubt. Let me refer to just one reason of such doubt. The sanskritology in Russia as an academic science is about 200 years old. But still there is no high quality translations to any of serious sanskrit treatises. You take, you read, you compare with the original text, then you realize that such reading is just wasting your precious time. And the only purpose to them is to stoke the hearth oven.  
Why so? Because none of existent methodology of studying sanskrit is adoptable to the circumstances we live in. All we do in most cases - is just blowing cheeks to each other, getting academic titles for nothing. And having our studies as a hobby, leisure and a way of moneymaking. Almost noone is interested in knowledge itself, encrypted in sanskrit texts. That's what we have in Russia.  
  
Shortly, sir, the fresh approach you offer in your blogs really do the work. Keep on doing, pleace.  
Whatever you do, there is always someone who hates it. The haters gonna hate. That's it. The doers gonna do.  
  
With respect to each of mentioned persons,  
Radim Navyan.  
  
p.s. my sanskrit isn't that fluent to write such texts in it so far.  
  
pp.s. Can any of respected scholars help me a bit in russian translation of Kashika-vritti via email?
