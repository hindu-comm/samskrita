There is no need to have email ID identical with one's real name and one can create any ID and Google will accept it.It will not enquire about your signature and mail will accept any name as signature, you give. So such curiocity is unwarranted, in my opinion. Any it is the question to the member.

There is no such rule that writing in Devanagari script would improve the knowlege of Sanskrit, but writing in Devanagari script would increase the practice of the Devanagari Script. But writing in other scripts won't decrease the practice of Sanskrit language. It is a fancy only. The practice of laguage would need the practice of exercises in the language gradually increasing the stage of knowledge acquired upwards and not downwards and only in a fixed stage repeating the same stage. This is my sincere opinion about language learning, which needs speaking, the chance is less for Sanskrit and for writing any media could be used as script for writing. But only needs persistent effort if one wants to increase his experience with the language.
