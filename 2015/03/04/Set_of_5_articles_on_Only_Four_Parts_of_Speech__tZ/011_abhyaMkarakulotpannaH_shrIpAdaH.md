Dear Mr. Eddie Hadley / Taff Rivers  
  

Our family name has been Abhyankar. That is how it has been spelt since generations. There have been many, many Sanskrit scholars with that surname. They all spelt it like that only.  
  
For "etymology" of that surname, I guess, there might have been a family in a township, who gave the confidence of "abhayam", to the people at large. So people might have accorded their acknowledgement by calling the family by such name as "abhayaMkar". That might have then become family-surname. And by simplicity of pronunciation, it might have become "Abhyankar".  
  

By the way, there are other surnames "MahAbaL" "Savarkar", which families had their roots in the "Abhyankar"-family. Generations ago, they also had their surname as Abhyankar only.  
  

I have a curiosity about your name also. your email-ID has in it the name as Eddie (Edward ?) Hadley. But you seem to prefer to sign your messages as "Taff Rivers". Is "Taff Rivers" your pen-name ? How does it connect with "Eddie hadley" ? Just a curiosity, please.  
  

About my writing my messages in DevanAgarI, the group-name itself is samskrita-at-... So, I have taken a fancy that interactions in this group should help one practice Sanskrit. And best way to practice Sanskrit is also to write Sanskrit in DevanAgarI.  
  

In fact I have been wondering why you too would not write in Sanskrit and in DevanAgarI. You are so well-versed in it !!  
  
I am highly impressed and keep wondering with what passion and penchant you have acquired it !! Hats off !!!  

  
सस्नेहम्
