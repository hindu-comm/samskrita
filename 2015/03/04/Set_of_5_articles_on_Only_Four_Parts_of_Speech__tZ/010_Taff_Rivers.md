SL,

  

 Can I ask you please, why, as a teacher of Sanskrit via the media of English, yourespond to e-mails, written in the Latin script, inDevanagari script?

  

I am having to transliterate the lot, character by character, word by word (true, I'm exercising my own transliteration software, but . . .)

  

Even so, I have a problem with

  

 अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः

it may be just me of course, but it does not translate:

 I read it as **abhyaṅ**karakulotpannaḥ śrīpādaḥ

 is there a typo, shouldn't it read **abhayaṃ**kara-kula-utpannaḥ śrīpādaḥ
