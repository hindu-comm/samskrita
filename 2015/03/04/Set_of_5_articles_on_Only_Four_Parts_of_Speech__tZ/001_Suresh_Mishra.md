Within this week, I have also come across your, other set, of lessons: SaMskRutaadhyayanam, I presume those are yours.

They are great definitely. However, a request from novice like me. Is it possible to put in source of those couplets, shlokas, subhaashitaani?

I mean where did they appear in the literature? In many cases the reference is there but in other places if reference is given hat will be useful.
