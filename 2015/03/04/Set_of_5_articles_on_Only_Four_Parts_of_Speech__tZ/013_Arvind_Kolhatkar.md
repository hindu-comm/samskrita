Dear Taff Rivers,

  

What you say here illustrates the very point I had mentioned in my other posting here, viz. the different methodologies of 1) learning Sanskrit by native Indians in India schools and 2) learning Sanskrit outside India by students of non-Indian backgrounds at the University level.

  

The Indian student comes pre-primed with certain basic aspects of the language and its underlying culture and therefore many things that puzzle the non-Indian do not occur to him as problems at all. The correct transliteration into the Roman script of न् and ण् is a non-problem for them because they do not learn Sanskrit through transliterated Roman. They are comfortable with देवनागरी (or the South Indians scripts in which Snaskrit is sometimes written in South India) and when they see the word अभ्यंकर, they do not start worrying whether it should be pronounced as अभ्य-ण्-कर or अभ्य-न्-कर. Both these are wrong and the correct pronunciation is अभ्यङ्कर. (The surname definitely is not अभयंकर, as you seem to be thinking. You might have heard of वासुदेवशास्त्री अभ्यंकर, a well-known Pundit of the early 20th century.)

  

The solution to your problem, I dare suggest, lies in your developing familiarity with देवनागरी and using it for reading and writing Sanskrit.
The crutches of transliterated Roman should be discarded.

  

I know a little Russian. When I read or write Russian, I do so exclusively in the Kyrillic script. I do not ask native Russians to transliterate Russian in the Roman script, just because that makes things easy for me. Such an expectation will not be accepted by native Russians and will only be indicative of a certain level of arrogance on my part.

  

As to SL Abhyankar's replying to your English language posting through Sanskrit is perfectly acceptable. In this group the two primary languages of communication should be English and Sanskrit, though an occasional use of any other language should also be permitted for speciafic reasons.. It should be the prerogative of the writer to chose his language.
