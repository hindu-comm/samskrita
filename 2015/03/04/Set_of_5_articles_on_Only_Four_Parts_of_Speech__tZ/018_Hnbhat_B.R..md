There is already an English Translation of अष्टाध्यायी by SC Basu available online for download in pdf form which is based on the काशिकावृत्ति, whjich you may use:

  

[अष्टाध्यायी - English Translation](https://archive.org/download/ashtadhyayitrans06paniuoft)  

  

If you have any doubts, you can contact me either in hangout or e-mail. In most cases, the Nyasa commentary explains clearly, but not easily understandable for beginners.

  

There is Siddhantakaumudi also translated into English by the same author. Link is available here:

  

<http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2012/03/siddhanta-kaumudi-english-translation-by-srisa-chandra-basu-in-8-volumes/>  

  

All the volumes are available in Internet Archive.org.
