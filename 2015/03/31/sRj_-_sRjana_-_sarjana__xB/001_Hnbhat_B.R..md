It is grammatically wrong form as the correct form सृज् verb. Just like दृश् - दर्शन, कृष् - कर्षण, मृश्- मर्षण, etc. There is no दृशन, मृशन, is possible. It is Hindi word used in the sense of creation, and also in other languages. But may be some usages found in classical literature, influenced by the vernacular usage.

if Monier Williams lists any usage.
