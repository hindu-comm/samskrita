You can see this effect in other धातु-s too, like मिलँ. While the Paninian ल्यूट्-form is मेलन, मिलन is quite commonly heard in Kannada, Hindi and probably other languages. Even an accomplished poet like Sri. Vedanta Desika uses it in his पादुकासहस्रं - मुक्तांशुजालमिलनाद्रुचिरैः प्रवालैः

  

As Sri. Bhat says, it could be other languages influencing Sanskrit composition.
