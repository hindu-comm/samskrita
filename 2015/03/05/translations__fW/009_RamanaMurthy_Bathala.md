Dear Sir,

  

"English translation of first 4 cantos of Sisupalavadham by MS Bhandare is available at Digital Library of India."

The DLI link is not working.

I searched archive, looking for English translations of the verses. I could not find anyone. I will be thankful if you provide any English Translations of the verses.

  

Regards

Ramnana murthy
