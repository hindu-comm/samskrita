There are some others up to VI canto with commentary and translation. About Shishupalavadha, I got this reply on google search:

  

Jul 5, 2014 - Today, the Shishupala Vadha is still unobtainable in English. There is a fantastic version in German, by Eugen Hultzsch,  

  

from this page:

If it is reliable, there is no english translation available.

  

This page gives information about English Naishadhiya Carita:
