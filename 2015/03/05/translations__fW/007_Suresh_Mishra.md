The translation by Kale that you are referring to, I have a hard copy, but that has only three chapters (sarga).

I know about the German translation of Shishupal vadh, that is why I have put the post for English or Hindi.

One is not allowed to Download from Hathi trust.

  

Which one you have a pdf copy?
