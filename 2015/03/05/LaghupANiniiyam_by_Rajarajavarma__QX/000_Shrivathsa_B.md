hariH OM,

Some noble person had sponsored a few licenses of Sanskrit OCR software and I was a recipient. This is the first file I have been able to convert to text using the software. The pdf is available online. The book is an introduction to vyAkaraNam by Rajaraja Varma:

I am on the lookout for the volume 2 of this work and will scan and convert as soon as I get it. In case someone has the book kindly scan / share.

There are many places where the ocred text needs corrections. I will try to put it into wiki source soon and anyone may edit it.

 If someone can come up with an interface where we can compare the image with converted text and incorporate corrections online it will be quite useful to all.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
