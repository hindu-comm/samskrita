First note that it is pronounced as संस्कृतम् and not समस्कृतम्।

  

Next, give serious attention to whatever you do, read write your exercises. Then you will be able to learn yourself.

  

For example, you have given 6.00 you will be free. But have not given whether it is AM or PM. If it is AM, only few will be free. In the evening also, many may not be free.
