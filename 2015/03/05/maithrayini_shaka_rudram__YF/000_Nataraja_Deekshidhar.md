Scholars,

Can anyone send me MATHRAYINI SHAKA rudram? What is the differences between Thaithriya yajur rudram? My one of elders says that there is TWO 'namah sivayacha' in Maithrayini shaka rudram, Is it True?

I just go thro this link which is very useful but i could not copy and paste of the line of Rudram.<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/samskrita/JU2_HopIwC8/m5TJHbjlYgQJ>

  

If that Maithrayini rudram may be able to copy and paste function we will get more pleasure.

  

with thanks
