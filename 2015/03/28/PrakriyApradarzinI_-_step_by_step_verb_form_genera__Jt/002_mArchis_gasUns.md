It's good to see that Sanskrit NLP finally becomes open. Sanskrit computing is not new, there is a 20 year history. But it's Dhaval to open the code for the first time.

Right from कर्तृवाच्य कर्मवाच्य भाववाच्य there is "Mandatory field. Wait for ajax to load. " but if not chosen, I get a popup with text that says I should choose one.

What is the difference? उपसर्गाःcontains all the attested possible combinations of prefixes?
