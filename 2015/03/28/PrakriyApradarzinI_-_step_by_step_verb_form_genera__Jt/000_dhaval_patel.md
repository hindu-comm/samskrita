Dear scholars,  

Sorry for cross posting.  
  

It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you all the following software developed by Shivakumari Katuri and me.  
  

Name - PrakriyApradarzinI - an open source tiGanta generator.  

Code - <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb>  

Testing website - <http://www.lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/SanskritVerb/tiGanta.html>  

To report errors - <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues/new>  
  

N.B. - Please be patient while the website loads the output. It usually takes 2-3 minutes to give output.  

  

General information -  
It is based on a rule based model as compared to paradigm based model of verb generators. Most of the verb form generators available online do not give the step by step derivation which is crucial for beginners in Sanskrit grammar.  

This machine is an open source PHP code which derives Sanskrit verb forms from given verb with step by step derivation according to sahajabodha text book of Pushpa Dikshit.  

It has been cross checked with Siddhantakaumudi partially. Still testing is ongoing. If you stumble upon some error, please flag an issue in Github link given above.  

  

A sample derivation generated from machine for dhAtu bhU is attached in the zip file.
