Actually, your post doesn't make it clear what you wish to convey.  

Do you want to say that someone has said something about 'Instant Response without checking'?  

Or, do you want to ask for an instant response for the mentioned verse?  
  

And, the shloka you wrote is incorrect at many places.  

Please, type in either devanAgarI or follow a standard transliteration scheme if you write in Roman. This will help others to get correct version.  

It will also force you to learn to write correctly.
