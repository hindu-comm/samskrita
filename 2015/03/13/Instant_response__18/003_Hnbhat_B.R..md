This verse had been posted earlier Ramakrishnan as समस्या but every time with similar typo error in roman with a wrong subject line, but with a correct text in Devanagari with English Translation:

[कुन्तीपुत्रो विनायकः १](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/AkZOTAFEOW8/e8eqq3v5ptYJ)  

  

This verse was discussed in a different group, differently:

[कुन्तीपुत्रो विनायकः २](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/padyadhaaraa/vi5VZdmsW78/2GXPuYm1m6MJ)  

by the practitioners of Sanskrit poetry composition. The second half or the last line had to be filled in as a समस्या, which apparently irrelevant statement and the solution should be solved by the aspirants who want to become scholars. This is the idea in the verse.
