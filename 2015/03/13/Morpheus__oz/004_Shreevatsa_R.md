This is wonderful!  

Congratulations on such an excellent tool, and thanks especially for making it open-source.

With some polishing, this has potential to revolutionize reading of Sanskrit on a computer.

  

To anyone else who (like me) took some time to understand how to use it:

\- At<http://morph.diglossa.org/sa> in the upper yellow box (NOT the lower white box), paste a Devanagari word, e.g. say विहाय (you can also type it, but the input scheme is an inconvenient one).

\- Now double-click the word.

  

It shows the root and meaning of the word, and also vibhakti and number.

  

(Also, you can select the word and hit Shift. If you select the word and hit Tab it shows occurrences of the word in (currently) the Bhagavad Gita.)

  

Some cosmetic improvements could be made to the output and input, but this is already fantastic.

  

Although a morphological analyzer for Sanskrit words has been done before, I think this is the first open-source one, and the fact that it runs entirely in Javascript and its output is in a nice unobtrusive box means that in principle it could be embedded on any web page containing Sanskrit text.
