Namaste

A friend, Shobha, is writing an article based on possible scientific references found in Indian mythology.

Please see her email below.

If you have any suggestions for her, please email her directly at[ansh...@gmail.com]().

Thank you

Venetia

  

I am looking for authentic references to mythlogical events/stories that can be linked to modern science.

For eg: Cloning is very similar to the process in which Kauravas were born.

Abhimanyu hearing his father speak to him in his womb is a reality and neonatal science has proved it- giving rise to music for the womb and the like.
