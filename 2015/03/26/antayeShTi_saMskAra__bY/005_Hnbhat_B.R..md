After all reading English Translation of any Prayoga grantha, the practical manuals for antyeshti, what do you want to know?

  

No other preists utilize these manuals need English translation, as they are trained in the profession, during their training. For others, they are of no utility, as it belongs to the domain of the believers of the religion of Hindu system, who believe in rebirth and birth cycle, till one is relieved of the results of the karma-s, by philosophical practice. For others, it is a customary ritual based on the Puranic mythology. Believers of different schools of philosophy have their own means to attain salvation. So what is your requirement? I think neither of the two listed above is your aim.

  

For your question you may digest the Indian System of Philosophy and their stand on the Sixteen Samskara-s pUrva samskara-s and apara-samskara-s, of which the antyeshti is the first one. Each of the system has got their karma, according to the system. Now, your Antyeshti, does not belong to any of the systems of Philosophy, but common to Hindu reliion, unless one adopts ascetic life, from birth to death, it is a must.
