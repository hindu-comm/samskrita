It depends on the suutra that one follows.  
  
For example, you would find aapastamba and boudhaayana in KYV.  
  
baudhaayana is fairly elaborate: for example the number of pinda varies.  
  
Secondly, per aapastamba there are two types apara-kriyaa:  
pitR^i-medha and brahma-medha.  
  
brahma medha is slightly more elaborate in aapatamba compared to pitR^i medha.  
  
For example brahma-medha has two whole anuvaaka-s (from TS 1.4) while  
giving the fire whereas pitR^i-medha has only few short sentences.

There are minor variants here too. Per aapastamba the pot of fire  
(pretaagni) has to be emptied on the heart directly on the body.  
  
Whereas I have seen in couple of mahaarashtrian braahmaNa funerals thy  
use a stick with some cloth tied on to the end and without seeding the  
body, that stick is inserted into the pyre -- pile of logs.

I have never attended any shri-vishNava funeral. So sorry I will not  
be of much help here  
  
There is a book from raaamakrishNa maTha , Mylapore on this topic. It  
contains both the medha with shloka/mantra in samskrita and tamiz  
transliteration. I am located about 2000 km away from it in Thane near  
Mumbai.  
  
  
Hope that helps.
