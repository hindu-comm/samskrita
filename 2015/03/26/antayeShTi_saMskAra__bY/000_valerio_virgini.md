Dear members  
  
I would like to know if the vaiṣṇava have a unique funeral rite or if this differs in some details between the various schools vaiṣṇava .  
  
There is a part of the rite (hymns, prayers, mantras, actions) that is always common in every funeral ceremony?  
  
What are the text (for vaiṣṇava) that give indications on funeral rituals?  
  

thanks  

Valerio
