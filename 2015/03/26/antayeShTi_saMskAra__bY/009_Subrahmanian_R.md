Sirs,

  

With reference to the detailed clarification of Sri Rajagopala Iyer, I wish to add, similar to the practice mentioned by Sri Iyer, in Varanasi also the agni is not brought in a pot from home to be emptied on the heart, but lit in the smasana, using stick of a particular plant/ tree.

  

Regards

  

R Subrahmanian
