Hi  
All are the same for all Brahmins. Vaishnavas and smartas and saivas also called as vipra. The all sutras would says that ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम् इति ब्रहमविदो दक्षिणे कर्णे जपेत्. Means brahmavid is who related with varna. Not with Vishnava or smartha. Like this all are same. Somewhere minor changes are there but those can't have the power to change the kramam in the samskara.
