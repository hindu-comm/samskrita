Please find attached four converters for converting text in -  

\(1\) Sanskrit98  

\(2\) Sanskrit99  

\(3\) DV-TT-Vedic  

\(4\) Vedic97  
  

legacy fonts to Unicode.  
  

These fonts have been especially used for writing sanskrit because they have symbols for Vedic signs in addition to other useful features. But with inclusion of Vedic signs in extended Devanagari Unicode, it is now possible to write Sanskrit in Unicode too. If Unicode Devanagari fonts like Chandas and Siddhanta are used, these texts can be seen without any problem. In this way, these font converters can be very useful.  
  

For design of DV-TT-Vedic and Vedic97 converters, I have used the character mapping used by Shri Marcis Gasuns in VBEE converters put at Github. Special thanks to him for that.  
  

Please note that these converters will give good results for text copied from DOC/TXT files. It may give not so good results for text copied from PDF files because the text copied from PDF files is different than the original text depending on which PDF tool the file was made with and which PDF reader it is being copied from.
