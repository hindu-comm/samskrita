Can anyone here add Jim Funderburk (who maintains <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>) to this thread? I wanted to thank him for making avialable the digitized sources of these wonderful dictionaries in the first place; and notify him about our plans/ progress in making them available in the stardict format ( <https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/dictionaries>) for use offline with mobile phones/ tablets etc..
