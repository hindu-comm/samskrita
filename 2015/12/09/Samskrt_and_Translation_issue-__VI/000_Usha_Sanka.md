Here I copy-paste a relevant portion from the complete essay from the above link.

It speaks of some bigger issue- of which language happens to be a part. Sharing as I thought, its very important.

-------------------------  

## **The Problem of Language in India’s Political Discourse**

A related problem is that India’s traditional political discourse has occurred in Sanskrit and in India’s native languages, rather than in English that dominates global discussions today. The English language today does not have equivalent terms to accurately translate India’s dharmic thought. This extends to all other western languages.

It is well known that t**he terms of India’s spiritual discourse have been subject to significant distortions by English renderings, such as dharma as religion, moksha as salvation, or Yoga as asana.**

The same is true of India’s traditional social discourse. Some of these distortions like varna as caste have been quite misleading. We must recognize that just as the West does not have an appropriate vocabulary for Indian spiritual thought, it is also lacking in one for India’s social thought.

However, it is necessary to develop a terminology for India’s dharmic social thought that is meaningful in modern English in order to reach the global audience. This should include key untranslatable Sanskrit terms like the term dharma itself, much as how Vivekananda, Chinmayananda and Dayananda put Vedanta into a clear modern idiom of English with key Sanskrit terms to clarify its nuances. For this to occur, **we should avoid describing India’s dharmic school of thought according to English terms of political debate today.**
