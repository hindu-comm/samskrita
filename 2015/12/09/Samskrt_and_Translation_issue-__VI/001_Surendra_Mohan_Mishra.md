thanks. this is a pertinent point. the moment we shift to a non-sanskrit particularly a western language, translation creates difficulties as it dislocates the perspective. the right to freedom of stipulation ought to be used through which the intended meaning is not lost in translation. indian traditions of knowledge must evolve further from within that the concepts are not dispersed. why can't we develop our own parameters of social, political and spiritual discourse as we had been doing for milleniums ? regards.
