Sirs,

  

On the question of ‘Interrogative Form of Verbs’, as Sri S L Abhyankar has stated in English sometimes syntax conveys the interrogative sense. But a statement like ‘Rama killed Ravana’ cannot be changed to interrogative by syntax. And in Sanskrit all syntax would be permissible. So syntax cannot generally be used to convey this sense.



I beg to differ from Sri GSS Murthy. The ‘aa’ is not a separate word (here) but it modifies a word to connote interrogative sense. There is some grammatical rule ए या मुदलुं आ ओ कडैयुम् (words starting with ‘e’ ‘ya’ or ending with ‘aa’ ‘O’ connote interrogation.



Where it is expected that emphasis would convey interrogative sense, it presupposes that spoken form does not have full concordance with the script.



In Tamil, the modification of a word to interrogation is not limited to the verb. (Perhaps the same is true in respect of other Dravidian languages). It can modify a noun, adverb, adjective, or pronoun also.

नेट्रु अवन् नगैयै तिरुडिनान् is a simple statement (meaning verbatim Yesterday - He - Jewel - Stole) and conveying: He stole (the) jewellery yesterday.

A simple interrogative sentence in English would be: Did he steal the jewellery yesterday?



In Tamil any of the four words can be separately converted to interrogative -

नेट्रा अवन् नगैयै तिरुडिनान्

नेट्रु अवना नगैयै तिरुडिनान्

नेट्रु अवन् नगैयैया तिरुडिनान्

नेट्रु अवन् नगैयै तिरुडिनाना

I am unable to conceive of other languages conveying these four separate questions with the same naturalness or facility.

In the first sentence, the question is ‘was it yesterday?’ - the adverb

In the second sentence, the question is ‘was it he?’ - the pronoun

In the third one it is ‘Was it jewellery that he stole?’ - the noun

The last question is on ‘stealing’. - the verb.



Besides modification for interrogative sense, negation is conveyed also by modifying the verb. (e.g.) theriyum (I know), theriyadhu (I do not know), theriyuma theriyAdha (do you know or not?).

I am sure Sanskrit should be rich to include such words, though I am ignorant of it.



With respect to all

R Subrahmanian
