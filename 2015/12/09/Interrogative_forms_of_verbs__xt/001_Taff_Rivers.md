 As to a verbal inflection - those more learned than I may confirm that the answer is **No**.  
  
 As for the interrogative, the equivalent of the Latin interrogative *symbol* ? is a ***word*** :  

  
BTW **vā** is a conjuction, more specifically a disjunction. It is not an interrogative.  
  
  
  
**kim**  
• is much used as a particle of interrogation like the Lat. num, an, sometimes translatable by 'whether?' but oftener serving only like a note of interrogation to mark a question (e.g. kiṃ_vyādhā_vane\_'smin_saṃcaranti, 'do hunters roam about in this wood?' In an interrogation the verb, if uncompounded with a preposition, generally retains its accent after kim, Pāṇ. 8-1, 44). To this sense may be referred the kim expressing inferiority, deficiency, &c. at the beginning of compounds (e.g. kiṃ-rājan, what sort of king? i.e. a bad king, Pāṇ. 2-1, 64; v, 4, 70).  
• also the kim prefixed to verbs with a similar meaning (e.g. kim-adhīte, he reads badly, Pāṇ. 8-1, 44, Kāś.) kim-uta, or kim-uta-vā or kim-athavā-uta, whether-or-or, R. Śak. Bhartṛ. &c. (cf. uta.) \[282,3\]  
  
  
**kim**  
• is very frequently connected with other particles, as follows: kim_aṅga, wherefore then?, ṚV.  
• atha_kim, see atha.  
• kim_api, somewhat, to a considerable extent, rather, much more, still further, Śak. Megh. &c.  
• kim_iti, why?, Śak. Kum. Pañcat. &c.  
• kim-iva, what for?, Śiś. xvi, 31.  
• kim-u or kim-uta how much more? how much less?, ṚV. ŚBr. MBh. &c.  
• kiṃ_kila, what a pity! (expressing dissatisfaction), Pāṇ. 3-3, 146.  
• kiṃ-ca, moreover, further, Pañcat. Kathas. &c.  
• what more (expressing impatience), Śak.  
• kiṃ-cana (originally -ca_na, negative = 'in no way'), to a certain degree, a little, Kathas.  
• (with a negation) in no way, not at all, MBh. i, 6132.  
• kiṃ-cid, somewhat, a little, MBh. R. &c.  
• kiṃ_tarhi, how then? but, however, Pāṇ. 2-2, 4, Pat.; iv, 1, 163, Kaś.  
• kiṃ-tu, but, however, nevertheless (bearing the same relation to tu that kiṃ-ca bears to ca), MBh. R. &c.  
• kiṃ-nu, whether indeed? (a stronger interrogative than kim alone), MBh. R. &c.  
• how much more? how much less?, Bhag. i, 35.  
• kiṃ_nu_khalu, how possibly? (a still stronger interrogative), Śak.  
• kim_punar, how much more? how much less?, R. Bhag. ix, 33 &c.  
• however, Bālar.  
• but, ib.  
• kiṃ_vā, whether? or whether?, Śak. Pañcat. &c.  
• or (often a mere particle of interrogation).  
• kiṃ_svid, why?, Kathas. xxvi, 75.  
• a stronger interrogative than kim alone, ṚV. MBh. Kathas. \[282,3\]
