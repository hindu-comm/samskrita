Everybody forgot that every language has its own idiomatic usages and intonations and could not be used in another language giving the same meaning.

If one wants in another language, the same idea could be conveyed with the vocabularies within that languages. In Sanskrit, adding vowels like in Tamil, would make it strange language in writing. For example, गच्छतिया? पाठशालामा? Looks strange. Instead, गच्छति वा न वा? गच्छति किम् ? etc. makes it assimilated to Tamil or Kannada interjections used for questioning. with interjections A which could be easily added to वा, but वा is not seen used in the Interrogative sense.

merely as an expletive. (*f*) In-
