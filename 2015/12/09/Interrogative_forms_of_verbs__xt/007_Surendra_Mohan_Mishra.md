namaamsi.good discussion on interrogatives in samskrit. intonation of course signals a speaker's intention to ask. but in writing some expression is needed. it may be only a ? mark or an explicit word. among the prefixes only 'api' stands for a question.so also 'atha' does.'kim' 'nanu' and 'kinnu',' 'vaa'(afterwards).

someone complained regarding the hybrid variety of orange called "kinnu' as unfit for worship as it's not mentioned in any shastra. another pandit who relished the juicy delicacy suddenly quipped that in durgaasaptas'atii there are 4 kinnu-s in one verse ! regards.
