नमस्ते श्रीमन्श्रीकण्ठ-महोदय !  

  

To answer your basic question about "interrogative form of verbs", in Sanskrit verbs do not have an interrogative form. Such question might have come up in your mind, because in English verbs other than 'to be' and 'to have' need forms of 'to do' to serve as interrogative auxiliaries. Syntax also is important. "I am going" is present continuous. But "Am I going ?" becomes interrogative.

  

In Sanskrit, just the intonation would also do. For example, सः गच्छति is present simple. But the same sentence in interrogative intonation would become interrogative !

  

Alternatively one may put the sentence as अपि गच्छति सः. This syntax would make it interrogative, even without the question mark.
