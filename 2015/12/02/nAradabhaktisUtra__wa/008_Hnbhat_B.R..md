I don't think when the correct and perfectly usage is available, the Vedic usage and confused usage should be preferred. More than twenty five meanings are available for avi most popular is the sheep, except in Vedic usage and not an adverb, but adjective only.

  

Anyhow you are free choose the correct word or confusing word.
