\> it can also beद्वंद्व? NO.  
In द्वन्द्व it could not be singular, but duel as the name itself suggest. If singular, it would be in singular and neuter gender.  

  

Clear.  

  

\> But forśraddhatethe transliteration is right.  

NO. Compare the transliterated text by me with what you have given carefully.  

  

OK, I realize only now that the two sutras are different: one withश्रद्धत्ते, and the other, withश्रद्धते,certainly wrong.

ok, āvirbhavati is definitely right.Also in other translations it is given this meaning.  

But still I do not understand whyअविis excluded.  

  

शीघ्रमेवाविर्भवति =एव+अविः +भवति=एवाविर्भवति

I can not see the error on the application of the rules of sandhi.  

  

thank you  

valerio
