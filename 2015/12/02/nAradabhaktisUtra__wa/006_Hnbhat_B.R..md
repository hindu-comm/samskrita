\> ok, āvirbhavati is definitely right.Also in other translations it is given this meaning.

\> But still I do not understand whyअविis excluded.

\> शीघ्रमेवाविर्भवति =एव+अविः +भवति=एवाविर्भवति  
\> I can not see the error on the application of the rules of sandhi.

There is no application error at all. And if you feel it is correct, you use can it as in Vedic usage:

**अवि**aviअवि*a.*Ved. \[अव्-इन्\] Favourable, kindly or favou- rably disposed. अविं वृधाम शग्मियं सखायं वरुणम् Av.5.1. 9.

If you feel the meaning is correct. Which have so many meanings. But not connected with bhU, like Avis.

avi\[L=6825\]\[p=[0095-c](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MW72Scan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=0095)\]*avi, is, is, i*(fr. rt.*av*), Ved. favour-  
able, attached to, kindly disposed; (*is*), m. f. a sheep;  
the woollen Soma strainer; (*is*), m. a master; the  
sun; air, wind; a mountain; a wall or enclosure; a  
cover made of the skin of mice; a rat; a blanket;  
the shawl goat; (*is*), f. an ewe; a woman in her  
courses \[cf. Lith.*awi-s;*Slav.*ovjza;*Lat.*ovi-s;*  
Gr.(greek) ὄϊςGoth.*avistr*\].*—* *Avi-kaṭoraṇa, as,*m. a  
kind of tribute (perhaps consisting of sheep).*—* *Avi-*  
*gandhikā,*f., N. of a plant*=* *Aja-gandhā. —* *Avi-*  
*dugdha*or*avi-dūsa*or*avi-marīsa*or*avi-soḍha,*  
*am,*n. the milk of an ewe.*—* *Avi-paṭa, as,*m.  
sheep's skin, woollen cloth.*—* *Avi-pāla, as,*m. a  
shephered.*—* *Avi-priya, as,*m. ‘liked by sheep,’ N.  
of the grass Oplismenus Frumentaceus; (*ā*), f., N. of  
another plant.*—* *Avi-mat,* *ān,* *atī, at,*Ved. possessing  
sheep.*—* *Avi-sthala, am,*n. ‘sheep-place,’ N. of a  
town.  
  
But note the usage with BhU and it is indeclinable.

āvis\[L=9401\]\[p=[0131-c](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MW72Scan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=0131)\]*āvis,*ind. (said to be connected

  
with*vahis*and*ava;*or, according to others, fr.  
*ā-vid:*cf. Gr.(greek) ἐξLat.*ex?*), before the eyes,  
openly, manifestly, evidently; (very often joined to  
the roots*as,* *bhū,*and*kṛ.*)

In classical usage, it means :

-विः 1 A sheep; (*f.*also in this sense);
