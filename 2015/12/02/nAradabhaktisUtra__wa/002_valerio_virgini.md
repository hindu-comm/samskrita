Thanks dr. bhat, ... for teaching and for your patience.  

  

It could be a bahuvrihi, पूर्वस्मात् पूर्वा - like the other uncompounded उत्तरस्मात् उत्तरस्मात् - or कर्मधारय compound पूर्वा च पूर्वा च - पूर्वपूर्वा.

  

it can also beद्वंद्व?  

  

तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति...They are compound verbs and have been explained many times.  

This structure has been explained in earlier posts;

तीर्थीकुर्वन्तिThese verbal compounds are absent in the Italian language, therefore, is difficult for me to assimilate. In addition, the previous examples is a name+kr and seemed, to me, different. like a
कृदंत**conjugate**  

  

  

  

  

आविः is not at all a verb, or adjective  

  

अवि in MW dictionary  

mfn.  

-   (√अव्), favourable, kindly disposedAV.v, 1, 9

  

I thoughtit wasthenominative caseofअवि  

  

Please correctly transliterate.

Here also you split in roman ekādaśa-khā, where it is not two words.

Yes, I have transliterated bad, sorry.  

  

But for*śraddhate*the transliteration is right.
