Greetings reverential by pious persons.

  

the ignorant saysविष्णाय (use the dative form of a name in -a, for a name in -u).

The learned person saysविष्णवे (using the appropriate form)

both, in a similar way, are meritorious, becauseKṛṣṇaappreciates the sentiment.  

  

(I hope that my English is not worst of my Sanskrit!)  

  

Really beautiful!

... and also very comforting.
