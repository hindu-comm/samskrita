Surely the Vedic usage must be considered in Vedic works.  

It is rarely appropriate in classical works.  

  

But this, being a treatise on bhakti, Vedic meaning does not conflict with the principles of the work, on the contrary, (perhaps accidentally) speak of the satisfaction of the Lord.

The effect of bhakti is to satisfy the Lord.

For this I want consider this meaning also.  

  

My knowledge of Sanskrit is very low, but the significance of sheep, I would never have considered

  

:-)

  

thanks
