\> तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति...They are compound verbs and have been explained many times.  
\>  
\> This structure has been explained in earlier posts;

\> तीर्थीकुर्वन्तिThese verbal compounds are absent in the Italian language, therefore, is difficult for me to assimilate. In addition, the previous examples is a name+kr and seemed, to me, different. like a
कृदंतconjugate

Here also the same:

name+ कृ  
तीर्थ-√कृ -

अतीर्थं तीर्थं कुर्वन्ति =  
तीर्धी-कुर्वन्ति, etc.

सुकर्मन्-√कृ -

  
सुकर्मीकुर्वन्ति कर्माणि,

सच्छास्त्र- √कृ -  
सच्छास्त्रीकुर्वन्ति शास्त्राणि ।।
