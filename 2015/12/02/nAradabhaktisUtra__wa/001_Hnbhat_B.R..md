It could be a bahuvrihi, पूर्वस्मात् पूर्वा - like the other uncompounded उत्तरस्मात् उत्तरस्मात् - or कर्मधारय compound पूर्वा च पूर्वा च - पूर्वपूर्वा.

तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थाणि, सुकर्मीकुर्वन्ति कर्माणि why do you split tīrthī and sukarmī seperatre words and wonder? They are compound verbs and have been explained many times.  

This structure has been explained in earlier posts;

The same. Why do you split the wors and wonder. One is adverb and the other verb qualified by it. You split both "sandhi" apart and wonder why they are separated? There are no two verbs at all. आविः is not at all a verb, or adjective, but adverb indeclinable, like श्रद्.

एकाधा अपि

एकादशधा 

ekādaśa-khā...I do not recognize this form of the number eleven.  

You could not find such a form, but only like एकधा, you will find एकादश-धा.

  

Please correctly transliterate.

Here also you split in roman ekādaśa-khā, where it is not two words.

\>श्रद्धत्ते, --śrad dhatte  
\> *śraddhate*...I do not recognize this form of śraddha.

  

Here also you wrongly transliterate. There is no formśraddha, but like आविर्भवति, here also it isśrad dhatte - the first bleing indeclinable, the second part is the verb.
