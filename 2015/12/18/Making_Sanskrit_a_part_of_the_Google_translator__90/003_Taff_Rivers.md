 Something is wrong...  
  
On submission in site <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/SHMT/index.html>  
  
there is a redirection and my browser reports:  

#  

#  " Sorry, the website [sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in) cannot be found."

  
Elsewhere, all I am able to view are screenshots of what seem to be simulated 'translations'.
