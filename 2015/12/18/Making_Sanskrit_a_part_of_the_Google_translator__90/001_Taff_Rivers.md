Ken et al Sanskrit NLP translaters.  
  

Sanskrit is not translatable!  
  
Even for the endangered species that are bilingual native speakers, the process of disambiguating words out of long strings of letters is often a matter of choice.  
  
Choosing from that list of grammatically correct ambiguities, is problematic, alternatives often being epistematically contractdictary.  
  
This striking fact is immediately obvious to anyone who actually tries the translating for himself.  
  
Computerised assistance in the process of making out the words has been available for many a year. The numerous possible breakdowns provided for, by even short phrases bear witness to this difficulty.  
  
That difficulty is passed over to us humans, to resolve, by manually selecting each and every Sanskrit word proffered, to obtain a list of English definitions (note the plural) from which to choose.  
  
Many a serious organisation from many a country have and are translating and trawling these musty manuscripts for practical information. Viz. medical remedies (India, UK). possibility of telepathic means of communication with submarines (USA WWII).  
  
Personally, I seek to harness (as in Raja Yoga) my finite mental powers, to apply to such situations as these, that we do not embark on lost causes.  
  
These computerised tools, including source code, are available for downloading by request - thus for us humans to extract sense from the written recordings of the thoughts of the ancient ones - and to evaluate them in the light of accumulated knowledge of the workings of the three worlds.  
  
**The Sanskrit Heritage website**, at URL [sanskrit.inria.fr](http://sanskrit.inria.fr), provides tools for the processing of the Sanskrit language.  
  
This site offers public access to various Web services and Sanskrit lexicons **since 2003**.  
**It offers dictionary search, declension/conjugation, stemming, and segmentation/tagging/parsing of Sanskrit sentences.**  
  
The site started as a set of tools to exploit a digital version of the Sanskrit Heritage Dictionary, which had been developped as a personal independent project by Gérard Huet **since 1996** as a Sanskrit-French dictionary intended as a small encyclopedia of Indian culture. These tools use the finite-state methods implemented in the ZEN Objective Caml library to provide efficient lexicon representation, morphology generation, and **segmentation by sandhi recognition.**  
  
This technology was published in 2005 as A Functional Toolkit for Morphological and Phonological Processing, Application to a Sanskrit Tagger.  
  
In 2007 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between INRIA (Institut de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique) in Paris and UoH (**University of Hyderabad**) for establishing a Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Joint Team aiming at the research and development of inter-operable tools for the computerized processing of Sanskrit, by Dr Gérard Huet at the Sanskrit team of the INRIA Rocquencourt Center and Pr Amba Kulkarni at the Department of Sanskrit Studies of UoH.  
This resulted in the development of an interface allowing the Heritage sandhi splitter to be used as front end to the Sanskrit Studies parser, which in turn was available in the Heritage Engine as an alternative  
parser.  
  

Seasons Greeting to you all.
