Raama,  
  
 The input scheme used with iTranslator is not Unicode but ASCII.  
i.e. The ITRANS scheme inputs combinations of characters to output the Unicode Roman Transliteration with its diacritics and ligatures.  
  
***But*** you can use a drop down pick list for direct entry of all types of Devanagari characters.  
  
lTo access it, click **Tools** on the Menu bar and select **Insert Devanagari Character**.  
  
Then click the Keep Open box at the bottom, to do just that.  
Note the Ligatures button along side it!  
  
The Latin ITRANS equivalents appear on its status bar as you mouse-over the Devanagari.  
  
You don't say what script you want for your notes, but to mix plain English along with the Sanskrit toogle between the two scripts with a pair of hash tags - ##.  
  
Experiment - it's all there in the Help file!  
  
 Regards,  
  
Taff,
