Taff,

I can only read Devanagari - I get very uncomfortable reading any other rendering. So I was trying to convert it to devangari using itranslator.itwas good for most part say about 80% but things like visarga etc did not appear correctly.

Then I asked here ,but had a vague recollection that similar question was asked in this forum before so I searched iTranslator and came across my own old post.



Now I book marked the page for future use, and hope I do not forget that

regards
