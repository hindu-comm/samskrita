hello,

I found this text with bhashya - I need this for some personal digital notes taking while I learn the text

<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/yoga/patyogbu.htm>  

  

I used iTranslator and the text rendering is not correct, visarga and other sanyukta letters are showing up correctly

  

I would appreciate if someone can please tell me how to get correct text.

धन्यवाद: - राम
