An announcement of general interest from documentation surrounding a new podcasting tool:

  

  

# Context

There are many popular tools in a variety of platforms to subscribe and listen to podcasts (see subscription guide[SB16](https://goo.gl/6DJjji).). (I use Doggcatcher paid on Android). It turns out to be easier to listen to audio files in this way without the chores such as manual downloads and checking for updates.

# [](https://github.com/vedavaapi/scala-akka-http-server/blob/master/README_PODCASTING_TOOLS.md#archive-item-to-podcast-tool)Archive-item-to-podcast tool

Given audio files hosted in some internet site (like [archive.org](http://archive.org)), creating a podcast feed involved some manual labor (adding posts to a blog etc.. as described in this guide[SB15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWLwJvtnfJctdNYx3qSDHZyDKLPeQ21o3eHNJfQ7Xj0/edit).). Now, this manual labor can be eliminated using a new open source web tool - deployed at[vedavaapi](http://vedavaapi.org:9090/swagger#/podcastsv1/getPodcast)(\<--- IT'S HERE), which can be used to generate a podcast. Further details regarding its usage (with suggestions for submitting to Google Play, ITunes) should be available using documentation in the linked page.

  

# Try it out!

  
But wait - Check[this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMhtMaHCQpucqxH3aVcmYmPvQyV9vmunvckV2ARvD4M/edit#gid=0)to see if the relevant podcast has already been generated.  
If the output looks good, you can submit the generated podcast URL (copy from the generated CURL command) to indices like[Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/podcasts/portal#p:id=playpodcast/all-podcasts),[ITunes](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/#/new-feed/), Stitcher and TuneInRadio.  
And let us know via[this form](https://goo.gl/forms/jTT3DvXTVqu1jU0j2)!  

  

# Collaboration request to podcaster makers

shrI sanjay and friends have created many podcasts (see[this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMhtMaHCQpucqxH3aVcmYmPvQyV9vmunvckV2ARvD4M/edit#gid=0)). I hope that others are as inspired by it as I was to expand their work. So far I just added one podcast from an archive item:

  

[TABLE]

  



It would be great if someone could take care of submitting this feed to Itunes and Stitcher (so that I won't have to create new accounts, get access to itunes store etc..). And I welcome folks interested in samskrita and shaastra (even in other languages) to create more such podcasts using the tool provided. (<https://archive.org/details/Sanskrit-Audiobook-Samskrita-Bharati> is an example of something I want to listen to, but am yet to turn into a podcast, and there are many more.) Anticipating such participation, I've created a new shared email-inbox (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/podcast-bhaaratii> ), so that one can use the non-personal mail id[podcast-bhaaratii@googlegroups.com]() when creating a feed for public consumption. Just let me know. jaya durge!
