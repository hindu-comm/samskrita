Hope the difference between two is made clear.

In short, स्तोत्र means praise of god in general, which can be composed either in versified structure श्लोक or in prose. And need not always be in श्लोक only and is not synonym of श्लोक and श्लोक is the metrical form in four पाद-s or दण्डक without the limitation of पाद called दण्डक. And the स्तोत्र is the content of the versified structure.

The nominal verb usage of श्लोक, *श्लोकैरुपस्तौति*उपश्लोकयति - उपश्लोकयते to praise with verses, this difference is clear.

The content of versified structure need not always सतोत्र, but it can be any description, history, stories loke Pancatantra, Hitopadesha.
