Here the meter श्लोक is used to describe the event of questioning by Dhritarashtra and why to confuse both?

Here you are again confusing poetry with श्लोक.

In fact, श्लोक can be used to praise any one or describe any thing. Stotra can also be in श्लोक or gadya, which can praise.  

The questioner was confused and started confusing others.
