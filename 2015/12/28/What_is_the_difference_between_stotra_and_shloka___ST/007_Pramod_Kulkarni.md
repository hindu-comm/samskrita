May be too late to comment

Shloka, as pointed out by Abhyankarji is another name another name for the meter Anushtubha. This meter consists of 4 charans of 8 letters each. So a total of 32 letters per shloka. This meter is so immensly popular that the length of any literary work is measured in multipals of 32 as so many shlokas. For example a poem in Shardulvikriidita (19 letter long meter ) of 96 shlokas is 19\*4\*96/32= 228 shloka long. Fraction may be ignored or rounded .
