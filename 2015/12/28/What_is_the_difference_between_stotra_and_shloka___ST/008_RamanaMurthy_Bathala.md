Dear sir,

  

If श्लोक is prasing in verse, then can anyone tell me whether Bhavadgita is book of श्लोकs or just book of verses?

Let us take first verse:धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे ..... In this verse, we see just asking what happened in the battle field. There is no praise to anyone. Can this be called श्लोक?

  

When I was reading about poet/rishi Sri Valmiki, it was said that श्लोक is generated from शोक(sorrow). How can sorrow become praise?

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
