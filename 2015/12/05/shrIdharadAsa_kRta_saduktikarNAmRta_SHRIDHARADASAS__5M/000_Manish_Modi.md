Compiler Shridharadasa selected 2380 beautiful Sanskrit verses in arranged them topic wise. He selected verses by 500 Sanskrit poets and created this masterly collection, winning the everlasting gratitude of generations of Sanskrit lovers.

Born to Vattudasa, the Maha-Samanta-Chudamani of Bengal’s ruler King Lakshmanasena, Shridharadasa rose to become a Maha-Mandalika himself, under the kingship of Lakshamanasena. He completed this anthology by 1206 CE. He selected verses by classical Sanskrit poets like Kalidasa and Bana but also included Sanskrit verses by his contemporaries. He made it a point to mention the names of each poet whose verses he had chosen thus making it possible for all those who love poetry to know about the many splendid poets who wrote in Sanskrit.

He arranged this work in 5 pravaahas {streams}, each containing several viichis {waves}.

Each viichi has exactly 5 Sanskrit verses. Each viichi focuses on a specific topic. There are 476 viichis in all, each representing a different topic. The topics chosen vividly depict the lifestyles and weltenschaung of premodern Indian society.

That modern enthusiasts and lovers of Sanskrit have so many classical Sanskrit verses available to them for their enlightement and pleasure is thanks to the efforts of well informed, cultured and ecumenical compilers of Sanskrit poetry like Vidayakara and Shridharadasa.

Shridharadasa's Saduktikarnamrita is the second anthology of Sanskrit verses compiled in ancient Bengal, the first being Vidyakara's Subhashita-Ratna-Kosha. Whereas Vidyakara's anthology contains 1738 verses, the precise number of verses quoted in Saduktikarnamrta is 2380. 623 stanzas find a place in both anthologies.

The titles of the five pravaahas are:

1.  अमर प्रवाह Amara-Pravaaha deals with gods. Over 475 verses are
    devoted to Brahmanical deities

2.  शृंगार प्रवाह Shringaara-Pravaaha covers themes of love and lovers
    and descriptions of different seasons

3.  चाटु प्रवाह Chaatu-Pravaaha describes flattery of various types

4.  अपदेश प्रवाह Apadesha-Pravaaha has miscellaneous themes dealing with
    deities such as Vasudeva, Mahadeva, geographical features like the
    ocean, rivers, gems, flora and fauna

5.  उच्चावच प्रवाह Ucchaavacha-Pravaaha contains verses on poets,
    poetry, illustrious men, poor men and the stages of life

Shridharadasa's sources of compilation are the Sanskrit poetry of classical authors like Kalidasa, Bana, Bhavabhuti, Amaru, Rajashekhara as well as many Bengali authors, some of whom were his contemporaries. He quotes poets such as Yogeshvara, Shatananda, Abhinanda, Dharanidhara, Varaha, Achala, Vallana, Manovinoda, Subhanka, Chakrapani and Laksmidhara, all probably Bengali poets or at least easterners of the Pala kingdom, the core of which comprised Bengal and Bihar. Some of these poets were from the so-called 'rustic school of poetry'. Shridharadasa also quotes verses of some well-known poets like Jayadeva, Umapatidhara, Sharana, Dhoyi and Govardhana - all Sena court poets.

Shridharadasa also draws from verses of the royal poets Vallalasena, Laksmanasena and Keshavasena. King Lakshmanasena was his family patron.

During the period of Sena rule in Bengal, (c 1097-1225 AD), the cultivation of Sanskrit language and literature reached its peak.

Shridharadasa compiled the anthology mainly to provide the common people with literary works which would serve them with means of relaxation and would suit varying moods and tastes. They could also benefit from the age-old wisdom embodied in some of the verses.

These verses are beautifully translated into Hindi by Radhavallabh Tripathi, one of the leading Sanskritists of modern India.
