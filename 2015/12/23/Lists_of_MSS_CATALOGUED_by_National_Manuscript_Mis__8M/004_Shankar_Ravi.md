Dear Dr. Patel,  
  

I appreciate the good work in sharing such valuable information with the group.  
  

I am interested in the MS SQL server db files of the catalog. I am currently trying to merge the files into one file. So, a sql server file is easier engine to import or convert.  
  
  

Could you send me a link to the catalog db file.  
  
  

Best Regards,  
  

Shankar Iyer.
