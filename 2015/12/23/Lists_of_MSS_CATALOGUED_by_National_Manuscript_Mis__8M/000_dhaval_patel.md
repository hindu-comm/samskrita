Notes -  

1\. The original files I received from NMM were in form of MS SQL server database backup files. If anyone wants to access these database backup files, please let me know.  

2\. I tried to merge the five excel files into one, but their sheer size made my computer freeze. If someone with a higher computing capacities can merge them in one and provide, it would be great resource.  

3\. Any kind of query regarding data is welcome.
