Good Dr,

  

 Re *phiṭ-sūtra-vṛtti*

*

Where are you searching, and what are you searching for?

  

Google UK alone, returns 1,380 results withjust*phiTsUtras.*

  

 https://[www.google.co.uk](http://www.google.co.uk)

  

And then there's such as 'vedic accents nlp'

  

which yields, adhika**:**

 'Proceedings of the Second Regional Workshop on Computer Processing of Asian Languages'.

  

  

Regards,

  

 Rivers
