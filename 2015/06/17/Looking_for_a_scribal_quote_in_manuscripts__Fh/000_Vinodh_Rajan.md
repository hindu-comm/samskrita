Hi,

  

I am looking for a Sanskrit quote which is appended to the end of manuscripts by some copying scribes.

  

It goes something like "I'm sorry for any mistakes like missing bindus, illegible aksharas. They are the work of a hasty hand. I've copied the work faithfully without attempting to correct any errors there in".

  

Any help would be appreciated.

  

Cheers,

  

Vinodh Rajan
