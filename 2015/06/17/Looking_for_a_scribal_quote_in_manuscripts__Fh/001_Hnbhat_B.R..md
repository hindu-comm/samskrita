विसर्गबिन्दुमात्राणिपदपादाक्षराणि च । न्यूनानि चातिरिक्तानि क्षमस्व पुरुषोत्तम् ॥

  

It differs from scribe to scribe and it is not considered as part of the work. It sometimes contains the remark about the information about the date and/or the name of the copyist, and sometimes the place where it was copied.Right now I could not remember the verse you have quoted.

  

It could be changing the last pada of the verse.
