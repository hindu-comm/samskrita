Somewhat on a humorous note, there is a comparatively recently acquired but commonly used Marathi saying that describes a mindless blind copying of something...

  

A copyist did his work so well that it could be calledकॉपी टु कॉपी,माशी टु माशी. In copying something, he came across a dead fly stuck to the original page, so in his copy he also drew a picture of a dead fly.
