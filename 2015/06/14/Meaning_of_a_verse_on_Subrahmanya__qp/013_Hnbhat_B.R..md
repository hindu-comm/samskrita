As I have given the meaning and the suffix, according to the first etymology given Apte' dictionary. from the root रुचि + रा + क . The derivation from उणादि suffix किरच् does not need the first explanation which is derived in compound with the word रुचि with the the कृदन्त form र deivex from the root रा दाने with the कृत् suffix क. T

The derivation with उणादि किरच् given in Apte's dictionary does not need the first explanation and it is derived from directly from the verb as you have given:

रुच् + किरच् -- रुचिर. And here there is not the word रुचि at all and no verb रा = दाने. So the explanation given first is not related with the Unadi suffix it gives. Here the explanation would be रोचते इति रुचिरम्। meaning shining primarily as derived from the verb रुच दीप्तौ. So the quotation from Apte' S dictionary is again misleading in so far derivation at least here.

Anyway it is not ईयर् प्रत्यय as you had given,
