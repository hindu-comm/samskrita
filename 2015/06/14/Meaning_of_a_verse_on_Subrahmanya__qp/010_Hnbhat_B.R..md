Please don't offer your conjectured etymology and a suffix.

The above explanation is simply wrong which would give a word रुचीय and not the word रुचिर. Here is the derivation given by वाचस्पत्य lexicon:

रुचिर¦त्रि० रुचिं राति ददाति रा--क । १ मनोहरे सुन्दरे  
१ मधुरे च अमरः । २ मूलके ३ कुङ्कुमे ४ लवङ्गे च न०  
५ गोरोचनायां स्त्री राजनि० ।

with its possible meaning. First of the meaning it gives is beautiful. The others are additional meanings in usage in different contexts.

I am not going to comment on your other interpretations as I have already given mine in my posts.
