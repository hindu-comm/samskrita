A simpler etymology is given at <http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.5.apte.147504> in the online Apte's dictionary -  
रुचिर *a.* \[रुचिं राति ददाति रुच्-किरच् Uṇ.1.5\] **  
**So, this etymology relates रुचिर to रुच् धातुः and it becomes रुचिर with किरच् इति उणादि प्रत्ययः \|  
  
Along with simpler etymology**,** the meanings are also given in Apte's dictionary as - **  
  
1** Bright, shining, brilliant, radiant; हेमरुचिराम्बर Ch. P.14; कनकरुचिरम्, रत्नरुचिरम् &c. **-3** Tasteful, palatable. **-4** Sweet, dainty. **-5** Stomachic, exciting appetite. **-6** Cordial, restorative. **-7** Pleasant, pleased (प्रसन्न); अथ वासवस्य वचनेन रुचिरवदनत्रिलोचनम् Ki.12.1.  
  
Basically what I admitted in my previous post was admitting that I had erred in splitting रुचिरकलापे as रुचिः अकलापे I should have thought of and focused on रुचिर being the component word not रुचिः.  
  
It is your privilege whether to comment on my interpretations or not. But the basic query does seek, why the poet is seeing Kumaraswamy NOT on his peacock. I have attempted some reasoning.
