Abhyankarji,  

  

Thank you very much for explaining the verse. I am still doubtful about the meaning of the 3rd line. I guess you meant 'plume' in place of 'flume'.  

  

I would like to know if there is an alternate meaning for न तु रुचिर कलापे वर्तते यो मयूरे (i.e. other than "He, who has no taste in a peacock without a plume"



regards  
shankara
