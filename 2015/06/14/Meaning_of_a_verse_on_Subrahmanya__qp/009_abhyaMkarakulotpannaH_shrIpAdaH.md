I was wrong in splitting रुचिरकलापे as रुचिः अकलापे  

Dr. Bhat's explanation of रुचिरकलापे = रुचिरः कलापः --> तस्मिन् is excellent. रुचिर is तद्धितं विशेषणम् \| रुचि + ईयर् (ईयर्-प्रत्ययेन "अस्य अस्ति" इत्यर्थकं विशेषणम्) \|  

  
I think the poet's idea of mentioning Kumar not being on his usual carrier the peacock with beautiful (tasteful) plume, is to bring forth, rather emphasize His संयम in the midst of a flock of eyes of celestial ladies, all of which are like blue lotuses. The mention of संयम sort of prefaces why the poet seeks in this verse Kumar to devolve ब्रह्मचर्यश्रीः. It seems that संयम is the key word.  

There is also some challenge in deciphering the word विकसदमरनारीनेत्रनीलाब्जषण्डानि. षण्डानि = flock. The challenge is षण्डानि of what - of eyes or of lotuses ?  
  

Also the word संयमाधःकृतानि is adjectival to विकसदमरनारीनेत्रनीलाब्जषण्डानि. One can say that Kumar's ब्रह्मचर्यश्रीः is so imposing that blue lotus-like softly (enticingly) opening eyes of even celestial ladies are forced to be संयमाधःकृतानि.  
  

That brings to mind a convention in Maharashtra (and may be also in North Karnataka) that ladies are not supposed to go to Kumara (Kartikaswamy) temple. In Pune on Parvati Hill there is a temple of Kartikaswamy. No ladies go to that temple. They do visit other temples in that complex, but not the Kartikaswamy temple.
