न तु यो रुचिरकलापे मयूरे वर्तते =

and not who is not seated in the peacock having the beautiful feather of tail (esp.of a peacock) (which is the usual carrier of कुमार)

will be proper translation in the context.

This adjectival is in contrast with the previous one seated amidst the host of blossoming blue lotuses (lilies) formed of the eyes of celestial maids attracted towards him.
