It is not the one you had given. तस्मिन् is excellent. रुचिर is \| रुचि + ईयर् (ईयर्-प्रत्ययेन "अस्य अस्ति" इत्यर्थकं विशेषणम्) \|

I objected the above etymology given by you as the taddhita suffix.  

रुचि + ईयर् (ईयर्-प्रत्ययेन "अस्य अस्ति" इत्यर्थकं विशेषणम्) \|

There is no such thing taddhita suffix as ईयर् and even if there, any of would not yield the form रुचिर.

This does not mean there is no other meaning or other derivation and I gave one as given in Vacaspatyam dictionary रुचि + रा + क a compound of ruci + ra a kridanta formation. giving the वृत्ति as रुचिं ददाति रुचि derived from the root रुच दीप्तौ रुच् + कि -- रुच्+इ = रुचि.
