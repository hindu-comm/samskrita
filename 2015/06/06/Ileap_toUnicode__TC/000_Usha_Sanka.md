Namaste

Here is the process which will help to convert Ileap to Unicode.

Sharing, as I thought it will be helpful for many.

(Pl. ignore if already aware)  

# Ileap Documents to Unicode Conversion

 inXP

\-

It is two step process-

1\. Activate Unicode in Windows system.

2\. Then convert the Ileap file.



First -- Activating Unicode in Windows system—

In absence of XP Installable CD, you can get required files here-

Converting the Ileap file— (provided Ileap is installed in the system, and file for conversion can be opened in Ileap)

1. Open the Ileap file.

2. Go to File \> Export

3. A dialogue box appears. At “File Name”- \*.aci;\*.txt – this appears. Replace the star with file name you want to save the file with.

4. File Name should not exceed 8 letters. Otherwise, it says “The above file name is invalid.” Just shorten the name. \[Later after it becomes Unicode Word file, we can change it to long name if needed.\]

5. Remove “;.txt” part. Just keep .aci

6. Under “Directories”, select a location to save the file. Select it from “Drives” below. And the folders (directories) in that drive appear in the above box. Select preferably D:/ or E:/ because it is easy to handle and locate file for new users.

7. At “Export Files of type”, select from the drop down menu, “ASCII text” which falls last in the list.

8. Do not tick Break Paragraph at End of line. Leave it.

9. Then click “Export”.

10. Then go to the location where file is saved. For Eg. D:/.

11. You will find an ileap file with name you gave, there. Right click and choose “Open with” MS Word.

12. Or Right click, choose “Properties” and change at “Opens with”. Then choose Microsoft Office Word. Then say apply and OK.

13. It opens with MS Word. And there is a dialogue box given with “File Conversion,

(

with file name

)

.”

14. Choose “Other Encoding” and then the side box options are highlighted. Choose “ISCII Telugu” if it is a Telugu file in Ileap. “ISCII Devanagari” if Samskrt file. The characters appear in the same language script of the ileap file.

Then say OK. The MS Word doc is opened with Unicode characters.
