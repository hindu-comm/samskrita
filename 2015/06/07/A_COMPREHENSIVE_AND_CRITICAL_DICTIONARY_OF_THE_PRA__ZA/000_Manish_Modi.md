It was felt for a long time that there was no comprehensive and critical dictionary of Prakrit. Such a dictionary would not only promote the study of Prakrit, but also help and promote Jain studies. Knowing the rather step-motherly approach of the government and educational institutions towards Prakrit, the Jain community came forward to support this project. NK Firodia took the initiative and entrusted this work to Prof AM Ghatage who had retired as the Chief Editor of the Sanskrit Dictionary Project of the Deccan College PostGraduate and Research Institute in Pune. The work was located at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute because of its reputation as the foremost Institute in the field of Indological studies, and also because of its excellent library & press facility.

  

A detailed plan of the proposed dictionary indicating the nature & scope of the work, the method to be adapted for its implementation, the problems involved in it, and other relevant matters was prepared and circulated amongst Indian and foreign scholars of Prakrit and their suggestions invited. These suggestions were incorporated.

  

This has resulted in the best, most comprehensive and exhaustively researched Prakrit dictionary. The Prakrit word is typed in Devanagari and Roman. Then, a Sanskrit synonym for the Prakrit word is given in Roman. This is followed by an exhaustive English explanation of the Prakrit term along with relevant quotation(s) in Prakrit, each of which has been cited accurately. The dictionary follows the highest academic standards. Unfortunately, the process is extremely slow. And after so many years, we have only come up to the vowel ‘ओ’ (‘o’). However, it is the best dictionary available in the market so far, for the academically inclined. We hope that the rest of the dictionary will proceed more rapidly.

  

Like other works of similar nature, the dictionary is being published in fascicule form. As booksellers, we prefer to sell only the hardcover volumes. So we sell the first four volumes, which have been printed in hardcover. However, we can make fascicules available on request.
