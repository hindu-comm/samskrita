It is not Mr. Ramakrishnan but Mr. Rajam Srinivasan who vitiated the flow of the thread.  

  
Mr. Ramakrishnan started the thread based on information available with him.  
  

People can add information what is available with them or raise questions arising. But nothing should be said, which can cause hurt.  
  

Dr. Dhaval Patel pointing out and Dr. Bhat endorsing it will only lengthen the thread. There has to be some thought as to how the wrong flow of the thread can be set right.  
  

Can the moderator look into this ?
