Dear Mr. Ramakrishnan,  
  

Since you have mentioned some comparison between words in Tamil and Kannada, I am also curious about the following -  

  
(1) Kannada - Hogu Tamil - Pogu, Kannada - Haalu, Tamil - Paalu Kannada - hiDi (= catch), Tamil - piDi What can be the logic Kannada has consonant 'h' in place of 'p' in Tamil ?  

  
(2) Could it be that Bengaluru is derived from Pengal ooru (place where ladies were dominant ?) I think, पबयोरभेदः is well-understandable, especially because Tamil has same letter for 'p' and 'b'.  
  
(3) There has also been वबयोरभेदः The British spelt Vijapur as Bijapur.  
  

\(4\) From the history and etymology, you have given, language in Kerala during the time of those three kingdoms was Tamil.  
  

\(5\) From what I know, Telugu, Kannada and Malyalam scripts are much richer than Tamil. Maybe people in respective regions thought it good to have richer scripts and also ended up cultivating their own languages.

  

सस्नेहम्
