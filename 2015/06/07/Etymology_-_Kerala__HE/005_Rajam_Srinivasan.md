In our school-days we were informed that BegaLuuru is derived from "benda kaaLuuru." -- the city (uuru) of cooked (benda) kaaLU (the seeds), with the following explanatary story: -- When PaaNDavaas were banished, Kauravaas occasionally tried to make their lives more miserable by mocking them in some way or other. One time a messenger was sent with the "seeds" to be sown for growing food. Only problem?
The seeds were already cooked and dried:(( The "benda kaaLu" -- the cooked seed were fed to the birds by formidable Draupadi. The birds swallowed the seeds. When the very same seeds were ejected by the birds on the ground through their excreta, Lo and Behold!! they germinated and sprouted and grew up to be food plants:)) Needless to say that this and similar stories delighted the children to no end!

  

Even now Draupadi is as revered as any Goddess. She is worshipped in her own temples on a regular basis. She is worshipped in the fields,and offered prayers for good harvest. In fact, the famous B'lore "karaga - festival" is in honor of Draupadi and Dharmaraja. In Melkote (Thiru Narayana Pura) an ancient pilgrim center near B'lore has a network of caves known as "PaaNDava" caves. That area is replete with topographical sites reminding us of Mahabharata and also Raamaayana.

  

It is narrated that VibhishaNa of Ramaayana gifted "iron" to the people around here as a token of his appreciation of their help to him.
unfortunately, I don't recall the details. But the word for "iron" is also connected with the name of the city.

  

About the shortened script of Tamil in terms of "vargiiya-vyanjanaas" -- the classified consonants (the classes being ka, cha, Ta, tha, pa vargas) there are two different narratives. 1. The following story (I don't know if it could be considered a theory) is that the Tamilians' auditory capacity is so poor that they cannot discern the minute difference between "mahaa-praaNa and alpa praaNa --( ka and KHa) and structural integrity of their jaws is not efficient enough to make difference in pronounciation of ka and ga! 2. The second story is :--
The Tamilians trace their origin to the most ancient times ("khaNDam period" -- I really don't know what it is) which has enabled them to understand most precisely all that is intended even without any differentiation between k and KHA, and between ka and ga -- a kind of synesthetic (?) ability!! "Kabir's NirguNa Brahma" becomes "gabirs NirKuNA Prama"! If non-Tamilians can't figure them out, it is too bad, it is their problem:)) Afterall who else but Tamilians were the favorites of Great Agastya muni? (Sorry, Great Akasdyar?)
