I too agree with Dhaval's opinion as the silly remark by Ramakrishnan has gone away from its object which is obvious to the speakers of dDravidian languages, if they have studied linguistic development according historical lingistcs or comparative Dravidian linguists or speakers of any other Dravidian language than their mother tongue or native language language.

Instead this thread is dwindling away in the wrong way.
