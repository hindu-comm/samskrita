It's to my regret that utter rubbish is being purveyed in this group the name of etymology. The recent post by Rajam Srinivasan of course takes the cake. Greats like Tilak and Gokhale used to pronounce 'f' and 'z' as 'ph' and 'j'. Perhaps Rajam Srinivasan thinks their hearing was impaired too. Perhaps Ms/Mr Rajam Srinivasan would submit an audio recording of her/his English and let's submit it to an English accent expert. The resulting report would be interesting, to say the least.  
  

The thread started so inauspiciously with PK Ramakrishnan sending some absurd stuff about the word Kerala having come from coconut. For god's sake read some books. If you can't, don't write. How come people think that what passes for expertise in some chest thumping Brahmin forums can pass muster in a forum that seeks to discuss Sanskrit?  
  

Re origin of the term 'Kerala', please read Asoka's use of the term 'Keralaputo', the Tamil Classics' use of the term 'cēramān' and start drawing some conclusions there.  
  

One can of course overlook ignorance but not utter bilge of the type spewed by Rajam Srinivasan. I'm not even sure if this person has read any Tamil grammar and how the grammar treatises spell out how Sanskrit words are to be Tamilized (rendered into tatsama and tadbhava words) .
In the absence of such knowledge, Rajam Srinivasan's posts on this thread need to be considered 'mentally impaired'.  
  

Utterly disgusted,
