Sirs,

  

According to Sheldon Pollock in 'The Language of the Gods in the World of Men',

The first extant literary work in Kannada, Pampa’s *Bhratam,* also titled the

*VikramArjunavijayam *(Arjuna’s Victory of Power, c. 950). Within a couple of generations, Ranna produced his *Sahasabhimavijayam.* The first dictionary, only fragmentarily preserved, is the so called *‘Rannanighantu’* (c.990) ascribed to Ranna, emperor-poet to the Kings of Kalyana Chalukya Dynasty.

With respects

R Subrahmanian
