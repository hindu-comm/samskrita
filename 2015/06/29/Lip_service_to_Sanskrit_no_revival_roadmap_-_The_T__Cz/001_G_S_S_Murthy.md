I read the referred article in Telegraph. Even the article misses an important aspect of Sanskrit studies. That is to raise Sanskrit from the status of a dead classical language to that of a dynamic vibrant living language. There is so much that can be done in this direction. For example:

1 Creating dictionaries between every Indian language and Sanskrit.

2.Translating good literature from other Indian languages and English to Sanskrit

3\. Encouraging creation of a corpus of popular science in Sanskrit.

4 .Developing a Seventh Darsana of Science.

5\. Encouraging every type of new writing in Sanskrit

6\. Providing a set of text books in Sanskrit up to graduation in all modern subjects.

7\. Creating and standardizing modern vocabulary in Sanskrit.

Although there are umpteen Sanskrit universities (regular or deemed), I wonder if anything is being done in any of them in the areas given above.

Regards,

Murthy
