Manish,

  

  

Despite the name, it appears to be jut a mantra.

  

It is referred to in a book from Oxford University Press that I have, in connection with the KsU and its origins in the Vedas.

  

Here it is as a pdf, (Roman transliteration & meaning in English) with links to audio files.

I'll leave the Devanagari searching to your good self.
