Thanks to all the members who responded on and off the list, your comments helped me improve the Transliteration Key. I separated the Sanskrit and Standard Hindi pronunciation ofऐ and औ to make it easier to understand. The book has been published recently, and the Transliteration Key used can be seen in the book preview:

as well as in the free sample pages

The book is available for purchase from Amazon India [here](http://www.amazon.in/dp/819311440X).
