I admit, and apologize, for not having read any of the standards that you are referring to. In my perspective, usually, these are written by folks who figure out things in their heads and sometimes with little connection to the "earth / ground". By no means, do I mean any disrespect to them.

  

Yes, the standards may be right in specifying that "go" and "ghost" start with the same sound, but I haven't found one normal speaking person in my life who pronounces "ghost" as "gost", or, "goat" as "ghoat", nor one who has not pronounced "थ" for "bath", "thought" or "thunder". I have no idea of what a "voiced dental fricative" or "voiced aspirated dental consonant" is, but havealways heard "the" / "thee" pronounced with the sound "ध".Ditto with all the other sounds that I have mentioned.

  
I have lived half my life in India, and half in US and have heard English on both the lands, from a lot of different races. I have no credentials to support my claim. Ergo, it might be difficult for you to just take someone's observations and put all your handwork at stake.  
  
Above all, it is your book and your hardwork, and you should select appropriately, depending on your audience.
