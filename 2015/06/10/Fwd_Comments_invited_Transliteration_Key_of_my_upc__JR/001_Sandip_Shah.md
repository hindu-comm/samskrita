For EN  

  

ऌ - I have heard both "rul" and "lr" - don't know which one is correct, but something like "curl" may work.

ऐ - no option  

औ - like in "out" but replace the initial "ā" sound with "a".  

  

घ - "ghost".

छ - no option ... people will pronounce "hitch-hike". You have most likely done a dictionary search for words like this ... us, Indians, know how to pronounce this and we write it as "chh", and you have probably looked for words which have a "chh" in them ... but that is of no use. There is no sound "chh" in EN and when people read that, they split it into "ch-h". You are going to run into this issue with other sounds too.

th -थ - just "bath", or "thought", or "thunder" should suffice.

ठ - no matter what you do, it will be difficult - people will pronounce it as "guest-house".

ण - no option

ध - "the" should work

न - "No" should work ... no need for a difficult / long word, I think.

फ, भ - no option

My kids always make fun of me when I say a word with a "v" or a "w" ... there are two separate pronunciations, and I cannot tell one from theother.

स - "sun" or "son".
