Thanks, two comments

  

1\) My book has transliteration of both Hindi (Awadhi to be presicse) and Sanskrit text. In Standard Hindi, ऐ and औ are indeed pronounced as the vowels in mat (IPA /æ/) and dot (IPA /ɔː/) respectively. To make this clear, I have described the Standard Hindi and Sanskrit pronunciations separately in different lines. I will be sharing the updated key shortly.

  

2\) As for aɪ/āɪ and aʊ/āʊ, Sanskrit ऐ and औ are closer to the former ones but not exactly the same. In /āɪ/ and /āʊ/ the first vowel sound is longer than the second. In /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ they are almost of the same length. In Sanskrit, the first vowel of the diphthong is traditionally described as having a temporal length which is one-third of the second vowel. So the first vowel in the diphthong is half a mora, the second is one and a half moras. This is confirmed by the following references:

  

A\) Kātyāyana's Vārttika on PS 1.1.48 states **aicoḥ ca uttarabhūyastvāt**

On which Patañjali says in the Mahābhāṣya  

*aicoḥ ca uttarabhūyastvāt avarṇaḥ na bhaviṣyati  
*

*bhūyasī mātrā ivarṇovarṇayoḥ alpīyasī avarṇasya*

*bhūyasaḥ eva grahaṇāni bhaviṣyanti*

*tat yathā brāhmaṇagrāmaḥ ānīyatām iti ucyate tatra ca avarataḥ pañcakārukī bhavati*

bhūyasī = one and a half moras  

alpīyasī = half mora

  

B\) Taittirīya prātiśākhya

**2.26 akārārdhamaikāraukārayorādiḥ  
**

**2.27 saṃvṛtakaraṇataramekeṣām**

**2.28 ikāro'dhyardhaḥ pūrvasya śeṣaḥ**

*The beginning of ai and au is half an a.  
*

*Which, in the opinion of some, is uttered with the organs more closed.*

*Of the former, the rest is one and a half times i*

  

C\) Commentaries by Uvaṭa and Anantabhaṭṭa Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya 1.73 also say the same. Note that as per these commentaries on Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya, the pronunciation of ऐ and औ are ae and ao respectively, i.e. the second part of the vowel is ए or ओ, and not इ or उ as stated in Taittirīya Prātiśākhya 2.28. However, this is limited to the Vedic tradition following the Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya (which is my family's tradition).
