# A Practical Sanskrit Introductory by Charles Wikner will be a seriously useful resource. 

  

He describes how totwistand turn the tongue toPronounceऋ .One possiblecandidateis the way a Mexican would speak a popular first name "Guerrero"...

  

Forङ , there is a candidate in Vietnamese... They have verypopular
last name "Nguen". Thatpronunciationfits good.

  

I am not sure you would like to use them as examples or not..

  

  

Many languages just do not have some phonemes. Most famous examples are lack of equivalent of "L" in Japanese or equivalent of "J" in Spanish.

  

Less known, but most startling example is Hawaiian (and possibly other related Polynesian languages) Hawaiian set of Vowels and consonants is limited toThe current official Hawaiian alphabet consists of thirteen letters: five vowels (Aa, Ee, Ii, Oo, Uu) and eight consonants (Hh, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Pp, Ww,ʻokina).( No s, t, b, j, g, gh, r, d, dh and so on so forth ??? Are you serious?? )

  

We may not be having many phonemes in African languages.. They have names like Mbeki
