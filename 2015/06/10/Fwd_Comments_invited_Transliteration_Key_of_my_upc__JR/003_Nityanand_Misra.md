As per Oxford, Cambridge, Macmillan, Collins, and Longman dictionaries, in both American and British English (Received Pronunciation), the initial consonant sound in "ghost" (IPA /gəʊst/ BrE, /ɡoʊst/ AmE) and "go" (IPA /gəʊ/ BrE, /ɡoʊ/ AmE) are the same. So if I cite the word "ghost" for घ then it would be no different from ग. Can you please cite a *published source*(no anecdotal evidence or "I have heard somebody say it this way")which gives a different pronunciation of the initial consonant in the words "go" and "ghost" in AmE or BrE (RP)? (Some Indians may pronounce it asघ, but I do not have a standard reference for Indian English pronunciation).

I wish writing standard books was that easy (search in a dictionary or on the web and blindly copy and paste). It is not, at least if the publishing standard is high, which is the case for my book. So for me, the guiding light is नामूलं लिख्यते किंचिन्नानपेक्षितमुच्यते for everything, including the Transliteration Key.

  

There is no word in English with the exact pronunciation of the aspirated consonant. Hence, I use the word "like". Most standard transliteration keys have similar approximating examples like these for aspirated consonants. You can see one [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=dKYfdbxnukkC&pg=PA1117). And by the way, even the exact word "hitchhike" is indeed cited as an approximate example forछ onpage 191 of Buddha and Buddhism (Harper: 1957, English translation of Maurice Percheron's French book by Edmund Stapleton).

It would not. Pronouncing these words with the aspirated voiceless alveolar stop (IPA t̪ʰ) is the Indian English pronunciation. That is not how it is pronounced in American English or British English (Received Pronunciation), where the "th" sound for these words is the voiceless dental fricative (IPA /θ/). You may refer any of the dictionaries I cited above (Oxford, Cambridge, Macmillan, Longman, or Collins). My book is intended for a global audience, hence I would rather not have examples from Indian English but would rather stick to AmE and BrE (RP).

See comment onछ above.

Hence the word "Like" before "bent" (IPA /bɛnt/). In AmE and BrE these words are pronounced withalveloar nasal (IPA /n/).

It will not, as the consonant sound in "the" (IPA /ðiː/ or /ðə/) is thevoiced dental fricative, not the voiced aspirated dental consonant whichध (IPA/d̪ʱ/) is. Again refer any standard dictionary.

It will not. In American and British English, "no" is pronounced with the alveloar nasal (IPA /n/), whereasन is the dental nasal (IPA /n̪/). Only when n is followed by the voiced dental fricative (IPA/ð/) or thevoiceless dental fricative (IPA /θ/), it is pronounced as the dental nasal. Examples are "month", "plinth".

And hence, "Like"

Same as "see" and "yes".
