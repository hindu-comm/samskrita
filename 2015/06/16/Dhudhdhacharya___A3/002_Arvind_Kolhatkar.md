It has been mentioned[on this webpage](http://mr.upakram.org/node/3616)that the well-known historian of yesteryears, V.K.Rajwade, has written that दोढ्ढाचार्य = दोग्धृ + आचार्य. Here दोग्धृ means a person who 'crafts'काव्य for a fee, in other words, a person who pretends to be a poet but is, in reality, a hack writer. (I cannot say where V.K.Rajwade said this.) 

  

The same webpage hasearliermentioned the same meaning as that given by SLA above.
