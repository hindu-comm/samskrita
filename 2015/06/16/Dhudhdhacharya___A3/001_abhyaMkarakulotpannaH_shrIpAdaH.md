दुड्डाचार्य् or दोड्डाचार्य्may be a Kannada-word.

In Kannada दोड्ड means older or elderly or big. And आचार्य seems to have been adopted or assimilated in Kannada from Sanskrit.

With meaning of दोड्ड as above word of दोड्डाचार्य् becomes the final word. In turn दोड्डाचार्य् may be idiomatically used to mean an adamant person. Literally however it means 'a highly placed person, whose word is to be taken as final.

  

The wordदोड्डाचार्य् would have come into Marathi with the intermingle of the two languages, which is rampant in the regions bordering Maharashtra and Karnataka. Before independence, there were many princely states in that region, whose princes were Marathi-speaking, but the local language is/was Kannada. Up to SSC I had my schooling in one such place Jamkhandi.

  

Our geography teacher's surname wasदोड्डवाड (literal meaning 'the family which has a big house').
