Thanks a lot Arvind !   
I am aware of my "newbieness/newbietvA" in Sanskrit and these comments are helping me realize my mistakes :)  
  
About पूर्णसङ्कुलमनये, I was meaning to say: Full (pURna) with confusion (saNkulam) in my mind (manaye)  
About विस्तारपक्षमेन अहं बोद्धामि. I was meaning to say: Using my spread wings (I tried to use the instrumental case), now I see/understand(boddhAmi).

  

About devanagari... I don't understand why other Sanskrit enthusiasts refuse to learn it. I know it may seem like a burden at the beginning, but it's just a matter of getting past that barrier. It becomes natural after a while. I find it very useful, actually.  
  
I do encourage everyone to break the "it's stupid/pointless/too hard" mental circuit and to just start getting used to it until it feels natural. Also, there isn't a romanized transliteration for all of the Sanskrit literature, so we might as well just learn devanagari to get access to them ;)  

  

I think we Westerns are afraid of it at the beginning because it looks very very different from our letters. I see the transliterated romanized versions of devanagari texts just like crutches or like the small extra wheels in bicycles, very very useful as a transition, but they aren't meant to be used forever !

  

I'll take in account all these comments and I'll continue practicing in order to get better.  
I am sure that I will eventually acquire the skill to produce good-quality poems :)  
  
Saludos.
