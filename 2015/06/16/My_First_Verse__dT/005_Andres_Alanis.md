नमस्ते Abhyankar-महोदय  
  
मम नाम अन्द्रेस् (Andrés) अस्ति  
अहं Mexican अस्मि \| सलुदोस् =नमस्ते / Cheers! मम भाषे (Saludos means cheers! in spanish).  
  
Yes! I'm glad my idea gets conveyed, although with some minor details.  
My original intention was:  
  
Before, I was like a caged animal.  
Before, I lived with my mind fully confused (full with confusion)  
Now I fly (upwards) like a liberated bird  
Now, thanks to my spreaded/opened wings, I "see/understand" (बोद्धामि)  
  
  
Saludos.
