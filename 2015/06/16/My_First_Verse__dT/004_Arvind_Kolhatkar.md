पूर्वं कारास्थपशुमिव अहं अभवम्  
पूर्वं पूर्णसङ्कुलमनये अहं अवसम्  
इदानीम् निर्मुक्तविहगमिव अहं उत्पतामि  
इदानीम्विस्तारपक्षमेन अहं बोद्धामि  
  

A few suggestions:

  

पूर्वं कारास्थपशुमिव अहं अभवम्  

  

कारा is 'prison' and that for humans. A पशु 'animal' is not kept in prison. The animal is confined or restrained by being tied by a rope.
A word likeरज्जु or दामन्, combined with बद्ध will be appropriate.
पशुमिव (पशुं इव) अहम् is not good grammar as पशु is masculine. पशुरिव (पशु: इव) अहम् is correct. Same about line 3 निर्मुक्तविहगमिव

  

What is पूर्णसङ्कुलमनये? I cannot make out its meaning. The same about विस्तारपक्षमेन अहं बोद्धामि.

  

Sanskrit, at least its classical variety, does not know 'blank verse'.. Every piece of poetry has to be fitted in one of the prescribed meters of prosody. At the same time, a verse does not need to be rhymed at the end. That freedom is given to the composer of the verse.

  

Congratulations to you for making the effort to learn to read and write Devanagari, unlike some other Western students. They are so mortified of Devanagari that they would wish to have everything served up to them in Romanized transliteration.
