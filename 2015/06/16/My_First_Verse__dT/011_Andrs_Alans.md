नमस्काराः  
  
Thanks for the feedback,  
I've been learning from these comments. I am aware that although I still have a long way to go,  
I'll eventually get the skill to create Sanskrit poems.  
  
Unfortunately, it's not very common for Mexicans to have interest in learning Sanskrit. The closest they get is learning yoga asanas (most of the time without paying interest to the root meaning). We've been having an increase in these "new-age/meditation/buddhism/yoga/spirituality" culture in my city but the idea of Sanskrit as a language hasn't been reinforced enough. Most people would automatically say: "Sanskrit? Isn't it an extinct old language?" :(  
  
I had certain life experiences that inclined me towards Buddhism and spirituality in general, that’s how it all began with me.  
That, combined with my longtime affection for Linguistics/Languages gave me the motivation enough to decide to learn Sanskrit (deep texts) .  
Unfortunately, this is not very common in Mexico. I only got 2 friends interested in learning it, no more.  
  
Saludos
