Saludos ! Andrés-महोदय !  
Saludos is same as नमस्ते, right ?  
Your verse says, "you are free of confusions".  
Irony it is that I confused myself :-( !  
May I suggest to you  

-   to work with simpler words, e.g. पञ्जरम् instead of कारा, -   आसम् could be better than अभवम् to say "I was" -   मुग्धमनाः could be better than पूर्णसङ्कुलमनये -   बोद्धामि is incorrect and unduly harsh, because of conjoint
    consonant. बोधामि is simple and correct form. -   Would not उड्डयामि better than उत्पतामि ?  

I think composing a verse would require making a good choice of words. In Sanskrit there are many synonymous words. Sanskrit verses are special, also for the choice of words.  
  
I definitely sense a poetic inspiration in your composing the verse ! That's great !  
  
In fact your verse arouses a curiosity in me to know what the status is in Mexico for people to learn Sanskrit.
