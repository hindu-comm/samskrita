Please bear in mind the following points and review yourself the verse:

1\. The nouns in collocation with the indeclinable इव needs the noun in nominative according to the subject with intransitive verbs.

2\. The nouns in Sanskrit have grammatical gender fixed and only the adjectives participles take gender following the gender of the nouns they qualify.

3\. The words would convey much sense if the most frequent words than the coined words.

So check yourself the genders of the last words and the case and the other cases whether the words convey the same meaning you wanted to convey.
