नमस्ते / Saludos ! Andrés-महोदय !  

To carry further from your mention ".. it's not very common for Mexicans to have interest in learning Sanskrit. .." my curiosity is how you are learning it -  

1.  Do you follow some "Teach Yourself" Book in English / Spanish ? 2.  Do you follow some lessons on the internet ? 3.  Do you go to some school / class teaching Sanskrit ? 4.  Since you have a couple of friends also, do you do group-learning
    ?  

Your inputs will be a good guide for thinking about how people would / should learn Sanskrit in places, where there is no conducive environment  

सस्नेहम्
