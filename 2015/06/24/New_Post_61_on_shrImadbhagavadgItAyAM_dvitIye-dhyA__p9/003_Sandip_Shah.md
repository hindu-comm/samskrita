"Sanskrit can be learned in one's chosen script!"

  

Depends on how much of Sanskrit one intends to learn. What one can learn from "क" is very different than what one can learn from "ca" or "ka".

  

Don't be fooled into thinking that a script is a script is a script ... each character of a script denotes a concept, not just a "sound".
