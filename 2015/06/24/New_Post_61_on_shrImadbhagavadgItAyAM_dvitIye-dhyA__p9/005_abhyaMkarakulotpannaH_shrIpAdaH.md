The discussions are going away from the subject-line and are becoming totally irrelevant to my post about shloka 2-55 of gItA.  
  

The discussions are focusing on the script than the import of the shloka.  
  

My request to the moderator that the subject-line be changed for such comments.  
  

I feel appalled by such comments, giving the impression that I have done something wrong in my study of the shloka itself.
