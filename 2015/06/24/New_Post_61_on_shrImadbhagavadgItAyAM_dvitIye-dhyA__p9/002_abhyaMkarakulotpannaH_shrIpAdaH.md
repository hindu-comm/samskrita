नमस्ते श्रीमन् केन् (Is it okay to address you so ?)-महोदय !  
I am impressed by the effort done by you to script the verse and its पदच्छेद in so many scripts !  
However I wish to also respond to your comment "*We should simplify
Sanskrit through **padachchhedaiḥ* " It is my view-point, that any Sanskrit verse should be first presented as it is. पदच्छेदः should be only the next step. The verse 'as it is' has a metrical rhythm, which gets affected during पदच्छेद. Metrical beauty will be left out if study of a verse starts directly with पदच्छेद. I usually indulge in analysis of the prosody of the verse also, except that majority of verses in गीता are in अनुष्टुभ् or श्लोक-meter. Hence analysis of the prosody repetitively is better avoided.
