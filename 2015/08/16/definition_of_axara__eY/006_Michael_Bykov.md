 thank you, your answers were very helpful and informative.  
  
 so,  
  
 Rk. Pratisakhya  
 सव्यञ्जनः सानुस्वारः शुद्धो वापि स्वरोऽक्षरम् - savyanjanah saanusvaarah suddho vaa svaraha aksharam,  
 which means: "a vowel pure by itself or in association with a consonant or anusvara is aksharam. According to this definition an aksharam can be taken as a single expressible independent speech sound unit and in other words can be called a "syllable". (Dr. R.S. Murty letter in the same thread)  
  
 I have found also:  
  
 R.Pr.5: अनुस्वारो व्यञ्जनं चाक्षराङ्गं स्वरान्तरे व्यञ्जनान्युत्तरस्य -> anusvaro vyaYjana cAksaraYgam . . .  
 i.e. - anusvara and consonant forms part of a syllable  
  
 R.Pr.1.3 : स्वरभक्तिः पूर्वभागक्षराङ्गं द्राघीयसी सार्धमात्रेतरे च -> svarabhaktiH purvaBAgakzarAYgam  
 i.e. - vowel-separation forms previous part a syllable, i.e. vowel breaks flow of a sound, right?  
  
 So, aksara emymologically means "interruption, breaking of a flow (of a sound)".  
  
 And syllable definition could be something like: "consonant or consonant cluster plus vowel. In exactly that order. With only exception: in a syllable vowel can be followed by a consonant only at the end of a word or line".  
  
 If, for example, we break word "arjuna" with modern definition of a syllable, we will get "ar-ju-na", but with traditional definition we will get "a-rju-na".  
  
 This is a fundamental difference, as far as I can see. We should not mix up both definitions of a syllable in one logical conclusion or text. But most western (and Russian) texts about ancient Indian prosody use modern definition when reading and interpreting ancient text based on traditional definition, so they make this mistake.  
  
 Please correct me if I'm wrong
