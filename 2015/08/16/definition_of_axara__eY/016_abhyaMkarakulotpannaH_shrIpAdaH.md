नमांसि !

I am confused by the basic query because

  

1. ".. These meanings or*artha,*are hard to find. I have come to the conclusion, that this is because they aren’t there to find - they never have been clearly defined in the first place. ..."  

-   

    If dictionaries do give meaning or*artha*of words, whydoes one
    say, ".. they aren’t there to find .." ?

    

2. ".. How am, I to understand these arthas, to the extent that I will know one when I see one? ..."  

-   

    To my mind, to understand the*artha,* one needs to see not just the
    word but all its context. The meaning of पदम् is different in
    सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् and different in अगच्छन् वैनतेयोऽपिपदमेकं न गच्छति
    In both instances one sees the word पदम्. Does one not know what
    the*artha*is in one place and what the*artha*is in the other
    place ?
