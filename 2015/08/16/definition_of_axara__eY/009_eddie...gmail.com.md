All,



 Along with etymological study in linguistics, there is also semantics and syntactics.



As regards to Sanskrit semantics or padārtha.

Padārtha in its sense of that which corresponds to the meaning of a word, a thing, ***material object***, man, person, Var. Kāv. Pur.



These meanings or *artha,* are hard to find.

I have come to the conclusion, that this is because they aren’t there to find - they never have been clearly defined in the first place.



Words are lakṣaṇa, marks, signs, symbols, tokens of artha.

But how to connect a lakṣaṇa with its artha, where do I look for its definition(s)?

How am, I to understand these arthas, to the extent that I will know one when I see one?



Examples please, anyone, of the following well known lakṣaṇa, in the context of that masterpiece of exposition\* that is the YS.



 vi-tarka

 vi-cāra



I assume they correlate with

 mahā-bhūta

 sūkṣma



But exactly how do I distinguish my mahā-bhūta from my sūkṣma?



I am to find all these artha, with the confines of my antaḥ-karaṇa, am I not?

And with this manas of mine in its everyday, a-vidya condition.

Now, even though I have actually known my para-puruṣa by means of the praṇava, I have yet to identify what got ‘purified’ from my memory.



Is it thus:

The ‘manifest’ or ‘gross’ being what my eyes see – a stone flying through the air.

The ‘unmanifest’ or ‘fine’ being what the eyes did not see

 - small boys throwing stones in very recent past

or what the eyes are yet to be see, albeit very shortly

 - a glass house and breaking windows?



In the same vein, and in the same context, there are all those vi-bhūti....

On a conversational note.



Those nāma of mine are anglicised, syntactically correct or not correct, ***padārtha*** please.



And in my not so humble opinion, for which I am entirely not at all responsible for :



 \* ‘exposed’ is not the word, ‘hidden’ (occult, mysterious...) perhaps, is the proper description.



 Vyāsa et al, though great for syntax, are no commentators (explainers), in any sense of the word.

 2,500 years of on-going commentary stand witness to the fact that an explanation is yet to be forthcoming.
