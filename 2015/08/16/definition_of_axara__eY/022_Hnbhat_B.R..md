Still I am confused about what do you want by quoting some common expressions to English and Sanskrit. That doesn't mean every expressions will be equally be translated.

For many words there would be difference of shades in meaning such as given in the dictionaries and you have to chose the proper one to the context by the tools explained in my previous message. If you could not decide by yourself, you can always refer to any commentary or ask some guidance from Scholars than simply asking flatly "how could I find पदार्थ?"
