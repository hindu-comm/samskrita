Oh confused one,

  

Let me answer your objections, thus tobe a light unto your darkness:

  

  

  

　

1\. If dictionaries do give meaning or *artha* of words, why does one say, ".. they aren’t there to find .." ?\`

　

  

To distinguish between '*word*' and a word's 'meaning' or rather '***meanings***'

*****word***: artha**

****

*meanings***:**  
• *as*, *am m. n.*  
• \[in, *ṚV. i-ix* only *n.*  
• in, *ṚV. x* six times *n.* and thrice *m.*  
• in later *Sanskṛt* only *m.* \] aim, purpose (very often *artham*, *arthena*, *arthāya*, and *arthe ifc.* or with *gen.*, for the sake of. on account of. in behalf of. for').  
• cause, motive, reason, *Mn. ii, 213, &c.*  
• advantage, use, utility (generally named with *kāma* and dharma, *see tri-varga*; used in wishing well to another, *dat.* or *gen.*, *Pāṇ. 2-3, 73*).  
• thing, object (said of the membrum virile, *ŚBr. xiv*).  
***• object of the senses, VarBṛS. \<============  
***• (hence) the number, 'five', *Sūryas.*  
• substance, wealth, property, opulence, money. • (hence in astron.) N. of the second mansion, the mansion of wealth (cf, *dhana*), *VarBṛS.*  
• personified as the son of Dharma and Buddhi, *BhP.*  
• affair, concern (Ved. often *acc. artham* with √ *i*, or gam, to go to one's business, take up one's work, *ṚV. &c.* ).  
• (in law) lawsuit, action.  
• having to do with (*instr.*), wanting, needing anything (*instr.*), *ŚBr., &c.*  
• *sense*, meaning, notion (cf. *artha-śabdau* and *arthāt s.v.* below and *vedatattvārtha-vid*).  
• manner, kind, *L.,* prohibition, prevention, *L.*  
• price (for *argha*, q.v.), *L.*  
• (*āt*), *abl. ind.*, *see s.v.* below.  
• *(e)*, *loc. ind.* with √1. *kṛ* (*g. sakṣād-ādi*, q.v.) \[90,2\]

　

2\. To my mind, to understand the *artha,* one needs to see not just the word ***but all its context***. The meaning of पदम् is different in सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् and different in अगच्छन् वैनतेयोऽपि पदमेकं न गच्छति In both instances one sees the word पदम्. Does one not know what the *artha* is in one place and what the *artha* is in the other place ?

　

 Examples please, anyone, of the following well known lakṣaṇa*, in the context of that masterpiece of exposition\* that is the Y*S.

  

  

  

  

Words:

  

 That is not smoke up on that hill,

 thatis mist

 therefor there is no fire.

  

Meaning:

 Please look what is actually standingon the page.
