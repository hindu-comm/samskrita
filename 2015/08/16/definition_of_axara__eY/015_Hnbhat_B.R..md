I don't think there is no splitting of a word by hyphenation in Devanagari writing, and it does not affect the meaning in any way. The splitting is done according to the definition of etymology of the word to facilitate the meaning, according Sanskrit grammar. The splitting with hyphenation in a word according to English readers, convenience for reading, when writtnn using roman script. There is no confusion for between the definitions and both are independent concepts for different purposes. In the above case it does not at all affect the meaning and there is nothing wrong if the writing convension facilitates reading the written form. In writig Devanagari script no such confusion arises as there is no such splitting possible as अर्-जु-न or अ-र्जु-न is not the way it is written as a word without any hyphenation as अर्जुन for an Indian reader it is convenient to pronounce as a single word. Modern readers somehow want to spolit the words in a lenghthy compound, but it is not possible in many cases.

  

Hence this problem is specific to roman writing for English readers.

and the texts prepared by English scholars do not make such splitting in writing roman also between the अक्षर-s or syllables.

The above is a verse from the text of Bhagavadgita.

  

The splitting is done between two words in compounds and this splitting is done every where generally except svarasandhi-s.
