Good Professor,

  

***Words!***

  

I am given to understand that thehuman mind/brain has existed even in itspresent form, for at least 100,000 years, and in earlier incarnations for anothermillion or so.

Thus the mind/brain has been around for much longer than any of its individual owners.

  

The ancients, with this very same brain, realising that what appears to the mind,to be snakes, may actually be just pieces of old rope, hence proceeded to investigated such matters.

with the objective ofgetting at the truth of these things.

  

Such investigation lead to the development of the system of logic that is employed in courts of law even up to this day.

  

Now, whilstminds, ancient or modern, are common to all, as is theworld, our***words***are certainly *not* common to all -they can even differ betweentwoclose friends.

  

*Those* sanskrit *words*,surely refer to our common or garden mental activities or **vṛtti,** but in *todays words* what***are*** those mental activities?

  

The lexicons don't help, grammatical analysis, neither.The definitions etc. are such, that they so overlap one another as to be indistinguishable.

  

Hence thisquestion of mine, good professor, isaddressed to practitioners of Sanskrit saṃyama, and is more than agrammatical query.

  

  

I must thank you for publishing me query.

  

I have provided my email address, for those interested, shouldit beconsidered that subject raised,isoutside the general scope ofdiscussions.

  

Best regards,

  

 Taff Rivers
