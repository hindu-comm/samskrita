OK. Thank you making clear.

So it is not really concerned with words and their meaning or their relationship with the real world we see which is a topic of Words and the world dealt with वाक्यपदीय of Bhartrhari or in short the Philosophy of language emphasis on the Sanskrit Language presented therein.

So I am not interested in your संयम practice and language related to by you.
