Dear Vishvas,  
  

Thanks for sharing this link with me.  
  

Srujan Jha has created this app following the link available at <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/dhaatupaatha>.  

This is a Ph.D. work by my student Dr. Shailaja Nakkanwar. As we know there is no 'THE' dhaatupaa.tha. There arae lot of variations among them. Prof. Palsule and later Bagiratha Prasad Tripathi have prepared concordances. However these concordances have some limitations, discussed in her thesis. So she took up the task of e-concordance and has developed a concordance of the 3 Dhaatuv.rttis.  

This concordance clearly shows the places where the v.rttis differ.  
  

This answers your remark on the defect.  

  

Best,  

Amba Kulkarni
