Namaste Shri Sunil mahodaya,

  

Not sure whom you addressed your last email to, but here goes:

  

If your claim is that the anusvAra is \*closer\* to "m" than to "n", then we are in agreement. My only point was it is not the \*same\* as "m" and cannot be used interchangeably with it. It does not make sense to me that our grammarians will have sutras separately for the anusvAra when they could have just used "m" everywhere instead of it.

  

Regards,

Shyam
