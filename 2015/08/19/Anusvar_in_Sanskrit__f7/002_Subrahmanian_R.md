Respected Scholars,

The first part, the question, (is ं = न् or म् in Sanskrit?) I take it is about the pronunciation of the anusvara. The second part, (*Please post some Sanskrit words showing both conjunct letters.)* request for example, the statement is not clear to me.



I observe two types of anusvaras used in devanagari script, one is a plain dot and the other a dot over a crescent (ardha Chandra). Generally, while listing the devanagari letters only the plain dot is mentioned. The other one, to my mind, is quite rarely used. It is more common in Hindi.



I feel that the *uccaran* of the anusvara is neither न् nor म्. It is also not a shortcut or abbreviated way of representing ङ्, ञ्, ण्. ङ्, ञ्, ण् न् and म् are anunasiks - मुखनासिकवचन: अनुनासिक: - मुखसहितनासिकयोच्चार्यमाणो वर्ण:. नासिकाऽनुस्वारस्य. ङ्, ञ्, ण् न् and म् are स्पर्शा - hence there is a specific position - कण्ठ, तालु, मूर्ध, दन्त, ओष्ठ. Anuswara being a pure nasal without ‘stops in different portions of the mouth’ is not equal to न् or म्.

अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्ण:, तोर्लि (विद्वाल्ँ लिखति), हे मपरे वा (किं ह्लयति), पुम: खय्यम्परे (पुँस्कोकिल:, पुंस्कोकिल:) etc to my mind relate to the resultant *sound* when two phonemes coalesce and not the options of representing them.

The correct uccaran for sounds in any language can be learnt from a native speaker; Sanskrit has no native place; it is everywhere, but has no particular nativity. Due to passage of time and due to influence of regional languages, the pronunciation does show some variations. The anusvara is one such instance. In the absence of recorded sound, the conventions used by different people in transliteration may be used as the nearest guide.

The word संस्कृत is written as samskrita by a South Indian as the name of the group itself says, but as sanskrit in rest of India and rest of world. The न् or म् variation is pronounced when the anusvara is followed by an ऊष्माण or by ह. वंश, हंस, सिंह are transliterated with letter ‘m’ in the south and letter ‘n’ in the rest of the world - compare also Luft*hansa*. But in my observation, people in the North (or at least in UP/ Uttarakhand) pronounce an anusvara as a pure nasal without any trace of ‘n’ or ‘m’. For example, words like हँसना, गाँ, हूँ.

To sum up, I am of the opinion, an anuswara is a pure nasal and not न् or म्. The difference between the two types of anuswara baffles me more.

With reverence to the scholars
