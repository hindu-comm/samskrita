ग्ं appears like a half baked attempt to write something to persons typing in capabilities yet to create gum sound.

I never came across halanta after swara. ग्+ अं= गं what is the need to put another halanta after that.

Panini shiksha clearly states ह्रस्व& दीर्घ

I can not type the symbol here using google IME but I am attaching a page from Panini Shiksha.



I see lot of tamil characters in the text that means someone typed it without the capability to create the actual symbol and instead decided to substitute it with equivalent sound.
