In simple words, ं = म् in संस्कृत् / संस्कृतम् , ALWAYS !!! (ं not equal to न्)

  

Usage ofंasन्is only due to Sanskritscript (devanagari) being mixed up with Hindiscript (again devanagari) by the early translators of Sanskrit works. In Hindi, the अनुस्वार् (ं) is used interchangeable forन् or म् since it is a Prakrit language.

  

The correct name for the language itself is "Samskrit / Samskritam" but the early English translators put across the name of the language as "Sanskrit" due to them not knowing it properly. Hence the incorrect name stuck as Sanskrit, just like "INDIA" stuck to "Bharatvarsha".

  

In Sanskrit, the words such as किञ्चित् would have been simply be written as किंचित्, if they would have been intended to be the same.

  

You don't need to look far for examples, just notice the Sandhi the Devi Mahatmyam:

As the text actually appears = The words that make it up

स्वपुरमायातो = स्वपुरं + आयतो (1.6)  

हयमारुह्य = हयं + आरुह्य (1.8)  

वैश्यमेकं = वैश्यं + एकं (1.17)  

वनमभ्यागतो = वनं + अभ्यागतो (1.21)
