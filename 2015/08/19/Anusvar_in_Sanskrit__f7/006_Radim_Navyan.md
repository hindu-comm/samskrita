Dear Abhyankar ji,  
  
There are some misconceptions in your answer. I'd like to add notes.  
  
According to मः अनुस्वारः anusvara is a phonetic distortion of ॰म् before consonant. It sounds like a nasalisation of preceeding vowel and neither as "न्", nor as "म्"। The term of such distortion is "at the end of a pada". So samples like अंग etc. is just a doubtful simplification of the times, when there were no correct glyphs in Indian typographies. Say, the 1st edition of Apte's dictionary and his Syntax are typed in such a questionable style.  
  
The second sutra, you mentioned, is reffered not to the way of writing, but to the way of sounding.  
We have secondary distortion, which will give us a chain with variations:  
  
1. ॰म् + हल्॰ =‍‍> ॰ं + हल्॰  
2.1. ॰ं + कु॰ => ॰ङ् + कु॰  
2.2. ॰ं + टु => ॰ण् + टु॰  
2.3. ॰ं + तु => ॰न् + तु॰  
2.4. ॰ं + पु => ॰म् + पु॰  
2.5. ॰ं + य्॰ => ॰ँय् + य्॰  
2.6. ॰ं + ल्॰ => ॰ँल् + ल्॰  
2.7. ॰ं + व्॰ => ॰ँव् + व्॰  
  
Now, sutra 8.4:59 वा पद–अन्तस्य tells us that such a secondary distortion is optional at the end of a pada.  
  
So, until it is the simplification of a publiser, anusvara may be read as nasalisation of a preceeding vowel, inherent in it. That's it.  
When you write किञ्च in your blog, you use an option of a rule 8.4:59, whereas a general rule remains किंच। And in such a case we may talk about dialects in standard of pronounciation.  
But in examples like पंच there is no grammatical ground for anusvara at all, so we ought to spell it like पञ्च।  
  
Return to the question:  

*is ं = न् or म् in Sanskrit?  
*

My answer would be: as a general rule, ं is a distortion of a final म् before consonant, which turns preceeding vowel into nasal.  
  
Couple of years ago I had written in Russian a handbook of Sandhi rules. And I'd be glad to hear some corrections to my explanation above from respected scholars.
