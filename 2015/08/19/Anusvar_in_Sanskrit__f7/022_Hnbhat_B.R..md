I know only according to Sandhi principles, that only म् becomesं अनुस्वार, only before consonants. Panini's grammar confirms this:

  

"मोऽनुस्वारः" ८।३।२३"मकारस्य पदान्तस्य अनुस्वारः आदेशो भवति हलि परतः। \[कुण्डम्+हसति =) कुण्डं हसति। वनं हसति। and before vowel it remains as it is without change.  

  

त्वम् अत्र। किम् अत्र। Here the is no अनुस्वार at all, which becomes म् as you have suggested. It is the म् consonant of the suffix अम्। Only before consonant हल् it becomes.अनुस्वार. Only त्वम्+अत्र becomes त्वमत्र, in all the cases you have quoted. and not the reverse.  

  

This is what I meant. Please explain your supposition how अनुस्वार becomes म्. Even if nothing follows, it will be म् only वनम्। only in the nominative. Without a consonant following, pleae explain how म् becomes अनुस्वार.
