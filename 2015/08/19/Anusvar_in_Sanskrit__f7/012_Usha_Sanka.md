Namaste



Can these above Shlokas be written this way in an easy pronunciation scheme?

*(Write as you pronounce)*

Keeping aside the solution offered for Samskrt words, what is done usually by English readers when English or other languages pose same difficulty issue for them?

  Are the words cut in the ends just for easy pronunciation?

  Are the words changed the same way they are in the examples shown by you?

  Are they tampered with just to be made simple?

  Are words meant to be written some non-standard way just for making pronunciation simple?

Once we find a solution found in other languages case, we can think about application of same technique here as well. And if it succeeds, we can think further.
