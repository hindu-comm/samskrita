No. मोऽनुस्वारः says that पदान्त म् is converted to an अनुस्वार. It is incorrect to say the it allows "using अनुस्वार as an option for writing म्". In general, one can't "use" one symbol for writing another. And further, there is no "option" here. The पदान्त म् is compulsorily converted to an अनुस्वार \|

  

It should be noted at anअनुस्वारis a distinct entity, just like aविसर्ग, or an उपध्मानीय \|

No. It specifies that an अनुस्वार is converted to aपरसवर्ण when followed by a यय् वर्ण: \| This has nothing to do with "pronunciation".

No. These are incorrect way of writing these words in Sanskrit, because there is no reason why anअनुस्वार should exist there. It has to get converted to the appropriateपरसवर्ण \|

No. For the same reasons as quoted above. BTW, note that we do have
नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि 8\|3\|24, which says that "अपदान्त न् gets converted toअनुस्वार". Again, observe the word "converted to" and note that there is no "option" here.

No. This is grammatically incorrect. अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः 8\|4\|57 mandates a परसवर्ण. It is not optional, except in cases like संख्या where the word ending in theअनुस्वारis a पद, in which case "वा पदान्तस्य" 8\|4\|58 makes it optional.

It is worthwhile to note that a चन्द्रबिन्दु: (ँ) is not same as an अनुस्वार (ं). A चन्द्रबिन्दु: is merely a symbol used to denote theअनुनासिक-version of a स्वर \| For example:अँ, which is different than अं \| The two should not be confused.

  

BTW, the sandhiतान् + ते goes as follows -  

  

तान् + ते

ता रुँ + ते \[ नश्छव्यप्रशान् 8।3।7 इति पदान्तस्य नकारस्य रुँत्वम्\]

ताँरुँ ते / तांरुँते \[अत्रानुनासिक: पूर्वस्य तु वा 8।3।2 इति विकल्पेन अनुनासिक:, तदभावे अनुनासिकात्परोऽनुस्वार: 8।3।4 इति अनुस्वार:\]

ताँस्ते / तांस्ते \[खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीय: इति विसर्ग:, विसर्जनीयस्य स: इति सत्वम् \]



As an ending remark - I think the biggest source of confusion seen all over this email is the assumption that "X is used to write/pronounce Y". This is not correct. Each वर्ण in Sanskrit has a distinct pronunciation.
