\> The first chapter – saMj\~nA prakaraNam of the laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudI has a section on uccAraNa according to which “\~nama\~NaNanAnAm nAsikA ca”, where the “ca” indicates that these are pronounce using the nAsikA as well as the normal pronunciation “sthAna” of their classes i.e., \~Na has “ka\~NTha+nAsikA”, \~na has “tAlu+nAsikA” etc. For the anusvAra, the sUtra is “nAsikAnusvArasya” i.e., anusvAra is pronounced using only the “nAsika” and not like m(oShThau+nAsikA) or n(dantAH+nAsikA).

OK. I am not arguing with you. I agree with you. However you pronounce the anusvara, he meaning for not change. Hence both are same. Only the correct form of writing differs due to its following letter vowel or consonant. Yu can stay on your assumption that there is no difference in pronunciation.

The other member as made the difference of pronunciation of both clearly. They are not identical and the written form differs only in form due to sandhi rule. And no difference in meaning and hence both are correct for usage anywheres they do not change the meaning.

I am sorry for misunderstanding your explanation.
