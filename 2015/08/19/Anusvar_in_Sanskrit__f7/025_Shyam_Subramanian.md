Namaste,

  

The pronunciation of the anusvAra is not the same as "m" – the details are in the monograph by Shriramana Sharma at <https://sites.google.com/site/jamadagni/files/samskritam>.  

  

The first chapter – saMj\~nA prakaraNam of the laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudI has a section on uccAraNa according to which “\~nama\~NaNanAnAm nAsikA ca”, where the “ca” indicates that these are pronounce using the nAsikA as well as the normal pronunciation “sthAna” of their classes i.e., \~Na has “ka\~NTha+nAsikA”, \~na has “tAlu+nAsikA” etc. For the anusvAra, the sUtra is “nAsikAnusvArasya” i.e., anusvAra is pronounced using only the “nAsika” and not like m(oShThau+nAsikA) or n(dantAH+nAsikA).

  

Regards,

Shyam
