Its neither of the two. The anusvara along with the visarga are two sounds probably native only to Samskrtam. All other indian languages if they use the above two derive it from samskrtam only.

  

The anusvara is neither "na" nor "ma". You will find the word saMskrta itself has an anusvara. It is pronounced as "samskrtam" (with "ma" kara) in south India and "sanskrt" (with "na" kara) in north India

  

However the anusvara has its own completely nasal sound. The anusvara takes the nitya anunaasika of each varga when it is followed by the aksharas of that varga. This only applies to the set of aksharas from "ka" to "ma"

  

If it is followed by "ya", "va", "la", then it becomes the anunaasika of "ya","va","la".

  

If the anusvara if followed by Ushma or repha, then it does not undergo any change and remains as anusvara (kevala anunaasika) (in the vedas there are many variations to this though)
