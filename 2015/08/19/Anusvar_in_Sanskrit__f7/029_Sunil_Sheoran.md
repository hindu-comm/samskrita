You Sir, read again the source you quote (I am sharing screenshot below). In your source, I have also found the BEST ANSWER that OP could have for his post.

  

The author in your quoted source ([**Four-Anusvaras-of-Taittiriya-Shakha.pdf**](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxqYW1hZGFnbml8Z3g6MzFiZGJkNTY4ZDljOGQwOA)) says, as per the ORAL VEDIC SHIKSHA TRADITION, the ***Anuswar sounds like the NASAL SOUND made with the MOUTH CLOSED***. This I guess is the key to proper pronunciation of Anuswar and agrees with my contention as well that anuswar sounds **closer to** म्.

  

**You try to *pronounce Anuswar bymaking a Nasal sound with your mouth closed* and decide for yourself if the Anuwar sounds somewhat like the म् sound or somewhat like the nasalised य् , व् , न् spoken with your mouth open. You can NOT make a purely Nasal sounds that sounds anything even close tonasalised य् , व् , न् .**

**  
**

**So, let's understand that our Rishis couldn't have been stupid to prescribe difference pronunciations for a single vowel.**

**  
**

**Who will call Sanskrit the MOST PERFECT language then?**
