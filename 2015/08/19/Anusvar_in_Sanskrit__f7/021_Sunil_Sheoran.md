What's the strangness about? Why to debate something that doesn't even help answer the original question?

  

Don't you know हयम् = हयं, वनम् = वनं, वैश्यम् = वैश्यं ?? It's only a difference of form, the meaning stays the same.

  

Everyone knows the *words with an Anuswar ending* are only written with (म्) ending when they appear at the end of line.

For example, at end of line, हयं would be written as हयम् always, वनं as वनम्.

  

The sandhi examples I quoted were to **help emphasise the sound of anuswar (**like **म्)**, otherwise these words would have been written as हयम्, वनम् only.

whereas your counter will confuse the OP even more.
