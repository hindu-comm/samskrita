Dear Shri Abhytankar,



Your observations are more misleading than helping.

//1) The सूत्रम् – मोऽनुस्वारः (८/३/२३) specifies use of अनुस्वार as an option primarily for writing म्. //

No. It is not an option and not a rule for writing only. मोऽनुस्वारः means "padAnta ma, if followed by hal will turn to anusvAra. It is not an optional rule. It is mandatory and not only for writing but in every type of usage (speaking, pronouncing).

  
  

//2) अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः (८/४/५८) specifies its pronunciation following the परसवर्ण-concept.// Again, not pronunciation only.

  
  

//The second सूत्रम् suggests that अनुस्वार would be pronounced not only as न् or म् but as other nasals अनुनासिक-s also//

No. It means anusvAra should turn to ङ्, ञ्, ण्, न्, म् यॅ्, लॅ् or वॅ् when followed by यय्. The next sUtra वा पदान्तस्य (८/४/५९) makes it optional when anusvAra is at padAnta. Thus the examples given by you, अंग. अंतःकरणम्, and अंतः are all wrong, because anusvAra here is not in padAnta.

  
  

//Apte’s online dictionary gives “No matching words found” message when searching for अंतः or अंग. So, Apte’s dictionary seems to be strictly going by मोऽनुस्वारः (८/३/२३) i.e. अनुस्वार as an option primarily for writing म्. For the word अङ्ग one needs to input only this way, not as अंग. //  
  

It is clear Apte's dictionary is following grammatical rules as laid down py pANini and not as per your whims and fancies.That is why you do not get the result when you put a wrong input.

  
  

//So अनुस्वार seems to have been used as an option for writing अनुनासिक-s in general, and not just for न्//

The letter न also turns to anusvAra when not at padAnta and when followed by झल् as per the the sUtra नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि (८ / ३ / २४) and then naturally, it follows the rules for anusvAra afterwards. So when followed by तवर्ग, it should turn to न् (optional for padAnta).

  
  

//But this option seems to be more in use in vernacular languages, especially हिन्दी (हिंदी), मराठी which also are written in देवनागरी.//

As those languages do not follow the rules of Sanskrit and they have their on rules, हिंदी, जांच, दांत etc. are correct.



//Having said so, one may also find अनुस्वार written distinctly, in a special style, in words like ताँ्स्ते (ईशावास्योपनिषत्), which is a संधि of तान् + ते or प्रज्ञावादाॅ्श्च (गीता 2-11) which is a संधि of प्रज्ञावादान् + च.//

This "special style" is not anusvAra, but is anunAsika svara, that is, आ in ताॅस्ते is anunAsika AkAra. alternately there can be a non-anunAsika AkAra followed by an anusvAra, i.e., तांस्ते. This is provided by various rules like अत्रानुनासिकः पूर्वस्य तु वा (८ / ३ / २) अनुनासिकात् परोऽनुस्वारः (८ / ३ /४). To understand this, you will have to learn the PaNini's rules for sandhi properly.



// In ताँ्स्ते the अनुस्वार will be pronounced as न्. But in प्रज्ञावादाॅ्श्च it will be pronounced as ञ् because the परवर्ण् is च and the अनुनासिक of च-वर्ग is ञ्.//

No. In both the cases, anusvAra is pronounced like anusvArA only. As it is followed by स् and श् respectively and not by त् or च्, parasavarNa rule does not apply here at all. (स् and श्

are not यय्)

  
  

//Hope, my observations are in order and help.//

No. They are neither in order nor would they help in this case. As for the answer to Ken's query, I have to state that ं (anusvAra) is a special svara and not equal to न् or म्
