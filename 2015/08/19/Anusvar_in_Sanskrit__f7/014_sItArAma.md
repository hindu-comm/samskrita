I can not say you have been taught wrong, but you can verify with data.
  
Here is the Text & video  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/s-sukta-accent.pdf> here is the text

ई॒रꣳ॑   

ꣳ॑ is the sound pronounced with "gum" to put it in English it should not be pronounced as गुं . if you do not see this symbol then it should not be pronounced like that.  

I have seen many pandits pronounce words starting withऋ as अरु, but just because one is doing does not make it correct does not matter person's position or authority.  

In Sanskrit there is no substitution - Wrong is plain wrong.  

ex - many of the telugu speakers pronounce विश्वनाथ as विश्वनाध । प्रथमा as प्रधमा while reading sanskrit text they do the same, but like i said it may be ok in Telugu but it is plain wrong in Sanskrit, just that simple.
