Read the OP's question again:is ं = न् or म् in Sanskrit?  

The OP means to just ask *if the **SOUND of Anuswar** is like**न्** or like* ***म्* !!**  

**  
**

The question is not about the WRITTEN FORM of the VOWEL (ं orम्) but about the SOUND of that vowel.

I replied saying **Anuswar sounds likeम्** and you came out with a counter to my reply taking the discussion on a different track.  

  

**Whatever the form, think about it and let us know:**

  

Is the sound and meaning of हयं different than हयम्?  

Isthe sound and meaning ofवनं different than वनम्?

Isthe sound and meaning ofवैश्यं different than वैश्यम्?

  

If yes, let us know the difference.
