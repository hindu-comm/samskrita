Thanks dr. Bhat, now, is much clearer.  
  
You mentioned the sūtra 12  
"...but are continued for the preservation of शास्त्र."  
शास्त्ररक्षणम्  
  
  
I understood that you had to stand under the protection of the sastra following their orders.  
  
My understanding is wrong, or it can be a different interpretation, but still right?  
I see this meaning better according to what was stated in the next sutra.  
  
  
अन्यथा पातित्याशङ्कया  
  
  

thanks  

valerio
