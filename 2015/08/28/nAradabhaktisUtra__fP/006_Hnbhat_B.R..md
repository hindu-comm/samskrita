For your first question, with regard to आ, it can be optionally compounded as अव्ययीभाव compound as per the rule

आङ् मर्यादाऽभिविध्योः२।१।१३।।

So here it is part of compound

as भोजनादिव्यापास्त्वाशरीरधारणावधि

तु + आशरीरधारणावधि

If not in compound, it would affect the case ending of the word in collocation with it

आ शरीरधारणावधेः

In Sanskrit, the compound word is considered as a single word and you cannot split in between the individual compound member as you like.

For the second question, the the translation would be

Even after the confirmation of realization, let there be the protection of scriptures!

which would be too literal to make any sense clearly without a liberal translation in English.
