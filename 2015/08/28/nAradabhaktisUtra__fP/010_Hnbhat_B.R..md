There nothing incorrect or confusion if correctly taken in the context as a whole.

The context is definitions offered by the different persons and now it is the definition given by Narada.

Though both have common in meanings, a little difference of the structure of the compound:

तदर्पितमखिलमाचारतीति तदर्पिताखिलाचारी, तद्भावः तदर्पिताखिलाचारिता seems to be correct.

So also, in the other,

तदर्पिताः अखिला आचाराः यस्य/येन स तदर्पिताखिलाचारः, तद्भावः तदर्पिताखिलाचारता seems to be correct.

In the first it is the behavior of one who acts everything submitted to him.

In the second it is the behavior of one whose his acts are sacrificed (devoted) all him.

There is nothing significant difference between the two readings.
