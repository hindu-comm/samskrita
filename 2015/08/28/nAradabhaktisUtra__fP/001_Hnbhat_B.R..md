The second is the correct splitting and the meaning you have to clarify from the preceding and following sentences.

The sentence means,

In contrast \[to the Lokabandhana, which is only up to the realization of one's true self\], the (physical) activity activity like eating etc. is (to be continued) till the end of period the body is carried. In other words the physical needs to be attended throughout life. The requirements of other are needed till the self realization, but are continued for the preservation of शास्त्र.
