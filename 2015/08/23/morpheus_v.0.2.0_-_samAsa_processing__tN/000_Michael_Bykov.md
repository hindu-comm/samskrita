Namaste,  
  
Please look Morpheus version 0.2.0 - samAsa processing.  
  
<http://sa.diglossa.org> - (click on "samAsa examples")  
  
Copy and past any Sanskrit text (UTF-8) to editor, fix it a little if needed, or type several words just in Devanagari. To edit copied text text use Ctrl-click.  
  
Transliteration (IAST) with Shift + mouse over the word.  
  
Click on a word gives morph analysis (if stem of a word is in the dicts) or padacCeda (it marks in green).  
  
In v.0.2 modules of suffix and prefix processing are disabled. And of course Morpheus process only simplest cases at all.  
  
Please write me a line about bugs and suggestions.  
  
Site does not work on mobile devices, and I suspect does not work on IE, so please use FF, Chrome or Safari. Sorry for inconvenience.
