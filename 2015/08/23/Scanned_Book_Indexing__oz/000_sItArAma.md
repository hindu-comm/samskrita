I am sorry if this question was asked before, I could not come across any info with my google search.  
  

I have few Sanskrit books scanned PDF like अष्टाध्यायी प्रवचनम् etc. But these are scanned pages to book and can not be searched. I am not looking for a software to convert full book to editable word text as done by <http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php>  
  

I just want to make the pdf searchable for Devanagari text. Are there any tools available to accomplish this.  

Thanks a lot for your help  

Raama
