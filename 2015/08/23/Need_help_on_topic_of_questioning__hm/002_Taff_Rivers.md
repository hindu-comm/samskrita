Girisha,

  

 Presumably, you are referring to the dialectical\* styleof commentary, intended tobring out the meaning of the text?

  

Examples, of course, are everywhere, but as to works that advisea novice commentator, on itsapplication - they are lost in the mists of time.

  

A mere mention is to be found in the Nyāyakośa.

  

However, there is a modern work (2007) by Columbia University Press, entitled *Scholastic Sanskrit , A Manual for Students*.

  

It is in English with Sanskrit in Romanised Transliteration. It reverse engineers that ancient format, thus to enable todaysreaders to understand that style.

It is not cheap, but it has certainly been of help to me to demystify those commentaries -and as a consequence to reveal their shortcomings!

  

Regards,

  

 Eddie
