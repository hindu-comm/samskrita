Sirs,

  

It is true that names of Weekdays are not mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana and Mahabharata, let alone the Vedas. It is apparent that the concept or practice of dividing into units of seven days was not prevalent in India in those days. I am eager to know when was the days of the week first mentioned in Indian Astronomical works or other religious or secular works, say Amarakosa etc. I find that in Ramcharit manas, Sant Tulasidas says Rama was born on an auspicious day of the week. From the words of Sri P K Ramakrishnan, I am not clear if this division of time into unit of seven days and naming the individual days has started as Aryabhatta is quoted for the planets 'under' (nearer to us) the stars. Is the hora is explanation from Aryabhatta.

  

In a world with a diversity in many aspect of the calendar in different parts of the world, perhaps the days of the week is the only common thing. The beginning of the Year may be from Sayana Vernal equinox, Nirayana Vernal Equinox, from Deepavali, or a date unconnected with any astronomical or historical epoch. The year may be equinox to equinox, sidereal or 355 days with or without intercalary months and so on. The lunar month may be from New Moon or Full Moon. The day may begin from dawn as in India, from sunset as for Muslims, from Midnight as in the west now, or from noon as in Julian Calendar. But, as far as I know,
the days of the week are common throughout the world.

As to the Heliocentric and Geocentric concepts, going by the statement of Al Biruni, Aryabhatta categorically stated that the eclipses are due to the shadows of earth on moon or of moon on Sun. But later day astronomer Bhaskara differed, says Al Biruni, as it would contradict the Vedas.

  

Indian astrology is based on geocentric observations and it does not mean that people are not aware that Sun is the centre of the Solar system.

  

As to Christians beginning their week from Sunday, I understand that Saturday is Sabbath - day of rest and prayer for Jews. Jesus changed it to Sunday and he worked on Saturday (christening a child); Mohammed Nabi differed from both and changed the day of rest and prayer to Friday.
