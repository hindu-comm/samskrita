It is a matter of relativity to consider whether earth is the point of reference or sun is the point of reference,

  

This is similar to where you draw the X and Y axes on a plane paper. If you know that in a particular context, you are concerned only with positive values of X and Y, you can take the origin (the main point of reference) at the bottom left hand corner. However if you know that in another context, you are concerned with values of X and Y in all four quadrants, then you would rather place the origin at the centre of the paper.

  

In fact it is good of Aryabhat to declare that for all his astronomical calculations, his point of reference is the earth. That declaration of his need not be construed to say that he did not know that earth revolves around the sun. His calculations are based on earth as the centre of reference, which he declared. That should be all to it.
