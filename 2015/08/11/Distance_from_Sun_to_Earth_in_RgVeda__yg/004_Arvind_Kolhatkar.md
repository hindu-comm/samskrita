Dear Group,

  

Rigveda 1.50.4 has the following

तरणिर्विश्वदर्शतो ज्योतिष्कृदसि सूर्य \| विश्वमा भासि रोचनम् \|

  

Griffith translates this as follows:

''Swift and all beautiful art thou, O Surya, maker of the light, Illuming all the radiant realm.''

  

SayaNacharya's(1315? - 1387) commentary on this says:

तथा च स्मर्यते - योजनानां सहस्त्रं द्वे द्वे शते द्वे च योजने। एकेन निमिषार्धेन क्रममाण नमोऽस्तुते॥

"\[O Sun,\] We salute you, you who traverses 2,202 yojanas in half a nimisha."

  

(SayaNa does not indicate a source for this verse. He merely says 'तथा च स्मर्यते'.)

  

There are several websites in which it is claimed that SayaNa's above statement should be interpreted to mean that the ancient Indians were knowledgeable about the velocity of light and that their measure of the velocity of light was remarkably close to the modern number of approximately 186,000 miles/300,000 km p/s. Indeed, [this website](http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/science-of-spirituality/the-speed-of-light-rigvedic-hymn) goes so far as to calculate it at 284,883.75 km p/s.

  

The same website supplies to following justification thereof. (Minor corrections added by me.)

  

\<\<

In the Vedas, 'Yojana' is a unit of distance and 'Nimisha' is a unit of time. 1 Yojana = 8000 Dhanus = 9 miles roughly. (1 Dhanus = Bow-string length, an average person's height.)



The measures of time are thus defined in the Puranas:

15 nimisa = 1 kashtha

30 kastha = 1 kala

30 kala = 1 muhurta

30 muhurta = 1 day-and-night (24 hours)

1 Diva-ratri (24 hours) = (30 muhurta) x (30 kalas) x (30 kashtha) x (15 nimisha) = 27000 x 15 Nimishas

So, (27000 x 15) Nimishas = (24 x 60 x 60) seconds

Therefore, 1 Nimisha = (24 x 60 x 60) / (27000 x 15) = 16/75 seconds.



Now, 1 Yojana = 8000 human heights (or Dhanu i.e. length of a bow string) as per Vedic arthashastra. Assuming the average human height in ancient India at 5.75 feet, (5 feet, 9 inches) and 1 meter = 3.333 feet,

8000 x 5.75/3.333 = 13,801 meter i.e., 13.8 km (approx.) or 8.625 miles (approx.)



Thus 1 Yojana = 13.8 km



The speed of light is 2202 yojana in ½ nimisha, or 4404 yojana in 1 nimisha.  Converting this to km/second, the speed of light is

4404 x 13.8 x 75/16 km per second = 284.883.75 km/ps.

\>\>

  

Now we have to remember that we started this computation from the verse quoted by Sayanacharya. That verse manifestly speaks of the speed of the sun and not the speed of its light. According to Hindu Jyotisha, all planets - and even the sun is treated as one of them - move in their respective orbits at a common speed of 11,858.75 yojanas per day. (See ’भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास’ by S.B.Dixit p.317). Bhaskaracharya II gives the same number in verse 6 of 'कक्षाग्रहानयन’ of 'गणिताध्याय'.
Now this number, 11,858.75 yojanas per day, is a far cry from the above-computed speed of 4404 yojana in 1 nimisha. 

  

One may get over this difficulty by conceding for the sake of argument that Sayanacharya's verse is actually talking of the speed of light and not the speed of the sun. Even this concession still leaves behind a number of difficulties. 

  

Both the key concepts of 'Yojana' and "Nimisha' have other definitions attached to them by other authorities.

  

I could not locate in any Purana, the source of the earlier-quoted table from Nimisha to 24 hours. Also, what is 'Vedic Arthashastra'? The Arthashastra that we know of, viz., Kautilya's, does not define a 'Nimisha' anywhere.

  

On the other hand, at least two other definitions 'Nimisha' come to mind. Verses 19-21 in 'Kalamana' of 'Ganitadhyaya' of Bhaskaracharya give the following table:

१८ निमेष = १ काष्ठा, ३० काष्ठा = १ कला, ६० कला = १ मुहूर्त आणि ३० मुहूर्त = अहोरात्र. 

  

Therefore 972,000 Nimish = 86,400 seconds or 1 Nimisha = 0.0888...seconds.

  

Kalavarga in Amarakosha gives yet another table:

१८ निमिष = १ काष्ठा, ३० काष्ठा = १ कला, ३० कला = १ क्षण, १२ क्षण = १ मुहूर्त, ३० मुहूर्त = अहोरात्र.

Here 1 Nimisha = 0.0148 seconds.

  

There is a similar lack of clarity in the definition of a Yojana.
Leelavati gives the following:

४ हस्त = १ दण्ड, २००० दण्ड = १ क्रोश आणि ४ क्रोश = १ योजन. or ३२००० हस्त = १ योजन.

We do not know what is हस्त but if it is taken as 18 inches, 1 Yojana = 9.09 miles.

  

We shall have to display enough flexibility of thought to ignore all these uncertainties if we have to put any credence in the proposition that that ancient Indians knew about the velocity of light.

  

I am satisfied by the explanation given by Dr Subhash Kak [in his paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9804020.pdf)

\<\<

"We have provided a context in which Sayana’s speed can be understood. In this understanding, the speed of light was taken to be 2×182 greater than the speed of the Sun in standard yojanas so that light can travel the entire postulated size of the universe in one day. It is a lucky chance that the final number turned out to be exactly equal to the true speed. Sayana’s value as speed of light must be considered the most astonishing “blind hit” in the history of science!"

\>\>

  

(Incidentally, I have checked the book by Dr HC Verma, cited at the beginning. It merely refers to what Sayanacharya says, without drawing any support from it. He later goes on to explain the modern theory of the speed of light.)
