Arvindji has explained the difficulties in the calculation of the units of time and space. Apart from this, he rightly observes that the quoted refers to the Sun obviously traversing the space in the context of a praise the Sun by a Samba and not in any Vedic hymn. Thus it has to be taken to be granted for the sake of argument that the verse refers to the rays of light and it calculated the distance in Vedas as it is claimed. The style of quoting itself makes it clear that he is not quoting any Vedic Verse :

तथा च स्मर्यते but to some Stores in some Purana.

In the cases of retaking Vedic texts, it is common to use तथा च श्रूयते or तथा च श्रुतिः if does not name the context.

The whole acrobatic exercise seems to be to credit all the modern Science to Vedic Literature.
