The Speed of light in the above verse is discussed asking with many other facts of modern science Technology in Veda-s in this thread of this group:

Many including Mr.Abhyankar ji had contributed to the thread.

The difference is in this thread the calculation is related to the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Here the thread starts as the other, the verse is referred to be in Veda, which is not a fact. The distance is not specific as from the Sun and the Earth which is not fact just guessed. As it happens in the verse (not in any Vedic Hymn) simply suggestive of the distance traversed by the Sun in the Sky.
