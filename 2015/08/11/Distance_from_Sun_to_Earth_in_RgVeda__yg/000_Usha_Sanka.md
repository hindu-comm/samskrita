Just wanted to share this interesting piece of information.

**Idea about Distance from Sun to Earth in RgVeda-**  

  
Perhaps, the great Indian talents in the Vedic age  
had the knowledge of the speed of light.  
G.V.Raghavrao in his book quotes a verse from  
Rigveda (I, 50-4) *Yojananam Sahasta Dwe Dwe Shate  
Dwe Cha Yojane Aken Nimishardhena Krammana  
Namostute*. In this verse, the author pays respects to  
the one (the reference is to the sun light) who moves  
2202 yojans in half nimish. Yojan is a quite common  
unit in India, it means 4 kose, each kose measuring  
8000 British yards and each yard measuring 0.9144 m.  
The definition of the time unit nimish can be found in  
Shrimadbhagwat 11-3 to 10) where it is mentioned  
that 15 nimishas make 1 kashta, 15 kashtas make one  
laghu, 30 laghus make 1 muhurta and 30 muhurtas  
make 1 diva-ratri. A diva-ratri is, of course, a  
day-night which is 24 hours in modern language. When  
you convert 2202 yojans per half nimish into SI units,  
it turns out to be 3.0 x 10 8 m/s up to two significant  
digits, a value quite accurate as we know it today.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayana>  

Given that a yojana was equivalent to about 8 km and a nimesha to about 106.7 ms\[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\], Sayana's approximation to the speed of light comes to about 330000 km/s, which is only 10% higher than the actual value of [c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") as determined by modern scientific experiments.

Computer scientist and Indologist historian [Subhash Kak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhash_Kak "Subhash Kak") describes that the [Vayu Purana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vayu_Purana "Vayu Purana") (ch. 50) has a similar passage, where the "speed of the Sun" is exactly 1/18th of Sayana's value. He claims that although a "rationalist" may dismiss the proximity of Sayana's value to the physical constant as simply coincidence, there is evidence of "scientific foreknowledge" in the ancient Indian [vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayana#cite_note-3)
