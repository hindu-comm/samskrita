According to सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार, this verse is from चाणक्यनीति.
सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार also mentions another variant of line 2 as

स क्रम: सर्वविद्यानां धर्मस्य च धनस्य च .

  

The meaning is clear. The pot gradually fills up by drops falling. The same is true of विद्या, धर्म and धन. (These should be acquired bit by bit.)
