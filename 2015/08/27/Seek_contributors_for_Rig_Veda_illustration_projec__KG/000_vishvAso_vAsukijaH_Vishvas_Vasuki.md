We seek contributors (mainly illustrators/ sketchers, but also story-board makers) for a high-impact, super-ambitious project to illustrate the entire Rig veda.Details[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-N7SWcawTuDSpYXIQ56NfVQ0HZbUQc2gQnjtqtRGY0/edit#).

If you are enthusiastic, please let me know. Speed is far more important than finesse, so don’t worry too much about your artistic level.

Rough example (thanks to shrI-shashanka):![](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/iHhz_FJMgXtvtoO9Mjof-8UioW-DnpHXcARVDKNFxIS9fMHzgy-zyFqzOMIj7BooTPEFtlsBcBnl_Q12=s0-d-e1-ft#https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/o7YQQUX.png)
