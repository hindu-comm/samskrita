This is as per my ghanapaathi.

In the entire yajur veda, no whereक्ष comes. Even if it comes, it has to be pronounced asख् + ष only because of the sutra which says, ifक च ट त प is followed byश ष स, then during pronouncing poorvagam dvittam comes andक gets converted toख.

examples,नक्षत्रं, सम्वथ्सरम् etc, (Sorry I am not able to typeख् + ष in the word nakshatram).

Would like to have more explanation on this.

  

In the veda books written in grantha, I have seen onlyख् + ष, nowhereक्ष is seen, hence this doubt.
