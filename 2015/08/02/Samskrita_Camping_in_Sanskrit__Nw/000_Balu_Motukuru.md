Namaskaraha

  

Some of my friends went for camping to a National park here in US for camping. I am interested to know what can be a word suitable for "camping" in such a style in Sanskrit.

For e.g if I have to ask them "How is your camping going on ?" in Sanskrit, how would I say it.

Request the learned members to help.

  

Thanks

Balu
