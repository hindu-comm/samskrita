Hare Krishna!  
  
I'm a foreigner, I came to India to study Sanskrit. Now I live in Puri (Orissa).  
I'm looking for any good Sanskrit campuses (1 month, 2-3 months...).  
I finished Samskrta-bharati 15 days course (twice) and now I want to go further.  
Maybe there is mailing about upcoming Sanskrit Campuses. If You know about this, please let me know.  
  
If someone knows Sanskrit teachers who can teach me (together with three my friends) in Jagannatha Puri, please inform me.
