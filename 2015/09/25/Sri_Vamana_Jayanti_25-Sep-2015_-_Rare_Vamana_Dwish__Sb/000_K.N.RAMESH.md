Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Vamana Jayanti** falls on 25-Sep-2015 (Friday), I am glad to attach **200 names of Lord Vamana** gleaned from Sri Vamana Stuti available in Vamana Purana and Chapter 92. I had shared this Stuti several years ago and I discovered that it could be used for Archana as it contains exactly 200 names. I have prefaced this with a few rare Dhyana Shlokas of Lord Vamana/Trivikrama taken from a manuscript publication from Tanjore Saraswati Mahal.

  

As I mentioned before, the hymns on Lord Vamana/Trivikrama are just handful in Puranas and I have shared all I have in the past few years. Vamana Purana contains only two hymns (one is same as the one attached) towards the end of the Purana. Though there are only a few Vamana/Trivikrama temples in Tamil Nadu, there are many temples in Kerala

[http://www.vaikhari.org/vamana.html.](http://www.vaikhari.org/vamana.html) There are two famous Trivikrama Temples in Tamil Nadu - **Thirukkovilur** and **Kanchipuram**. Thirukkovilur Temple is also associated withthe first theeAzhwars as they methere in this Temple.

**Vamana Purana** is perhaps one of the smallest of Puranas but cover many details in short form - Daksha Yajna, Prahlada Charitra (covered in great detail in different parts of the Purana), Andhakasura Vadha by Shiva, Mahishasura Vadha by Devi Katyayani, Story of King Bali and Vamana Avatar, Story of Saraswati River, Kurukshetra Mahatmya, Marriage of Uma/Shiva, Birth of Lord Kartikeya, etc. Vamana purana also contains many rare hymns on Vishnu and Shiva, three Papa Prashanamana stotras (I shared some before), etc.

  

Though **Vamana Purana** is a **Vaishnavite Purana**, the equality of trinity is explained in no uncertain terms in many places in this purana - this is no surprise as all purans take the same stand regardless of their color:

  

1\. In Chapter 62, it is mentioned that **Lord Shiva is seated in the heart of Lord Vishnu** (the same message comes in Brahma Vaivarta Purana too) - as explained by Lord Vasudeva to Sage Pulastya. (**mad dehe kiM na pashyadhvaM yogashcAyaM pratiShThitaH**). Later he showed Lord Shiva in Linga form in his heart at the insistence of Sage Pulastya.

  

2\. In Chapter 67, **Lord Nandi is castigated by Lord Shiva for seeing Lord Vishnu being different from Lord Shiva** and he declares that Lord Narayana is his own form and he talks about Sadashiva Rupa. He declares that Hari and Hara are one and the same. (**yo.ahaM sa bhagavAn viShNuH viShNur yaH so.ahaM avyayaH \| nAvayor vai visheSho .asti ekA mUrtis tridhA sthitA** - ***I am indeed is Lord Vishnu and Vishnu is indeed me. There is no difference among the three of us***).

  

So, it is as clear as a pikestaff that supposed superiority/inferiority among the Trinity forms is nothing but the projection of superiority/inferiority complex of mortals bandying such nonsense and non-prescribed stances. Egoistic jingoism, Period.

  

May We pray to Lord Vamana that He buries all our ignorances/AGYAna with His Third Lotus Feet!
