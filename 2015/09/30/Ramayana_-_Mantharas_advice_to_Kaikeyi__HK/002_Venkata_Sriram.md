Sir,

  

Read the kAvya carefully before arriving at such conclusions !! bhagavAn rAmachandra was the contemporary of mahAkavi vAlmiki. 

  

"kO nvasmin sAmprataM lOkE guNavAn kashcha vIryavAn" asks vAlmiki. 

  

Maharishi uses the word "sAmprataM" which holds the key.

  

Study the Adi-kAvya carefully under sampradAya AchArya; then one would not arrive at this funny conclusions.

  

iti,

  

srIrAmachandra charaNa rajOabhilAshi...
