Respected Sirs,

As to the mention 'who was Manthara', in the Mahabharata Markandeya is narrating to Yudhishthira 'Ramayana' wherein he says:

पितामहवचो श्रुत्वा गन्धर्वी दुन्दुभी तत:।

मन्थरा मानुषे लोके कुब्जा सम्भवत् तदा ॥ 03.260.10 \|\|

And Dundubhi hearing these words of the Grandsire was born in the world of men as the hunchbacked Manthara.

R Subrahmanian
