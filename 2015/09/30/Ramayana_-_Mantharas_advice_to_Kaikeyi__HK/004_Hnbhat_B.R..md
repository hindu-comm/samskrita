This is correct and Mr. Ramakrishnan was wrong.

But the comment on the word is wrong.

\> We were told thatइतिहास isइति ह आस - it happened thus, theह being a meaningless supplementary word likeच वै तु हि.

It is not meaningless as per Monier Williams:

**1)ha3\[p=[1286](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=1286),1\]\[L=260032\]**  
*nd.*(prob.orig.identical with 2.gha, and used as a particle for emphasizing a preceding word,esp.if it begins a sentence closely connected with another ; very frequent in thebrāhmaṇas andsūtras, and often translatable by) indeed, assuredly, verily, of course, then&c

Exclamation used in proper place giving the required meaning.

; in later language very commonly used as a mere expletive,esp.at the end of a verse)RV.&c&c

The present case is not a verse to be expletive, but it is a derivation for the word already in use.

The proper use for use of filling in thus, being a meaningless supplementary word likeच वै तु हि.

उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ राजेन्द्र*मुखं प्रक्षालयस्व टः*।  
एष आह्वयते कुक्कुः च वै तु हि च वे तु हि॥

The other version of the above verse for the 3rd is different,:

उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ राजेन्द्र*मुखं प्रक्षालयस्व टः*।  
प्रभाते रटते कुक्कु चवैतुहि चवैतुहि॥  
Arvindolhatkar, Toronto, June 22, 2011. in a blogspot.

In these case, it is completed without anything for completing the verse considering - तु हि च स्म ह वै पादपूरणे पूजने स्वति in amara to fill in the whole Pada!

It is not a verse in this case nor a poetry at all to discuss the meaninglessness, but it gives many shades of meaning इतिहास it certainly happened. Indeed it happened thus.
