There is no unreliability of roman script source:

  

Here is one in romn script source the critically edited Text of BORI:

  

03,260.010a *pitāmahavacaḥ śrutvā* gandharvī dundubhī tataḥ  
03,260.010c mantharā mānuṣe loke kubjā *samabhavat* tadā\|  

  

  

Another source:

  
10 pitāmahavacaḥ śrutvā gandharvī dundubhī tataḥ

[TABLE]

Both are online sources.
