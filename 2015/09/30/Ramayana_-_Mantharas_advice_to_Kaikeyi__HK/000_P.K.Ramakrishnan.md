यौ तौ दैवासुरे युद्धे वरौ द्शरथोऽददात् \|  
तौ स्मारय महाभागे सोऽर्थो मात्वामतिक्रमेत् \|\| ९-२-२८

Dasaratha had given two boons to Kaikeyi during the war between devas

and asuras. Kaikeyi had told him that she would specify those boons at a

later date. Manthara advises Kaikeyi to ask Dasaratha now to send Rama

to the forest for 14 years and appoint Bharatha as the king.

  

Objections - When a human being should come into the picture of a war

between **Devas and Asuras**. Why Dasaratha should give **two** boons to

Kaiakeyi. Kaikeyi was given the option to ask them **whenever** she wanted.

  

The poet has brought these points to develop his story. So this is nothing

but fiction.

  

Mahabharata on the other hand is itihaasa meaning iti iha asa. Thus here

happened.
