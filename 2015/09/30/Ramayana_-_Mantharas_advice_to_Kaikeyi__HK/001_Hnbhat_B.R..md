All wanted to say रामायण is महाकाव्य while महाभारत is called इतिहास and not a महाकाव्य!

This commonly known to those who have read both or learnt Sanskrit Literature. A महाकाव्य need not be a historical account and it never called as इतिहास, even though रघुवंश is explicitly narrates the genealogy of Raghu dynasty, it is called महाकाव्य and never considered as इतिहास!
