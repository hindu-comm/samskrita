Sorry sir. There has been a typo in my attempt to type in devanagari from Roaman. It is समभवत् as you have mentioned and not सम्भवत् as wrongly rendered by me. However, as to the other correction, the text says: वचो श्रुत्वा.

  

10 pitāmahavaco śrutvā gandharvī dundubhī tataḥ  
 mantharā mānuṣe loke kubjā samabhavat tadā  

Respectfully
