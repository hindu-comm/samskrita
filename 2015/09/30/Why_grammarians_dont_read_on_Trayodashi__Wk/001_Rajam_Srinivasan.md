Shree Rameshji;

  

Thank you very much for this interesting info. May I please repeat here some questions posed by own students (I don't know the answers:)

  

1\. How old was he when he died?

2\. What are the details about his death? -- by lion? where -- in his travels? or home? in a city? vidya peeTHA? palace grounds? forest? was he alone? no body tried to help? the lion was captured? killed? ran away? who discovered his body? was there a king? any investigation?

  

I am a "story telling" teacher in a temple paatashaala. My stories are usually "indic." Most of the times, there are adults also in my classes and occasionally others also narrate stories and classes become "group" learning-teaching, free-for all affairs:)

  

Thank you again. I always enjoy and benefit enormously from your posts which I share with others in my class and outside class also.

  

Warm Regards,

  

Iyengar
