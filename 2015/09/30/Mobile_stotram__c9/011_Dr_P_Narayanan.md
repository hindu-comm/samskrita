क्रुद्धान्महिषात् पलायन्ते सुधियः ।  
Every learned member here knows that the above "stotra" has too many grammatical mistakes and too many metrical errors. As a lover of Sanskrit, I did protest against posting of such substandard material in this group in name of joke. It is none of my duties to correct the errors and make it a beautiful poem. Asking a critic to rewrite the poetry is as meaningless as a asking a customer in a hotel to cook delicious food.  
I think it is not your own poetry and you may not take a criticism to be an offence against you.  
Anyway, I am really sorry if my statement hurt you and I am not interested to post anything further and drag this debate. This will be the last post from me in this subject unless any specific clarification regarding the mistakes in the above "stotram" is required. I did not list the mistskes as they are too obvious.
