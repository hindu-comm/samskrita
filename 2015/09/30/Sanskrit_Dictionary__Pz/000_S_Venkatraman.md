Dear all,  
  
After my retirement recently, I have started a self-study of Sanskrit with Mr R J Antoine's Sanskrit Manual. My joining this group is also a part of that endeavour. It's really a wonderful group. Though some topics are beyond me, I generally find the posts here extremely helpful to me.  
  
I am looking for a good Sanskrit dictionary. I find that there are two in the market- one by Apte and the other by Monier Williams. Could you please advise me which one I should go for? Also the print quality of both is quite bad. Whichever dictionary is recommended, can you please also advise me on a publication which has a relatively better print quality?  
  
Many thanks for your help. Pranams.  
  
Venkat.
