Or maybe it isअर्थरिशक्तिः न तु शब्दरि सन्धरि वा.

The ungrammaticalness is accepted by Abhyankar to add interesting facet to the meaning in his own interpretation:

This how he makes study of Gita interesting:

By this पदच्छेद the phrase यः सर्वत्रान् अभिस्नेहः may be interpreted as one who has अभिस्नेह i.e. compassion, सर्वत्रान् for all. The compassion unto all means, at the least, “malice unto none”.

"In such interpretation, one would be taking the liberty of treatingसर्वत्र as an adjective. This would be grammatically challengeable. But this presents an interesting facet."
