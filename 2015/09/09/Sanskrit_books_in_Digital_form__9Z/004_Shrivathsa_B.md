hariH OM,  

anunAd mahoday,  
  

 seems like the input is wrong. I didn't try all files, only one, and it was a case of prathamacumbane dantabhagnam :-). I tried converting  
<http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/sanskrit/ayurveda/Jyootsnikaa.txt> into devanAgari, but got bad results.  
  

 will you please confirm? I tried converting using sanscript tool and received similar results.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
