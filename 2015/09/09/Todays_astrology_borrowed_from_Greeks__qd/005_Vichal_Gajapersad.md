Hi Sir,

  

Are you familiar with the yuga's?  
Here is a link:<https://sites.google.com/view/vedictimeperiods>

  

So, Ramayana occured in the 24th Treta Yuga while you try to link it to our current Treta Yuga (which is the 28th).

  

This is information which can be accepted if you are a devotee or want to be one.

If you still want to use intelligence to somehow prove or disprove the Veda, then you will be bewildered as I am, since 2009 (the year I started to seriously investigate religion after failures in my materialistic endeavors).

  

Regards,

  
Vichal
