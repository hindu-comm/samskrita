The topic of Mahabharata's period of writing, astronomical references found in it and their interpretation, whether the Indians borrowed certain concepts of Jyotisha from the Greeks etc are above my pay-grade and I do not wish to comment upon them. I would only draw the attention of those interested in them to Shankar Balkrisha Dixit's masterly exposition 'भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा प्राचीन आणि अर्वाचीन इतिहास', in which he has dealt with these topics from p.107 onwards.

  

The book is in Marathi. For those who cannot read it, an English translation in 2 parts is available at

and

Please refer to p. 107 onwards in Pt 1
