Please Dear P K Ramakrishnan, spare us the trouble. It is very clear from your emails of late that you have been studying astrology. Good luck to you. But don't arrive at conclusions and try them on this list, just with one data point. Proving something as ridiculous as this requires much more than just one seemingly logical proof. Will you ever visit a doctor who will treat his patients for Malaria, just because he has some fever ?  
  

I am not against the idea though. Study Valmiki Ramayana and Maha Bharata from Geographic angle, Linguistic angle, Culture angle, Traditions angle and all other angles and then conclude. It will be a wonderful study and people will definitely appreciate and accept.  
  

It is not as simple as it seems.  

  

Sorry for the rant,  
  

Viswanatham.
