Dear Sri Ramakrishnan,

  

The observations made by you and hence the conclusions are incorrect.

  

Mr. Ganguli's translation of Mahabharata, Book 3, Section CLXLIX mentions the names of some of the Rasi's (in the words put into the mouth of Markandeya) as under:

  

A gift also that is made while the Sun is on the solstitial points, one again that is made on the last day of the Sun's path through Libra, Aries, Gemini, Virgo, and Pisces, a gift again during eclipses of the Moon and the Sun, produce merit that is inexhaustible.

  

Regards

R Subrahmanian
