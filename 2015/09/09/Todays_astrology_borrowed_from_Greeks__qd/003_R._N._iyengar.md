Dear Sri Subrahmanian,

Have you considered the possibility of Ganguli's translation being wrong? He depends for his interpretation on Neelakantha's commentary. But unfortunately Neelakantha interprets every astronomical statement in the MB as if it is astrological. I would appreciate it if you can quote the original Sanskrit Shlokas from MB to justify your position.

kindly,

  

RN Iyengar
