Ken,

  

 Thisexcellent forum has been in existence for good few years, and it is inevitable that the same topics keep getting raised.

  

In this respect, the*Search for topics*, box at the top ofGoogle's forums can prove to begreatresource.

  

For example, try searching for the magic word 'NASA',

\- click the down arrow in the search box to refine the search...

  

Taff,
