Sanskrit Vangmaya Kosh is one of the best efforts of its kind. It is an excellent, painstakingly researched encyclopedia of Sanskrit literature based on a comprehensive study of all the branches of learning which have contributed to Sanskrit literature. Compiled by the renowned Sanskritist Dr Shridhar Varnekar, it is the result of a lifetime of scholarship, research and review.

  

This encyclopedia has referred to all possible texts composed in Sanskrit dealing with a wide variety of subjects. It has been divided into three sections:

  

-   Section 1 ग्रन्थकार खण्ड

Describes all the writers who have written in Sanskrit are mentioned along with their brief biographies and a list of their oeuvre. In addition, a comprehensive introduction to Sanskrit literature has been given here. Special light has been thrown on the eighteen Puranas and the two epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. In fact, the entire narrative of the Mahabharata has been given in simple Hindi, divided into eighteen parvas {chapters}.

  

The major religious and philosophical traditions of India are well represented. Philosophical texts have been categorised on the basis of the school they belong to. In addition, each category is well represented. For instance, the topic Nyaya Granthas covers texts belonging to Gangesha’s school as well as Jain and Buddhist texts on Nyaya, under their own subcategory. Similarly, the rubric Yoga not only covers the Patanjali school but also introduces the reader to Hatha Yoga, Buddhist Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga.
