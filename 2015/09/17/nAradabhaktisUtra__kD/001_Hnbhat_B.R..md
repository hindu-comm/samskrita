लोहितादिडाज्भ्यः क्यष्।, ३।१।१३।

Case-ending words do not take verbal personal suffixes. Hence समुद्राय+अन्ति is not formed adding to dative case of समुद्र, but adding the suffix क्यष् to the word to get the verb समुद्राय meaning the waves not by itself do not become ocean, but combined become become ocean समुद्र. This much is meant by the verb समुद्रायन्ति those were not समुद्र become समुद्र.

The same suffix with अतरङ्गायन् इति तरङ्गिताः। Passt participle from तरङ्गाय, It is Atmanepadi with क्यङ् तरङ्गिताः।

It is little more complicated to get the correct grammatical explanation. The first is possible according to Kashika commentary.

You said you grasped the meaning and I explained the grammatical status.
