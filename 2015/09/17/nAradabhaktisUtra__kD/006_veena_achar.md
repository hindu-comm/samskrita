sir,  

i mean this to the entire family.  

i found this dedication in the book  

THE SACRED SPACE written by Radhika srinivasan. bharatiya vidya bhavan publicaton.  
  
  
IN  

SPACE  

through structure  

in form through structure  

In body through dance  

In word through poetry  

In sound through music  

In thought through yoga  

When man discovers the order and rhythm,  

he touches the divine within himself.  
  

ancient indian saying  
  

can anybody supply me the original . think it is sanskrit only.  

or even in kannada/tamil/telugu/ hindi?  

thanks in advance.  

veena
