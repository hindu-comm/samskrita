Dear members  
  
although I can guess from the context the meaning of समुद्रायन्ति,  
I can not understand the grammatical form.  
  
  

तरङ्गयिता अपीमे सङ्गात् समुद्रायन्ति ।। 45 ।

  
  
समुद्राय+न्ति seems to be a dative with the ending of a verb in the 3rd plural.  
  
Can anyone help me understand?  
  
  
thank you  

valerio
