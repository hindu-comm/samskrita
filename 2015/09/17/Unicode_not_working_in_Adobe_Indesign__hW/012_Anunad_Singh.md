I doubt the truth of your statement that a pdf reader software needs  
to find the legacy font used in the pdf file to display it properly.  
In fact, they argue that the main beauty of pdf is that you do not  
need to install the fonts used in it. Practically, I read many  
Devanagari files daily without having the fonts used in them (eg  
Krutidev10) on my computer.  
  
I am aware of the fact that one can see the information about the  
fonts used in the pdf file. I do not know the exact purpose of  
providing this information, but I use it for converting the pdf file  
to a text (Unicode Devanagari) file whenever needed.
