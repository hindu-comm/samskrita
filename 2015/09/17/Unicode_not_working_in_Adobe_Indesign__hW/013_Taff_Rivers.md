Anunad,  
  
 ==> I doubt the truth of your statement that a pdf reader software needs  
 ==> to find the legacy font used in the pdf file to display it properly.  
  
  
 It is not clear as to whose statement you are referring to, I assume it is mine.  
  
 What it is clear though, is that you misread and misquote these postings.  
  
 The issue is the ability, or otherwise, to view ***extracted text*** in the desired font.  
  
 A pdf will indeed embed all but the most universal of standard Latin fonts, thus to be trully a formatted *portable* document***.  
  
***  
 However, obtaining readable text ***from a pfd*** is another matter.  
  
 As these postings tell you, readability requires not only the presence of the original font on the users machine,  
 but also the presence of the target font.  
 Not to mention access to a utility to convert the one to the other.***  
  
*** But first, it will be necessary to know what that original font embedded or not, actually is, which the pdf itself can tell you.***  
  
*** Although pdf password protection\* and its usage of commercial fonts, may further complicate the issue...

 I love the smell of bytes in the morning.
