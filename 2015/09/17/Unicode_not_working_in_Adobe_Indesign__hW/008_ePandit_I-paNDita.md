Adobe InDesign fully supports Unicode Devanagari now since CS6.  
  
Prior to CS6.

-   CS2, CS3 etc needed seperate commercial
    plugin[IndicPlus](http://metadesignsolutions.com/products/indicplus/)etc. -   CS4 introduced Indic scripts supporting 'World Ready Composer' but
    was not enabled by default (same case with CS5). There was no
    options in user interface to enable this. Some scripts etc are
    available on internet to do this.  
    Some commerical products like [Word
    Tools](http://in-tools.com/products/plugins/world-tools/) (CS4
    onwards), [ScribeDOOR](http://www.scribedoor.com/) (CS5 onwards)
    enable this World Ready Composer via their plugins. -   Middle Eastern (ME) versions have Indic scripts support. No need to
    do any additional settings, just change text direction settings to
    'left to right'.

Version CS6 provided user interface settings to enable World Ready Composer. The settings are described in this adobe blog post.

Version CC (Creative Cloud) also has CS6 like settings.

BTW, simple book composing can also be done in CorelDraw X7 which has full Indic Unicode support enabled by default.
