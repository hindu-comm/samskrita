Namaste,

I run Rasala, which publishes bilingual poetry books (Sanskrit - in Devanagari, and English), and we use Latex, or in fact Xetex, which supports Unicode and allows us to handle all of the layout requirements our books have. It also supports diacritics which means we can use diacritics for the Roman script parts.

We use it on Ubuntu though rather than a Windows OS.

Best

Venetia
