Dear all,

  

We are the official publishers of the books of Pujya Swami Dayananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya. We have many publications which necessitate Devanagari fonts, such as Upanishads with bhashyam. The hurdle we are facing in using Unicode Sanskrit fonts is with our publishing software - Adobe Indesign. It does not recognise Unicode. As many of you must be publishers of Sanskrit texts, or may know of others who publish in Unicode Devanagari, would anyone be able to suggest a solution to this issue? Or could someone suggest publishing software which accepts unicode? It is very strange that Adobe doesn't support unicode when the whole world is using it!

  

Thank you - any help is much appreciated.
