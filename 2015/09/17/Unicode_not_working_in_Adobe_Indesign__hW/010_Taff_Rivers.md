Anunad,  
  
 The matter is not quite so simple.  
  
 First, a pdf includes a list of the fonts that it uses - along with their properties.  
 Look at the menu bar of the pdf viewer to obtain the information as appears in the attached .png.  
  
 The pdf creator may have used legacy Encoding (Ansi) fonts, in which case the app used (in this example from the free Foxit Reader)  
to view the extracted text should be configured to use that font, which in turn needs to be present on the viewer's computer.  
 Likewise for Unicode.  
  
There is no need to rely on Adobe when it comes to reading /extracting a pdf.  
As for writing pdf's, rather than reading them, I can't speak, but up to date information advising of the availability of the IndicPlus\* addon has been given already.
