My experience is that Unicode Devanagari should NOT be used for making PDF file as of NOW. There are at least two problems-  
  

1\) Many applications are not able to make correct pdf out of Unicode Devanagari. In fact most of them are able to handle ASCII or extended Roman at the most.  
  

2\) Some programs (eg OpenOffice) make visibly error-free pdf out of Unicode Devanagari but if somebody tries to extract the Devanagari text from those pdf files afterwards, he gets a mix of Devanagari and Roman and garbage. Not only this, some information is displaced or missing which means you are not able to get the original text even by programmed find/replace.  
  

Both the above problems are not there if you use, for example, Krutidev etc for Devanagari.
