Thanks ! I love this group.  
  
I knew my translation was very far from perfect. I understand your translation and I can tell it's tidier, cleaner and better, overall. Unfortunately I'm not able to come up with it on my own.  
I feel it'll take me forever to reach that level. Oh well, must practice everyday, then.  
  
Thanks again, Sivakumari.  
  
Saludos.
