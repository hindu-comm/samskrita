Hello everyone !  
  
I tried to translate this quote:  
"Train like an athlete, Eat like a nutritionist, Sleep like a baby, Win like a champion"  
  
क्रीडापटु इव दधातु  
भोजनविद्याकारक इव खादतु  
शिशु इव निद्रां करोतु  
अग्रयोधिन् इव जयतु  
  
Can anyone tell me if it's right ? I tried to select appropriate words, but I'm still a novice.  
  
I improvised the word भोजनविद्याकारक for nutritionist (someone who practices or does the science of food?).  
I read somewhere that कारक (doer) is a widespread ending (not an official suffix) in professions... although there must be a shorter way to express the term nutritionist.  
If I used भोजनकारक that would mean a cook, right ? someone who makes food ?  
  
Thanks in advance,  
  
Saludos desde México.
