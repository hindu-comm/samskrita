Dedicated to my parents, preceptors and friends

  

यही अन्दाज़ है मेरा समन्दर फ़तह करने का

मेरी काग़ज़ की कश्ती में कई जुगनू भी होते हैं

\~ बशीर

बद्र

  

یہی انداز ہے میرا سمندر فتح کرنے کا

میری کاغذ کی کشتی میں کئی جگنو بھی ہوتے ہیں

\~ بشیر بدر

  

y

ahii andaaz hai meraa samandar fat

e

h karne kaa

merii kaaghaz kii kashtii mein kaii jugnuu bhii hote hain

\~ Bashir Badr

This is

exactly 

my style of crossing the ocean

,

My paper boat has several fireflies in it

.

  

NB Life is as fragile as a water bubble.Hence, the poet compares it to a paperboat sailing on water. While one cannot change the circumstances that one is confronted with, it is within the realms of possibility to determine how one reacts to them. Some special people, despite having to complete their journey across the ocean of life in a vessel as flimsy as a paperboat, make it a point to illumine their journey. They illuminate it with the lamp of awareness. This awareness of self, or consciousness is known to spiritual seekers as स्वसंवेदन (sva-samvedana). It is this स्वसंवेदन that helps the seeker cross the ocean of birth and rebirth and attain liberation.

  

My own journey is beholden to my parents, teachers and friends. They are the wind beneath my wings.

  

On this solemn day of Ananta Caturdashi, (the last day of the Paryushana Parva) I wish to acknowledge the illumination, enlightenment and succour that they have provided me with. I seek forgiveness from all, grant forgiveness to all and pledge to strengthen my quest for becoming a less imperfect human being.
