Dear Friends,



**Subject: Thoughts On Sanskrit**



Those of you are with us would recall we have had occasions to discuss on the mail a lot of issues on Sanskrit. One such issue was that learned scholarly friends in India often bemoan that it was useless to spend time on this "dead" language.

As against that, German scholars some months back prided on the fact that Sanskrit is indeed a “***live***” language. We had, therefore, held that Sanskrit, a language of India's muni-rishis and of the Vedas and Upanishads, has now found its home in Germany.

Friends, let us read through, in this context, the following account on **"*Mind Blowing Facts About Sanskrit*"**:



Quote (.)



• Sanskrit has the highest number of vocabularies than any other language in the world.

• 102 arab 78 crore 50 lakh words have been used till now in Sanskrit. If it will be used in computers & technology, then more these number of words will be used in next 100 years.

• Sanskrit has the power to say a sentence in a minimum number of words than any other language.

• America has a University dedicated to Sanskrit and the NASA too has a department in it to research on Sanskrit manuscripts.

• Sanskrit is the best computer friendly language.(Ref: Forbes Magazine July 1987).

• Sanskrit is a highly regularized language. In fact, NASA declared it to be the “only unambiguous spoken language on the planet” – and very suitable for computer comprehension.

• Sanskrit is an official language of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

• There is a report by a NASA scientist that America is creating 6th and 7th generation super computers based on Sanskrit language. Project deadline is 2025 for 6th generation and 2034 for 7th generation computer. After this there will be a revolution all over the world to learn Sanskrit.

• The language is rich in most advanced science, contained in their books called Vedas, Upanishads, Shruti, Smriti, Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana etc. (Ref: Russian State University, NASA etc. NASA possesses 60,000 palm leaf manuscripts, which they are studying.)

• Learning of Sanskrit improves brain functioning. Students start getting better marks in other subjects like Mathematics, Science etc., which some people find difficult. It enhances the memory power. James Junior School, London, has made Sanskrit compulsory. Students of this school are among the toppers year after year. This has been followed by some schools in Ireland also.

• Research has shown that the phonetics of this language has roots in various energy points of the body and reading, speaking or reciting Sanskrit stimulates these points and raises the energy levels, whereby resistance against illnesses, relaxation to mind and reduction of stress are achieved.

• Sanskrit is the only language, which uses all the nerves of the tongue. By its pronunciation, energy points in the body are activated that causes the blood circulation to improve. This, coupled with the enhanced brain functioning and higher energy levels, ensures better health. Blood Pressure, diabetes, cholesterol etc. are controlled. (Ref: American Hindu University after constant study)

• There are reports that Russians, Germans and Americans are actively doing research on Hindu’s sacred books and are producing them back to the world in their name. Seventeen countries around the world have a University or two to study Sanskrit to gain technological advantages.

• Surprisingly, it is not just a language. Sanskrit is the primordial conduit between Human Thought and the Soul; Physics and Metaphysics; Subtle and Gross; Culture and Art; Nature and its Author; Created and the Creator.

• Sanskrit is the scholarly language of 3 major World religions – Hinduism, Buddhism (along with Pali) and Jainism (second to Prakrit).

• Today, there are a handful of Indian villages (in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) where Sanskrit is still spoken as the main language. For example in the village of Mathur in Karnataka, more than 90% of the population knows Sanskrit. Mathur/Mattur is a village 10 kms from Shimoga speaks Sanskrit on daily basis (day-to-day communication).

• Even a Sanskrit daily newspaper exists! Sudharma, published out of Mysore, has been running since 1970 and is now available online as an e-paper ([sudharma.epapertoday.com](http://sudharma.epapertoday.com/))!

• The best type of calendar being used is hindu calendar(as the new year starts with the geological change of the solar system) Ref:GermanStateUniversity

• The UK is presently researching on a defence system based on Hindu’s Shri chakra.

• Another interesting fact about Sanskrit language was that the process of introducing new words into the language continued for a long period until it was stopped by the great grammarian Panini who wrote an entire grammar for the language laying down rules for the derivation of each and every word in Sanskrit and disallowed the introducing of new words by giving a full list of Roots and Nouns. Even after Panini, some changes occur which were regularised by Vararuchi and finally by Patanjali. Any infringement of the rules as laid down by Patanjali was regarded as a grammatical error and hence the Sanskrit Language has remained in same without any change from the date of Patanjali (about 250 B.C.) up to this day.

• Sanskrit is the only language in the world that exists since millions of years. Millions of languages that emerged from Sanskrit are dead and millions will come but Sanskrit will remain eternal. It is truly language of Bhagwan.



Unquote (.)



Well, Friends, we could have left it at that. But, a few inputs from our earlier circulatory mails:



· that even in the heartland of Mumbai, there exist a group of families, who converse only in Sanskrit within their family circles.

· that we in India do not have any dedicated University for Sanskrit (if we are wrong, will be happy to be pointed out).

· that Sanskrit can be learnt online.

· that there is an Institute offering a six-week residential course in spoken Sanskrit.

· that the University of Rome were doing research on improving the methodology of teaching Sanskrit.

· That at many educational institutions in the US, very often courses begin with the chanting of Sanskrit slokas by Indian scholars.

· that Sanskrit would be a great unifying force in the multilingual and multicultural country of ours.



Friends, this is the language, declared (Will Durant) and accepted universally to be the "Mother of All Languges". But, efforts to revive this language at the place of its birth, namely, India, that is, Bharatvarsh, is greeted as an act of imposing Hindutva on a 'secular' nation!

Friends, will it be a crime to continue to make efforts to bring this "***Mother Of All Languages***" back home from Germany------, a language that is being used in the highly scientific world of space technology even in NASA?

If we fail in doing so, our progenitors will never forgive us for such great but sad act of omission.

We are writing to the HRD Minister to take action on this, as thought appropriate. Will not some one amongst you, from inside the country or from outside, take it up also? That may help the cause we are fighting for. We shall feel grateful to be kept informed.
