Some of the assertions made are highly debatable. I would say, "Amibiguity, thy name is Sanskrit." The vocabulary is woefully inadequate to express modern life and living.What exactly is meant by saying that Sanskrit is suited for computers? could some one explain? Blind adoration of Sanskrit does no good to Sanskrit or lovers of Sanskrit. I would say that I love Sanskrit like I love and respect my mother for all her strengths and weaknesses.
