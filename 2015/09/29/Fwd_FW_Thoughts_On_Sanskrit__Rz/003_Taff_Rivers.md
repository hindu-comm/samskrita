Thoughts!  
  
 Verbalisations such as those do not deserve such an appellation.  
  
* Thoughts* is much too dignifed a word.  
  
* Sentiments* is a more apt description, badly expressed and poorly translated ones at that.  
  
  
Those are but sentimental flag wavings, better suited to the terraces of sports fields or on the strreets at political rallies.  
Elsewhere, they just serve to irritate, and should be summarilly dismissed, LBW for a duck.  
  
Anyway, there are many 'Sanskrits', spread around the various continents and over the various millenia. Your received statistics have all the hallmarks of the self-appointed 'Made in Gurustan' kind.  
  
  
 Taff,  
  
 Play fair old boy, that's not cricket you know.
