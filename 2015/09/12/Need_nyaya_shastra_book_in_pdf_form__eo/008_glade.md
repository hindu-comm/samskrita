Well Bhagvat Gita have word Param-gati which is very difficult topic to understand.

  

In one of Nyaya sastra book have topic explaining about Param-gati .

  

Param-gati means Gati flows to every "Atma" in this universe from Paramatma (Param-Atma means Supreme soul means Supreme God which is only one).
