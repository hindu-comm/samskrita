Namaste!  
  
प्रबुद्ध has the connotation of being awake, as, through wisdom or due to enlightenment. It does not signify lucidity like in a dream.  
However, some of the other words like विशद (clear and conspicuous) and सुव्यक्त (perspicuous) can effectively convey the meaning of lucidity. So you have **विशदस्स्वप्नः** and **सुव्यक्तस्स्वप्नः** to convey the accurate meaning of lucid dream.  
  
In the Vedantic literature (e.g., माण्डूक्योपनिषद्), the three states of wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping are identified with three of the quarters of the all-pervading reality. The dream state is denoted by the word तैजस (the brilliant one). In English, one of the meanings of lucid is brilliant, since the dreamer feels as though he is awake and the dreams shine through his consciousness. Therefore the compound **तेजस्स्वप्नः** might mean lucid dream. However, this is very contextual and one may not be able to decipher the meaning of this compound without an explanation!
