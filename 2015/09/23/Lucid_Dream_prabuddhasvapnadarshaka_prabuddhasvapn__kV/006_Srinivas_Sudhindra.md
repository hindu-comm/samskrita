Sometimes a translation needs to take into account the history, cultural context and other factors instead of just translation by dictionary.

The lucid dream techniques seem to be western offshoots/distortions in both theory and practise of meditation technique/state called Yoga Nidra.

If at all we need to name it, in the interest of attribution to original and more ancient practice, Lucid Dreaming = "Swapna Yoga",an inferior offshoot of Yoga Nidra.
