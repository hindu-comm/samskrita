सम्प्रज्ञात denotes one of the two cognitive states of mind in योगसमाधि, the other being असम्प्रज्ञात. As a result of this usage in the field of योग, we have related words like सम्प्रज्ञातावस्था, सम्प्रज्ञातयोगी which have their definitions limited to the पातञ्जलयोग system. This being the case, could we ever attempt to reuse the term सम्प्रज्ञात and assign it to the lucid dream state without offering a technical redefinition? On the contrary, if the same term is already widely used in a different branch having a separate technical definition and theories around it, then it may not be a cause for confusion. Have any such attempts already been made?
