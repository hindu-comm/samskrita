Usually during a dream the dreamer does not experience that he is dreaming. He or she recalls it in the waking state. As far as I can understand your question, you are referring to very special dreams in which one observes the dream like a witness, fully knowing that he or she is dreaming, some times the Self being outside the locus of the body. If this description is appropriate, I suggest such a dream to be known as: संप्रज्ञातस्वप्नः
