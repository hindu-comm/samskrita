Thanks for the translation suggestions...  
I still have problems deciphering whether the words I come up with are acceptable, good or just wrong. I know I'm not entirely out of the way, but sometimes it's hard for me to discern the semantics and pragmatics of the language. All of this nuances in sanskrit words makes me feel in awe. I love linguistics and I just love the way sanskrit can be arranged to create virtually infinite precise and clear words. Must continue practising, though.  
  
I like your translation, Mr, Inyengar (संप्रज्ञातस्वप्नः)  
  
Yes. Lucid dreaming is an ability we humans can obtain... it means you gain consciousness inside the dream state. While you are dreaming you suddenly discover that you are actually sleeping and that you are in the dream state. Instead of having a different "I", your regular false-self (the one you experience in real life) gets in control. You can then manipulate the contents of your dreams and use it to your advantage. I'm currently training in this ability and I've achieved it a couple of times. It's an indescribable feeling when you discover you are dreaming, you feel like you are hacking your dream and you get scared and wake up. You just need to practice more and more until you can continue the dream on your own. This can really change your life, as you are in a more "free" state without many of the mind's noisy negative thoughts. Besides, you can vividly create experiences for yourself than can help you overcome fears in real life, etc. I highly recommend it. It is really worth it. One can start by having a dream journal in which you describe the dreams you experience immediately after waking... after a while dreams become more vivid but still not lucid, but you remember more and more and you can analyze the psychological implications of them after waking. After a while you then actually cross the line and become a lucid dreamer.  
  
I can suggest some techniques like reality checks to improve the chances of getting a lucid dream.  
  
Namaste.
