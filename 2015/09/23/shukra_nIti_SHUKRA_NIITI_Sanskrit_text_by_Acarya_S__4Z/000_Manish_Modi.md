One of the strengths of Sanskrit literature is that it has given birth to writings that have stood the test of time. Ancient works written centuries ago by learned sages and forest dwelling hermits are as relevant today as they were in times past.

  

Sanskrit has an entire genre of writings, known as Niiti Shastras, which outline normative code of conduct in varied situations. Niiti Shastras are like law books. They indicate appropriate behaviour in keeping with scriptural injunctions on dharma {piety}, artha {profit}, kaama {pleasure} and moksha {liberation}.

  

The Shukra Niiti is believed to have been composed by Acarya Shukra, preceptor of the daanavas. What sets it apart from other Niiti Shastras is its breadth of perspective. No subject is taboo and no solution is offered without a convincing explanation. Each verse of this text displays the wisdom of extraordinary insight into the whirlpools of the human mind.
