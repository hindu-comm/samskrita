नमस्ते

Please use Devanagari font or IAST or Itrans for Samskrt words/ shlokas. 



How will you pronounce this? 



naredramargaatta?



patimvaraa?

There are many transcription facilities these days.

One example- <http://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript>

You can also type Devanagari directly through activating it on your PC.

It will be more intelligible and correct if you express your Samskrt ideas in more appropriate medium.
