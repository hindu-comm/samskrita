Namaste,

  

While searching for words in the shabdakalpadruma and vachaspatyam, more often than not, I have come across this - इत्यमरटीकायां भरतः Is this a commentary just like maheshwara, vakyasudha, rasala, etc?

  

I have searched regarding this on the DLI and some search engines but could not get any information. I request that if someone knows more about this Bharata tiika on amarakosha, please let me know.
