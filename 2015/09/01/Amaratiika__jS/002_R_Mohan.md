Namaste,  
  
Even I have come across references to excerpts from भरत's work in these dictionaries, quoting him verbatim while defining and etymologizing some words.  
  
Citing D.C. Bhattacharyya's research, Claus Vogel, in his Indian Lexicography (Volume 5, fascicule 4 of "A History of Indian Literature"), states that भरतमल्लिक alias भरतसेन (alias भरतमल्ल, according to H.T. Colebrooke), son of गौराङ्गमल्लिक, composed मुग्धबोधिनी. Vogel's statement is reiterated by Mahes Raj Pant, in his introduction to जातरूप's commentary on अमरकोष, that मुग्धबोधिनी is indeed a commentary by भरतमल्लिक on अमरकोष. Hence this might be the work quoted extensively in the above dictionaries. We learn that भरतमल्लिक was a scion of a Bengali family of physicians and could have been a famous critique and lexicographer during his days, having also composed उपसर्गवृत्ति, एकवर्णार्थसङ्ग्रह, कारकोल्लास, किरातार्जुनीयटीका, कुमारसम्भवटीका, घटकर्परटीका, द्रुतबोधव्याकरणम् (along with its commentary द्रुतबोधिनी), द्विरूपध्वनिसङ्ग्रह, नलोदयटीका, नैषधीयचरितटीका, मेघदूतटीका, वैद्यकुलतत्त्व, शिशुपालवधटीका, सुखलेखन (according to Aufrecht, Catalogus Catalogorum, page 396).  
  
Now we see that मुग्धबोधिनी is actually one of the glosses on भट्टिकाव्यम् (q.v. K.P Trivedi's edition of "THE BHAṬṬI-KÂVYA" First edition 1898, Pages 15, 24). In fact, भट्टिकाव्यम् has been published along with जयमङ्गला commentary and मुग्धबोधिनी gloss by the polymath scholar from Bengal, जीबानन्द विद्यासागर. He states that this gloss is by भरतमल्लिक. You may download the three parts of this भट्टिकाव्यम् by visiting the following link: <http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2013/12/complete-works-of-jibananda-vidyasagara/>  
  
When we see भरत's quotations in these Sanskrit lexicons, are we to infer that they are मुग्धबोधिनी's or from any of the other lexicons by the same author? Böhtlingk and Roth's Sanskrit-German dictionary and Monier Williams's Sanskrit-English dictionaries say that it is perhaps the name of a single work by the same author.  
  
In any case, one of the other interesting pieces of information I garnered is that मुग्धबोधिनी conforms to वोपदेव's मुग्धबोध and कविकल्पद्रुम, even while it glosses upon भट्टिकाव्यम्, a Pāṇinian work. We can see that शब्दकल्पद्रुम and वाचस्पत्यम् make copious use of धातुs from कविकल्पद्रुम. We must understand that वोपदेव's is a system of grammar different from पाणिनि's. Knowing this, one must be cautious while referring to these dictionaries for the derivations of those words that rely on the sole authority of भरत and वोपदेव. तारानाथतर्कवाचस्पति, however, says that he has taken those inputs only when they align with what पाणिनि has stated.
