I have studied sanskrit just for two months in childhood. But now I want to learn it. I need some book which I can read on kindle. Whatever book I get on net starts teaching very basics like writing devnagari script or they consists of pic of paper edition of book which cant be converted to kindle edition. Please recommend me some good book for me.
