  sanskrit music album and website of new sanskrit songs with Padmashree Mohanlal"s sanskrit introduction will be launched tomorrow at Delhi Mavalkar Auditorium at 5 pm.  

  

**ABOUT THE PROJECT:**

  

A few determined men, smitten by Saṁskṛtam, have embarked on a brave journey to popularise the language under the banner of SaṁskṛtaBhāratī, a voluntary organisation which is already rendering invaluable contribution in this field (<http://www.samskritabharati.org/>).

  

You would be happy to know that thanks to the effort, there are millions in the world who have actually started conversing in Deva Bhāshāon day-to-day basis! This includes many villages in India, where the entire populace speaks only in Saṁskṛtam, not to mention numerous Indophiles in the Western world and millions of Indians living abroad, who took to the language to come back to the cultural heritage of India!

  

This has been made possible by a simple yet revolutionary method of teaching Saṁskṛtam called the ‘Direct Method’. In this method, right from day one, the trainees are taught in Saṁskṛtam alone and not through any intermediate language.

  

There is a general perception that poetry in Saṁskṛtam is mainly about shlokās/ chants and religious verses. The fact is, there exists a segment of poetry in Saṁskṛtam which is simple in nature and dwells on secular topics like Nature, motherhood, patriotism and the like. The objective of this music-project is to reveal this aspect, this treasure-trove of ideas/ poems to the public and thus popularise the language even further.

  

Penned by distinguished scholars of Saṁskṛtam and set to soulful music that covers folk, Tibetan, traditional Carnātic and Hindustāni styles, the songs are sure to find a resonance with the public!

  

The project-team has specially focused on the quality of production. Distinguished singers like Shankar Mahadevan,Sujatha, Madhu Balakrishnan, Harini, Kalpana Raghavendar, Aruna Sairam, Ramesh Vinayakam, Visalakshi Shankar & Karthikalend their voices to the songs.

  

It is indeed heartening to note that renowned actorPadmas’reeMohanlal has given the introduction to the project and songs in Saṁskṛtam.

  

To summarise, this project is an endeavour by like-minded people who are passionate about giving back to the world the rich cultural heritage of Saṁskṛtam
