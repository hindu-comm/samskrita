The Shabdakalpadruma is an encyclopedic dictionary of Sanskrit words arranged in alphabetical order giving the etymological origin of words according to Paninian grammar. It gives their gender, various meanings and synonyms and illustrates their syntactical usage. It also furnishes the various connotations of each word using citations drawn from various authoritative sources such as the Vedas, the Epics, the Upanishads, the Puranas as well as Sanskrit texts on Tantra, Ayurveda, music, art, astrology, rhetorics and prosody.

  

This renowned Sanskrit lexicon was compiled by a team of Bengali scholars led by Raja Radhakant Deb. Its first volume was published in 1822 while the last one was published in 1856. This is a classic Sanskrit dictionary and would lend authority and gravitas to any Indological library. This brand new edition has just been released. It has been lavishly published and expensively bound. Since only 150 sets have been published, the price is justified to an extent. However, it would have been so much better if the dictionary had been retyped. The old Nagari typeface is elegant but might be slightly challenging for modern readers. One fervently wishes that the publisher had spent less money on the binding and gold embossing and instead spent it on retyping this fabulous work.

  

Be that as it may, we are proud to make this fine dictionary available to all our readers. And as a special incentive, we shall offer 20% discount to all those who purchase this dictionary from us in the months of February and March, 2015.
