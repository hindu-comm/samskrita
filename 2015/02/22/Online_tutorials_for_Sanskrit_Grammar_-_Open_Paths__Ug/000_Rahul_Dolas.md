नमो नमः,

I and a few friends of mine have recently launched a website for learning Sanskrit. It's called[www.OpenPathshala.com.](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.OpenPathshala.com%2F&h=tAQGiB48f&enc=AZMZ_n9bCFAdDiIRocW4tdbyw3E_CCNsfS-SGf3gh_gS8Nl4hxbE81dOq4u4r6yVHq5P8WQExVOnQUW7mn31B4qrGk29jhx6u3-Df0GGxFQKcKezCbPcutrhOW3Ko_w-xIjYpgG0YhnuLGCa2HaE8HnT&s=1)We aim to make it your best source for learning Sanskrit!

The curriculum of courses taught are going to be based on class 8-10 books of Sanskrit, making it excellent entry point to learning Sanskrit from the ground up. Also, very useful for current students.

Check out a demo video explaining a topic in Sanskrit.

Would love to get your feedback to improve this project!

  

  

Thank you!
