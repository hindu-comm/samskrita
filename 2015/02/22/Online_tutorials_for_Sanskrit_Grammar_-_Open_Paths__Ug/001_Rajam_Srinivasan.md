Sir,

  

Thanks a million (and more) for this wonderful and generous gift. My only input is this--> I am rather a slow learner. If possible can teachers talk a little slower and make every word -- deliberately "clear?" Of course, right now I really want to coongratulaate and thank these fabulous teachers! They are great!!
