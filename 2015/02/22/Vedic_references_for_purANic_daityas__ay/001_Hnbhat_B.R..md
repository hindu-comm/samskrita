If you are looking for the references of the names of the names of these Puranic names,you can search in Devanagari, in this page:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_trial/upanishadwords/textfiles/concordancecorrect_sa.html>  

  

which is a comprehensive concordance. I think you cannot find.

  

Here is another source for the Names in Vedic Literature:

  

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VEIScan/2014/web/index.php>  

  

where you can search for the names in the encoding provided there.

  

But try. Instead you can look in the Puranic Encyclopedia or the Purana Index for Puranic Information:

  

1.<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/index.php>

  

2.<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PUIScan/2014/web/index.php>

  

For etymological explanation and other Puranic Informations you can consult these two lexicons in Sanskrit:

  

1\. Vacaspatyam:

  

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VCPScan/2013/web/index.php>  

  

2\. Shabdakalpadruma:

  

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/SKDScan/2013/web/index.php>  

  

But no philosophical explanation could be found in these dictionaries, one can imagine on the literal meaning and allegorical ones one infer from the Purana-s, as usual.

There is no etymology given for the word KaiTabha, as you expect. For others there may be literal meaning, but restricted to the context of the episode and beyond that one has to guess on his own.

  

I have given the sources and try your best.
