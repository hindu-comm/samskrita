Are there any Vedic references to the daityas slayed by Devi? esp. in R^igveda?  

I am looking for their role in aadhyaatmika saadhana.  

What are the literal meanings of the following names?  

madhu, kaiTabha, shumbha, nishumbha, raktabija, chaNDa, muNDa., mahiSha.  

dhUmraakSha.  
  

\- Sai.
