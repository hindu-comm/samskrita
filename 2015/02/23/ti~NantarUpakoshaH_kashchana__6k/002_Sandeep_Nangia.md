Looks like the dictionary updater crashes with Android 4.4.4 on Nexus 4. It would be great if this issue can be fixed. This would be so useful! I downgraded recently from Lollipop version because I had too many issues with Nexus 4.  
  
Any pointers to an alternate way to install this dictionary file would be useful too.
