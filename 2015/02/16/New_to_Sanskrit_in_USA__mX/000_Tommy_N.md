I am learning Sanskrit as it is a beautiful language and very interesting.  
I have a great interest in reading the ancient texts written in Sanskrit.  
  
My interest comes from my interest in Buddhism and some of the connections there exist there. Plus,  
the study of language and etymology interests me as well. All of these roads led me to Sanskrit.  
  
However, in the middle of the USA it is very difficult to find teachers. I only have books and the internet.  
Do you have any advice for learning? I have the basic alphabet down and I can sound out basic words...I am just looking for more materials and teachers.  
  
Thank you.  
Namaste
