Hi,  
  

You don't require any software to type Unicode in Linux. Add a new keyboard layout in "System->Preferences->hardware->keyboard", In the layouts tab, you can add a new keyboard for Devanagari, I have added "Indian Sanskrit (KaGaPa phonetic)". I added a keyboard shortcut to switch keyboards by pressing both shift keys simultaneously. Hope this helps.  
  
Thanks,  

Santosh
