Dear all,

I am looking for a Sanskrit word to denote "small pox". Standard dics do not seem to list it. Ayurvedic texts would have dealt with this subject, I believe. I would be thankful for help. शीतला देवी (Goddess for the disease?) is a word which is sometimes used in Kannada. I am not sure if it is used in Hindi and other languages too.

Regards,

Murthy
