The Ayurvedic term for small pox isमसुरिका/मसूरिका andलघुमसुरिका/मसूरिका is chicken pox.. Monier-Williams has listed this word.

शीतला देवी is the goddess to be prayed to for cure from small pax according to native belief. Probably this belief is found all over India. (the Sitala Devi Temple on Lady Jamshedji Road in Dadar-Mumbai is a well-known landmark). In the traditional belief in the lower strata in Maharashtra,small pox is caused by the wrath of a village goddess calledमरी आई.
