Namaste,

  

The vAhana of sheetala devi is donkey "gardabha". I am told that the tooth of donkey was used in ancient times to cure this disease called "masUri".

  

There is a tAntrika paddhati of worshipping the sheetala dEvi and curd rice is offered as naivedya. There is also a certain sect in coastal andhra where the "tarvANi" & "chaddi-annam" (these are telugu words) are offered. tarvANi is the rice cooked in previous night and soaked in a pot full of water. It is kept overnight till the rice gets fermented. 

  

These naivedyAs like curd rice, tarvANi, chaddi-annam are coolants that cools the body temperature. Hence, these are offered.

  

Apart from the cure of poxes, the sheetala devi was worshipped during hot summers in olden days when people used to live in huts as there was every danger of catching fire due to excess heat in summer. The sheetala devi protects the devotee from such fire accidents.

  

regs,

sriram
