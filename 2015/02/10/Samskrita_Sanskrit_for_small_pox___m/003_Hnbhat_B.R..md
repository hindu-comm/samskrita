In Tanilnadu too the disease is believed to be the wrath of Mari Amman, and its relief by praying special worship to the goddess, and probably in Karnataka region too.

  

It is believed as Amman appearing in t the form of the disease. So the treatment consists of leaves of neem tree. or noimba which is also favorite tree for the deity for worship.
