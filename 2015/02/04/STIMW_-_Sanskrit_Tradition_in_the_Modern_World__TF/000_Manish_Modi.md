Call for Papers

  
32nd Annual STIMW Symposium

  
Fri 29 May, 2015 11 am - 5 pm

  
University of Manchester

  
STIMW offers a forum for the discussion of papers on varied aspects of Indian religions. Proposals are now being invited for this year’s Symposium. STIMW papers are presented by leading scholars in the field as well as by research students. They are sent to participants in advance, so that they can be read and discussed in detail. They are available to those who cannot attend for a small charge.

  
Please ensure that your proposal reaches Jackie Hirst ([jacqueli...@manchester.ac.uk]()) by Fri 27 Feb 2015.
