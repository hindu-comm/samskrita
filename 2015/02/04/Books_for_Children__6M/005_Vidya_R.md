# [Bhekarājaḥ Maṇḍūkaḥ (भेकराजः मण्डूकः)](http://bookstore.samskritabharatiusa.org/books/index.php/products-a-z/for-children/bhekaraja-ma-uka2013-09-23-03-59-241476473985-detail)- link for the book at the Samskrita Bharati USA Bookstore.

Namaste!   

  

The above book is a publication by Samskrita Bharati USA. It is beautifully illustrated. It is large-print (Devanagari), bi-lingual (Sanskrit and English)) and dual-script (Devanagari and Roman), with vocabulary at the back. 

  

I am the author of the book. All the proceeds (gross) go to Samskrita Bharati, and I personally do not profit from its sales.
