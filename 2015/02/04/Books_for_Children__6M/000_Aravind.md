All,  
  

I have been collecting references for pictorial books meant for children in Sanskrit. These books are unique as they are available in multiple languages.  
  
Here are links to two of them for those who are interested.  
  
वार्षिकं केशकर्तनदिनम् (Annual Haircut Day)  
Sanskrit: <http://samskritabharati.in/archives/product/varshikam-keshakartanadinam>  
Other languages: <http://store.prathambooks.org/keywordsearch/?SEARCH_STRING=annual>  
  
Paavana Katha: [](http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pavanakathah/)  
Sanskrit: <http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pavanakathah/>  
English: <http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/inspiring-stories-from-the-holy-trio-pictorial/>  
  

Dhanyavaadah,  

Aravind.
