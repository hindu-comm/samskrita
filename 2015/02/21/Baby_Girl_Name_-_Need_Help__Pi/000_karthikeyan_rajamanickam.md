All,

  

Glad I landed here when I was looking around to find what Kimaya meant (Most of the online resources point to it as Sanskrit meaning Divine), but you guys have debated it a bit and said its not.

  

I'm no expert on this but wanted to have a meaningful name to my daughter so I'm making a sincere attempt to get one.

  

Ki is what we have planned to name her starting with and I prefer 2 or may be 3 syllables, any help will be appreciated...

  

Some of the names that I have looked at so far,

  

Kinjal - RiverBank

Kiruba(lini) - Grace of God

kruti - Creation

kimaya - Divine (Some say its Sanskrit )

Krishi - Agriculture/Farming

kriti - art

killai- (Parrot in tamil)

  

Thanks in advance !!
