Dear friends,

  

I believe that the Kathasaritsagara is a story that must be told. Again. In crisp modern language.  

  

Dear Dhavalbhai,

  

Thank you for your suggestion. The Tawney translation is outdated. I would like to publish a brand new translation.

  

Dear Mr Bhat,

  

Thank for your answer. The translation that you have referred to is the one I used to sell earlier. It is now out of print.
