Good Suggestion. But it is difficult to get by google search, the "respectable" translation, as he Manish Modi himself, is the person who realize whether he can respect the translation or not, on reading the translation and Google could not decide it on search.

  

Anyhow there one translation published in Sanskrit-Hindi in 1998.:

and Praphullacandra Ojha

1998 220 mm x 145 mm 3042 pp

Hardcover Rs. 1000 for the set

  

got the information from Yahoo groups.
