My grandson is learning Sanskrit.

In connection with some article he is writing, he is looking for quotations from Sanskrit literature (Veda, Itihasas, Puranas & kavyas) dealing with “Swaagata verses’.

With my little knowledge, I pointed him to one reference -Valmiki Ramayanam 1-18-50b,51,52a ( Bala Kandam 18^(Th) Sarga Slokas 50,51,52) where King Dasaratha offers ‘swaagatam’ to Sage Viswamitra.

I shall be grateful, if you can point out to such similar verses in Sanskrit works.
