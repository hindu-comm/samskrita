This story is available in song form in Telugu too. In my fieldwork, I recorded the song from anold Brahmin lady. She called itGovyaaghra samvaadamu paaTa.



In my childhood, I had this story included in one of my school books. In that version, the tiger turns into Dharmadevata in the end.



I found this story mentioned in one of the articles of Prof. Mahendra Kumar Misra called "The kind tiger and the truthful cow: Folk discourse in oral and written literature." In that article, he says that his mother called the story as the story of "Baula the cow" His article is here: <http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol14/pdf/tiger.pdf>



One question: If the story is from PadmapuraaNa, the Sanskrit verse from of the story must be there inthe Sanskrit PadmapuraaNa. Was that consulted during the creation of this beautiful Sanskrit lyrical translation ?
