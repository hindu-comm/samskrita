It is already available in viki pages in Kannada:

  

[ಗೋವಿನ ಹಾಡು](http://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B2%97%E0%B3%8B%E0%B2%B5%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%A8_%E0%B2%B9%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%A1%E0%B3%81)

  

as I had known from childhoold from standard 2nd onwards.

  

But didn't know about the author or it was taken from Padmapurana.
Whatever available information, is there in the link.
