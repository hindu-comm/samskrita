Thank you most sincerely:) This is absolutely wonderful. Is it possible to have the Kannada version in Kannada script? I and my students will be most gratified to have that song in Kannada before December 16, 2015 -- that is our school-day (Ganesh PaaTashaala in N.Y); we would like to present it in Kannada version. (we have done so in English with the help of Iskcon and in Bengali with the help of Bangladeshi Hindu Association). I hope to seek help from Sanskrit Bharathi (they conduct Sanskrit classes in the Temple) to do this marvellous Sanskrit version by Shree Shankar Rajaram! But Kannada version will be "a dream come true!" By the way, who is the composer of the original Govina HaaDu in Kannada and when was it composed? Thank you again.

Regards
