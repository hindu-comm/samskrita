There are resources available in the net on Ramayana and you can check them.

1\. ValmikiRamayan.net (<http://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/baala/sarga16/bala_16_frame.htm>) gives:  

भार्याणाम् अनुरूपाणाम् अश्नीत इति प्रयच्छ वै \|  
तासु त्वम् लप्स्यसे पुत्रान् यदर्थम् यजसे नृप \|\| १-१६-२०

*20. nR^ipaH* = oh, king; *ashniita* = consume; *iti* = on saying; *anuruupaanaam bhaaryaaNaam prayacCha vai* = eligible ones, to your wives, give them, indeed; *yat ardham yajase* = for which, purpose, you performed ritual; *putraan taasu tvam lapsyaase* = sons, in them \[in queens,\] you, will get.

"Oh, king, let this be consumed" saying so he further said, "for which purpose you have performed this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give this among your eligible wives." So said the divine being to Dasharatha. \[1-16-20\]

नृप O King, अश्नीत इति "consume it", अनुरूपाणाम् worthy, भार्याणाम् consorts, प्रयच्छ वै give it to them, यदर्थम् for whose sake, यजसे you are performing this sacrifice, पुत्रान् such sons, तासु inthem, त्वम् you, प्राप्स्यसे will obtain.  

  
O King you are performing this sacrifice for the sake of sons. Give this to your worthy consorts to consume it. They will bear you sons".
