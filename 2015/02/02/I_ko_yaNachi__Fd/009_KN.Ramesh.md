Thank you all for all the replies.

Matrix of Sri.SL.Abhyankar mahoday is awesome with examples in his lesson.

  

I am looking for the application of sutra [w.r.to](http://w.r.to) following:

  

In some cases the two joining aksharas get mitratvam, some places virOdhatvam,some places lopam, some places anya akshara comes & displaces the original aksharas.

Though normal examples will do, an example for each case [w.r.to](http://w.r.to) vedic passages with svaras would be highly solicited & appreciated.

Or any pointers to this effect with explanations in Hindi/English will also help.
