Please type any sUtra in Devanagari so that it could be exactly located. Don't write in Sanglish spelling.

Please explain your case in grammatical terms and not with examples from Vedic passages you want to understand.

  

I could not understand your problem. Vedic conjunctions have their own different rules for phonemics called प्रातिशाख्य-s and for pronununciation each have their own शिक्षा texts, for each संहिता and varying from one शाखा to another.

Please explain your problem with examples and sanskrit words in Devanagari letters so that it could be understood well by all.
