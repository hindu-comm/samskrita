It is a complete translation of the लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी and not complete explanation of the सूत्र "इको यणचि" itself. His request is limited to the complete explanation of the सूत्र and the complete example for the सूत्र and its complete explanation of the examples. Hence the request is ambiguous. As the name itself suggests, it is a short abridged version of the सिद्धान्तकौमुदी and hence more complete explanations one has to learn सिद्धान्तकौमुदी itself.

That is veryl good. "My Simple Sanskrit Lesson is quite good," and it does not mean it is complete by itself as the request is placed. There are graded explanations according to the standard of the readers and one should follow what he wants to learn.

  

Further explanations could be obtained from the commentaries and subcommentaries and all the commentaries and sub commentaries are in Sanskrit and not translated into English. May be there was no need felt by the readers who are content with Simple Sanskrit.

  

More explanations in प्रौढमनोरमा, शब्दरत्नम्, शब्देन्दुशेखरः and other
commentaries. and even Mahabhashya is available in English Translation and Notes. Depends on the standard of the reader/learners.
