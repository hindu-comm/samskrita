The other way, you should read the Sutra-s carefully and get the meaning yourself and decide the vibhakti suitable for getting the meaning according to the system laid by Panini, in his Sutra-s. It is not so easy. In this particular case, "angasya" Shashthi is to be related with अतः, and if it is षष्ठी, it won't give the meaning, after अत् which is needed for giving the intended meaning, as षष्ठी स्थानेयोगा gives the meaning, the one in षष्ठी, gives the meaning the अम् is replaces the अत्. and अङ्गस्य स्वमोः नपुंसकात् does not make make any relation. Hence अङ्गस्य, अतः is relalted with the पञ्चमी, and hence अदन्तादङ्गात् स्वमोरम् आदेशः। The स्वमोः could be षष्ठी or सप्तमी, but to get the meaning, सु and अम् are replaced by अम्, you have to take it as षष्ठी, according to the meaning of using षष्ठी. But in the case of सप्तमी, it is gives a different meaning to the सूत्र according toतस्मिन्निति निर्देष्टे पूर्वस्य" १।१।६५ as the prescription would be applicable to the previous letter before सु and अम् which could not be related to अम् as it would be अम् would be placed before सु and अम् coming after नपुंसक. So it would not give the required meaning.

See the use of विभक्ति-s in Panini's Sutra-s in the above link, and also other Sutra-s, which help to understand the style of Panini's Sutra-s. This is how the Vibhakti is decided in a Sutra by the commentators.
