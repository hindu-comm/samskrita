Priyananda,

  

  

An update for that Panini software:

  

It is available from the main window of the web site
<http://www.taralabalu.org>

  

down on the right hand side of the page are two Software for download buttons, one is for Panini.

  

It is free to download,but you are required to Register, as instructed on the screen.

  

The software is veryelaborate and full of options, including French translation of the sutras, but only a few are in English(unfinished busynessand the Author has retired...)
