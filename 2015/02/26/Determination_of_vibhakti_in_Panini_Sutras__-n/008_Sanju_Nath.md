"Autobiography of a Yogi" by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda has been translated in many languages including Sanskrit. Been reading the Sanskrit one while keeping Hindi / English page open to follow as necessary. All other languages are available and the translations are generally word to word or thought to thought. Sanskrit is easy reading and has been translated by Sri W. Y. Ivans-Wentz from Oxford.

  

Here's a photo of the 3 books with me:
