Resolution of aसमास depends upon the context. The sameसमास can be resolved in more than one way. This is well-illustrated by the following well-known verse in which theसमास 'लोकनाथ' is resolved as
बहुव्रीहि and as षष्ठीतत्पुरुष', depending upon the context and using the two meanings of the word'लोक'.

  

अहं च त्वं च राजेन्द्र लोकनाथावुभावपि ।

बहुव्रीहिरहं राजन् षष्ठीतत्पुरुषो भवान् ॥
