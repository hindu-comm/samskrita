लोकोत्तराणां शौचार्थं स्वर्गस्थितं प्रस्थपरिमितं प्रस्थशालि

  

The above sentence does not give any meaning ful idea for explaining.

  

Please give the words in their context, where you find and if you know any category of "samasa" try yourself applying your knowledge considering the context and its meaning. If you cannot do it, at least please provide the meaning you understood from the context. Better you give a complete sentence, where the word occurs.
