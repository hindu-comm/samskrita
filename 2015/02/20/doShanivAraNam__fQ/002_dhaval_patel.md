Dear Vasantha,  
Please learn Sanskrit with help of some teacher.  
It is not a good practice to ask questions on basic things like samAsa or sandhi of anvaya repetitively in group. If you dont grasp some specific issue, please read commentaries and even after that ig remains unresolved, it is advisable to float it in group.

Moderators may be in better position to say further.  
There are many scholars who would be able to help you off list.

Regards.
