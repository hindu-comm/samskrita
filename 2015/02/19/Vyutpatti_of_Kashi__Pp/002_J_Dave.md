Margie,

  

As Bhat Mahoday rightly said, Kashi is derived form Kash as in Prakash. You may also note that commentary on Ashtadhyayi is known as Kashika.

  

Shiva being God of Jnan, other major Teertha Somnath is known as Prabhas, again a word meaning light like Kashi. And Jyotirlinga-
another word related to light. In Hatakeshwar - another name of Shiva, Hatak means Gold. We can easily understand that Shivji did not have much to do with Gold, so here it would be used as Tejas of gold. I am sure others will be able to find many more such words..

  

  

ShabdaKalpadrum and Vachasptyam are fist To-Go places to understand words. Bhat Mahoday has given link to Vachasptyam and here is the link to ShabdKalpadrum..
