Thanks Mr. Abhayankar for reminding me the limits of discussions  
related to Sanskrit only. But this does not limit the poionts on the  
discussions, but in so far as the meaning of a word and grammatical  
aspects, difference of opinion can exist in so far semantic and  
grammatical aspects are concerned to Sanskrit are concerned.
