Why should one take allegory when the words themselves give the exact meaning?

  

शरणं गृहरक्षित्रोः \[श्रीपर्णं कमलेऽपि च\] ( ३. ३. ४३८)

शरणं गृहरक्षित्रोः ' इत्यमरः। 'शरणं रक्षणे गृहे ' इति यादवः ।  

  

It plainly means I take regue in Buddha. The devotee is the refugee and Buddha is the refuge.

  

Why to imagin rain and umbrella in the above sentence which is popular? "बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि? and complicate the meaning?
