Right. You are free to assign any comparison to Buddha, and any meaning to the word शरणं which the text "बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि" which is considered as the holy mantra of the Buddha Bhikshu-s which is in Pali language and not Sanskrit language,

  

बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि : मैं बुद्ध की शरण लेता हूँ।

धम्मं शरणं गच्छामि : मैं धर्म की शरण लेता हूँ।

संघं शरणं गच्छामि : मैं संघ की शरण लेता हूँ।

  

If you want the exact location, you can look for it in numerous Pali Texts and Sanskrit Texts on Pali Literature.

  

Here is the explanation as शरण only in this webpage:

  

बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि  

  

I have no objection to your freedom of speech.

  

Here is another page calling these as Buddha mantra-s:

Thank you for your freedom of thinking and speech.

  

Congratulations.
