With reference to limits of discussion there is some additional questions.  
The golden rule of translation is to use the same word in the same  
meaning. Otherwise it will be senseless voluntarism.  
When you, sir, quote Amarakosha and state रक्षतृ as meaning for शरणम्, the  
problem is raised. The same meaning should be appliable to धर्मं शरणं  
गच्छामि and सङ्घं शरणं गच्छामि। Do you see such an opportunity? Me not.  
Otherwise we may consider even गृहम् as रक्षतृ। But that would mean, Amara  
is wrong and there's no two independent meanings, but just one. The  
semantical volume of word शरणम् in buddhist tradition is far away from  
what any particular lexicographer may think of it. This is an example of  
(don't know how exactly it would be in English) secondary meaning of a  
word.  
  
Let's take a drishtantam again. We got a word "apple". I ask you, what  
does it mean being written on my IPhone. You take 19th century's  
Webster's Dictionary and answer something like  
  
"1) a rosaceous tree, Malus sieversii, native to Central Asia 2) the  
fruit of this tree, having red, yellow, or green skin and crisp whitish  
flesh". Plus reference to volume and page number.  
  
And then you adds: "There is "exact" meaning of a word you asked".  
But what really you say? It's defenitely useless answer for me. There is  
no tree, no fruit in my hands, there's only phone. But if you insist,  
ok, let it be "fruit with display" or whatever you, mr. Webster, or mr.  
Amarasinha like.  
  
Hope it's clear enough that there's no reason for our hysteria. I (or  
anybody else) may know the "exact meaning" of any particular word,  
because I use it in disrespect of whatever mr. Webster think of it.  
  
Definitely, it's wery interesting theme to discuss. But, unfortunately,  
not in a maner you wish. Is there a game of one player in your group? I  
haven't noticed it in disclaimer. But if it's so, I 1) beg your pardon  
and 2) propose to close further discussion.  
  
  
Appreciate your encyclopedic scholarship,  
Radim Navyan.
