बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि।     Sir, want to know that in the word
बुद्धं why accusative case isused? Though I know that in going sense we use accusative case. If the meaning of "बुद्धं शरणं - to the shelter *of Buddha*" then in the wordबुद्धं in place of accusative case it should be genitive case i.e. बुद्धस्य शरणं गच्छामि ।
अथवा बुद्धशरणं गच्छामि। Please explain.
