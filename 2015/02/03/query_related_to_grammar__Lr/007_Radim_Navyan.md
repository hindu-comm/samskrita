Why do we use any drishtantam? In order to clearly express some thought. I bet the questioner awares of literal meaning you quoted.  
Someone dislikes comparision of Buddha with umbrella. Definitely has such right. In this case I dislike any comparision at all. Did Buddha give some personal permission to imagine him as refure, house etc.? The answer is 'no' until you show us his notarially attested signature. Therefore in context of बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि there is no difference between refuge, roof of a house, umbrella, parachute and so on. When you call someone absent रक्षितृ, it's already an allegory, isn't it? How can Buddha protect you? He is in अत्यन्ताभावम्। So, there is no 'exact meaning' at all...  
If you say Buddha is refuge during His teachings, I ask - where is His teachings? In any particular text? Then this text is your refuge. In words of living guru? Then that guru is your refuge. There is no place for Buddha being refuge in 'exact meaning' at all.  
  
Such an opinion behind my 'umbrella'.
