सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्यमामेकं शरणं व्रज। अहं त्वां सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः ॥१८- ६६॥ gItA.

  

Allegory has to be read into in a sentence if the literal meaning does not make any sense. As an example, in the wordकमलनयन, the literal meaning is that the person of whose this is an attribute has an actualकमल in the place of नयन. Since the literal meaning does not make any sense, one has to search for an allegory and say that the नयन is as beautiful asकमल.

  

In'बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि' the literal meaning, viz. 'I approach Buddha as my refuge' makes perfect sense, as it does inमामेकं शरणं व्रज.
Therfore there is no need to invoke any allegory at the primary stage.
An allegory could be useful in a discourse on this sentence in aप्रवचन etc. to further elucidate the point as to how बुद्ध is the शरण.
