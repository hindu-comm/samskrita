About 12 years have passed, since I had heard for the first time a slogan भज गोविन्दम्।  
A woman, quite old gopi, squeezed my neck and repeated रदीम्क, भज गोविन्दम् ! रदीम्क, भज गोविन्दम् !  
I replied hoarsely: what in particular do I have to do?  
"Woah, just भज गोविन्दम्, that's it".  
  
I recollect that accident while reading your answer.  
  
Buddha cannot be literally any refuge. He is the same refuge as नयन is कमल। Its nothing but your personal thought of something imaginary (Buddha) as of something else (refuge). And in this case at your will to make him anyfing else. Noone knows, what really imagine a particular monk, while reciting that mantra. One may think of Buddha as of Gold Ocean, whose rivers fall down to his head and makes him rich. The
other - as of atmosphere-like body, that loves each of us. The other - as of some kind of Highest Jusice above all phenomena of the world. Anyone else - as a Embodied Buddha from thanka.  
But in these and others occasions there is nothing but imagination.  
  
The same way with gita statement, you quoted.  
  
The only conclusion we may do: बुद्धः as शरणम् is an abstraction, and being so - an allegory.  
We may dislike such way of thinking, but we are unable to change it. The things are as they are. Whether we like them or not.
