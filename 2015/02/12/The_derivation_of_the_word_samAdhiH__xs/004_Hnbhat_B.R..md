The derivation and the definitions are given in the contexts are given in शब्दकल्पद्रुम and वाचस्पत्य as I have given in my post.

  

युज समाधौ (युज् = to meditate) । The derivation of the word योग is from the verb युज् which has the same meaning as समाधि, also युजिर् योगे, युज समाधौ and both mean the same thing and could be used as synonyms. The derivation of the word. Yoga means योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः १.१ as per योगसूत्र by Patanjali. and according to Bhagavadgita, it is said:

  

योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनंजय।

सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ॥२- ४७॥  

तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्।।2.50।  

  

etc.

  

If you want the meaning, you please go through the book where you find any word and consider the context than following any other text where you found find any meaning or derivation.

F0r सबीजसमाधि and निर्बीजसमाधि please go through योगसूत्र and its commentaries for getting the meaninig and the derivation of समाधि doesn't change in any case.

  

For meanings of समाधि in Bhagavadgita, please refer to Bhagavadgita itself, where itself it is explained in detail. Generlly it refers to Yoga, as defined by Patanjali.
