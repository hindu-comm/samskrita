Thanks महोदय.

  

I wanted to know the derivation of the wordसमाधि in the following sense..

as inनिर्बीज-समाधि, mentioned in yoga-sutra 1.51

as inसमाधौ न विधीयते in Bhagavad-Gita 2.44  

  

I have read it one place (not a dictionary) that this word can possibly also be derived from the other roots (namelyधि,धी,ध्यै). That's why the question.

  

Thanks
