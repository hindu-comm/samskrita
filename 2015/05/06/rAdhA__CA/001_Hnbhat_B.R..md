\> in which work it is narrated the life of Rādhā and the way she left this world?  

Fra!nkly I do not know in which work the life of राधा and the end of her life is described. There are in numerous literary works of different writers belonging to Radhakrishna cult dwelling on the divine love between Krishna and राधा. Here the aspect of love is the development of the philosophical notion of प्रेमभक्ति rather than the biographical account of her as the first representation of this emotion/devotion. This is the account of Puranic Index:

**राधा**

\[L=11606\]\[p=[3-071](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PUIScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=3-071)\]*Rādhā*(I)--came with Kṛṣṇa to mediate between  
Paraśurāma and Vināyaka; spoke on the non-differentiation  
of Śiva and Viṣṇu; Gaṇeśa was a Vaiṣṇava and Paraśurāma  
Śaiva.  
Br. III. 42. 21, 47-8; 43. 21 and 29; 44. 29; Vā. 104. 52.\[L=11607\]*Rādhā*(II)--the goddess enshrined at Vṛndāvana.  
M. 13. 38.

Puranic Encyclopedia gives different versions of her life from different Purana-s:

\[L=5585\]\[p=[625](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=625),1\]RĀDHĀ I. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's dearest consort. Rādhā is consi-  
dered to be one of the two forms of Lakṣmīdevī. When  
Kṛṣṇa lived in Gokula as a man with two hands  
Rādhā was his dearest consort. But when he lives in  
Vaikuṇṭha as four-handed Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī is his dearest \[Page625-b+ 65\]  
consort. (Devī Bhāgavata 9, 1; Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa,  
2, 49 and 56-57 and Ādi Parva Chapter 11).  
Different versions about the birth of Rādhā are given  
in the Purāṇas, as follows:—  
(i) She was born in Gokula as daughter of Vṛṣabhānu  
and Kalāvatī. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa, 2, 49; 35-42;  
Nārada Purāṇa, 2. 81).  
(ii) She was got as Bhūmi-kanyā (earth-girl) when  
King Vṛṣabhānu was preparing the ground to conduct  
a Yajña. (Padma Purāṇa; Brahma Purāṇa 7).  
(iii) She was born from the left side of Kṛṣṇa. (Brahma-  
vaivarta Purāṇa).  
(iv) At the time of Kṛṣṇa's birth Viṣṇu asked his  
attendants to be born on earth. Accordingly Rādhā,  
dear consort of Kṛṣṇa, took her birth in Gokula  
under the star Jyeṣṭhā in the morning of Śuklāṣṭamī  
day in Bhādrapada month. (Ādi Parva 11),  
(v) Kṛṣṇa once went with Virajā, the Gopī woman, to  
the hall of enjoyment (rāsamaṇḍalam). Knowing about  
it Rādhā followed them to the hall, but both of them  
were not to be seen. On another occasion when Rādhā  
found Virajā in the company of Kṛṣṇa and Sudāmā  
she, in great anger, insulted Kṛṣṇa whereupon Sudāmā  
cursed her to be born in human womb and experience the  
pangs of separation from Kṛṣṇa. (Nārada Purāṇa 2. 8;  
Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa. 2. 49) and Rādhā cursed him  
in turn to be born in the dānava dynasty. It was on  
account of this curse of Rādhā that Sudāmā was born  
as the asura called Śaṅkhacūḍa. (Brahma Vaivarta  
Purāṇa, 2. 4. 9. 34).
