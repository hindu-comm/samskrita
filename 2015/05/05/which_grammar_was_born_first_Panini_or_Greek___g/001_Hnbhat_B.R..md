I leave this question to decide and the anteriority to the historians. The historians decide the date of Panini as belonging to 5th century BC cir. according to western Indolologists and he deals with a Sanskrit यवनानी WORd relating to the script of Yavanas (Greeks) as explained by Katyayana, a later grammarian who added comments on Panini's work on grammar. This has been disputed by Indian Indologists recently.

Within the grammar of Panini, who rises first: the verb or noun? Historians claim that Panini said: “ The noun was born before the verb” That may be true??

I don't remember anything said like tcalled his in the अष्टाध्यायी. But he approves the rules by शाकटायन called उणादिसूत्र-s who maintains all the nouns are derived from the verbs and explains in such a way forming rules to derive them.
