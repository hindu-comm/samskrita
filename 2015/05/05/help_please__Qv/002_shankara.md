Namaste,

  

ॐ *गुर्व्यै* नमः is found in most sahasranamavalis and astottara namavalis of Sri Lalita, Gayatri and other devis. One will have to refer to the commentaries to see how this word is interpreted.



regards  
shankara

The feminine gender fromगुरु is गुर्वी as in आरम्भगुर्वी क्षयिणी क्रमेण लघ्वी पुरा वृद्धिमती च पश्चात् । दिनस्य पूर्वार्धपरार्धभिन्ना छायेव मैत्री खलसज्जनानाम् ॥

  

I do not know whether it would be appropriate to call a lady teacher as
गुर्वी, as one would call a male teacher asगुरु.
