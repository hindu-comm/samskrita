Su+aha --well said, once while a rishi was about to offer ghee -ahuti to agni when his sweat fell on it. When he was doubting whether to  
Offer or not, the akasavani asked him to offer the same to agni. Then he said "su- aha". And offered tge ahuti to agni. From then on this became a custom.  
This is a tale in the vedas.
