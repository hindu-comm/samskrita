According to Srimadbhagwat Puran Swaha is daughter of Daksh Prajapati and was married with Agni. It is said that Agni is the mouth of Devtas, and Agni takes the offering when it is offered through her wife Swaha. In the same way Svadha is another daughter of Daksh and married to Pitrugan. So when we offer to Devtaas we say Swaha and when we offer to Pitrugan we say Swadha.
