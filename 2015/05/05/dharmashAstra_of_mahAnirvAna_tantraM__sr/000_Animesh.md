SrI mAtre namaH

Namaste ,

mahAnirvAna tantraM is somewhat a 'tantric kalpasutra' which describes of samaskAraMs in accordance with sAkteyaM ( so a grihya sutraM ),  
AcharaM in general for all and specifically for sAkta ( so a smArta sutraM / smritI ) , Ishthapurta karama+ vAstU AdI ( hence a parishishTha ) , bramhavidya ( hence a Vedantic treaties ). I personally realized that it is very helpful in determination of AcharaM and AnAcharaM in modern context of kalI. It describes of AcharaM , rAjadharma , strIdharma , putradharma ,nyAya , krayavikrayaM , dandaM etc.  
Following post consits of mUla text ( in devnAgri script ) , sanskrit commentary by ShrImad harIharAnanda bhArtI (separated with lines ) and English translation by Sir John Woodroffe of 8th UllAsa of mahAnirvAna tantraM ( 8th chapter according to translation of Woodroffe ) which describes of AcharaM/ smArata mata  
Although there are some non vedic and pure tantric elements but a smarata should drop that portion i.e. should not except it.
