Dear brother,

Jay Jinendra

  

I couldn't agree more! You have described the scenario exactly as it is.

  

We should make sure all our hand written mss. are properly scanned and preserved both physically and on the internet. On the internet, they should be freely accessible. And put up on more than one website, so that even if one website crashes/is hacked, we have several others.
