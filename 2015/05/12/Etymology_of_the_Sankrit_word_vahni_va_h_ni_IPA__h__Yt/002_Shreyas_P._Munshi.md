Respected Prof Bhat Sir,

Thank you very much for your detailed explanation.

I needed this information because none less than a university professor insists that

/ʊəhni/ IPA /ʊəhni/should be pronounced be pronounced /ʊənhi/.(/n/ before /hi/.

  

I did not, however,understand the words
**[Downloads](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/SKDScan/2013/web/webtc/download.html)**and
**[Corrections](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/php/correction_form.php?dict=SKD)mentioned by you, Sir.**

Regards...Shreyas
