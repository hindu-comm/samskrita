In Devanagari writing phonetic script is not available. Hence the doubt. Thanks for the clarification about the pronunciation of ह्न् sequence. There had been discussions about the pronunciation of brahma, Vanni etc words insisting on the pronunciation like bramha, Vanni and pràhNa instead of ब्रह्म, वह्नि and प्राह्ण. These could be differently presented using phonetic script, but there is no way of presenting in devanagari script differently.
