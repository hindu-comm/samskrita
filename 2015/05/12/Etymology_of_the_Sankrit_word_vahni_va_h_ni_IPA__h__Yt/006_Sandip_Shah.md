Hi Shreyas,

  

If you go here -<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de>- you can get access to a bunch of resources.

  

One of them is "Shabda Kalpa Druma" -<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/SKDScan/2013/web/index.php>

  

When you search for something over here, there is an option to "Download" what you searched for and "Corrections" (to correct if there are any errors).

  

I hope this helps.
