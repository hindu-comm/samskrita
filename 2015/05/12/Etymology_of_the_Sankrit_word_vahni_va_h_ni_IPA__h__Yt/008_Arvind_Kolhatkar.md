Dear Manish,  
  
I agree that the rules made by the Maharashtra Government about how words like कवि and गुरु should be written are wrong from the point of view of the purist and a few people, myself included, are trying to oppose it but we are in the position of ऊर्ध्वबाहुर्विरौम्येष न च कश्चिच्छृणोति माम्.  
  
About the other howlers you write about, they are more indicative about the general lack of learning and familiarity with one's own language. The Government rules have nothing to do with it. These howlers are all too common and I cringe every time I see them on shop signs, in credits at the beginning of movies and TV Programs.  
  
The opposition the Sanskrit traces its roots to the simmering Brahmin-NonBrahmin controversy, which goes back in Maharashtra to the historical days when the Brahmin Peshawas became all-powerful and rendered the Chatrapati to a figure-head. This controversy erupts from time to time, its most recent instance being the attack on BORI.
