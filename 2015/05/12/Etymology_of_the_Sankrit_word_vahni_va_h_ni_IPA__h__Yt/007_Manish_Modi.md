Dear Arvind ji,

Jay Jinendra

  

I am aware of this silly rule followed by the Govt. of Maharashtra. So Marathi speakers today end up spelling all words ending with short 'i' with a long 'i'. This would still be acceptable (although far from preferable) as it is in conformity with Prakrit and more specifically Maharashtri Prakrit. However, what is vexing is that suddenly, all the words with long 'i' are now spelt with the short 'i'. This is quite illogical!

  

For instance, the wordसुनीति which, by the earlier logic should have been spelt as सुनीती, is now spelt as सुनिती. And this is the name of a building which houses the topmost IAS officers of Maharashtra!

  

Similarly, on signboards in Mumbai one sees spellings such asराजु instead of राजू ,नितेश instead of नीतेशandमनिष/मनिश instead of मनीष.

  

This kind of spelling scheme is an abomination in the eyes of people who have read good literature and have a reasonable command of the language.


  

I really do not know if caste enters the picture here. But if it does, it is shameful.

  

Yours,

Manish
