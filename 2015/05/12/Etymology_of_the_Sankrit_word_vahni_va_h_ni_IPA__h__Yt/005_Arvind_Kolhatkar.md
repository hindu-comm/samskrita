The preference forवह्नि - वन्हि - वन्ही has more to it than just the inability of the script to represent the correct sound. I know this to be true in Maharashtra and believe that similar disputes arise in respect of other linguistic groups too.

  

There is quite an old movement in Maharashtra to free Marathi from the (perceived) clutches of Sanskrit and to rid Marathi of unnecessary Sanskrit influence. This school believes in writing Marathi as most Marathi-speaking people speak it and would not agree to anything that is not commonly used just because Sanskrit grammar and etymology require it. Since almost everyone, barring a few Sanskrit purists, pronounce the word asवन्हि - and indeed asवन्ही - this, they say, is how it should be written in Marathi.

  

The Government of Maharashtra supports this stand and have decreed in the official rules ofशुद्धलेखन that original Sanskrit words likeकवि and गुरु should be written as कवी and गुरू because this is how 99% speakers pronounce them in the day-to-day speech. Not everyone agrees with this but those who do not agree are in a small minority.

  

This is another manifestation of the simmering dispute about the domination of the masses by the upper castes.
