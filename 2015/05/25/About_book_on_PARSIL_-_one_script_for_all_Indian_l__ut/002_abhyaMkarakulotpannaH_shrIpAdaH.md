Dear Mr. Eddie Haddley/ Mr. Taff Rivers,  
  

I am amused by your charge of my wanting to promote my site ! Do I have my site ? What I have is a wordpress-blog. I do not get any pecuniary gains by promoting anything. I am not interested either.  
  

I am not interested in any name or fame either. My interest is only in "knowledge" ज्ञानम् If people call me a scholar or so, I ask myself, "Does that make me a scholar ?" I am fully aware that my knowledge is so very limited. But, yes, I have great yearn for it. So I keep reminding myself "Woods are lovely dark and deep, ... miles to go before I sleep"  

  

If I get to know of something interesting happening in the context of Sanskrit and something, which can be of interest to like-minded people, or something, which would provoke a thought-process, I share it. That is why the this particular blog is for संस्कृतचर्चा. My thinking is not just भद्राः क्रतवो आयन्तु but भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः  
  

In fact I did appreciate your suggestion, made by you in another message of yours to me, that ISBN, if available should be given. I got it from Mr. Shreyas Munshi and have added it in my post.  
  

Let us keep Mr. Hadley, a healthy outlook, instead of seeing and suspecting non-existent ulterior motives. If भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतःspread of good thoughts will make the world a happier place. Let us do our bit towards that. I appreciate very much such spirit of the people, who started the googlegroup. If not with such spirit, why would one initiate such a group ?  

  

सस्नेहम्  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः ।  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"
