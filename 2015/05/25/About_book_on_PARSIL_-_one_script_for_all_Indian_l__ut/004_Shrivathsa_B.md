Taff,

 Even if you succeed in proving that SLA is promoting his blog / site here, how would it benefit you / us? He says that he isn't earning anything from his blog, but one may ask whether it is a sin to earn money while being of benefit to others?

 My humble request to you to be circumspect in your criticism.

Shrivathsa. B.
