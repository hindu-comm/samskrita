SL Abhyankar,

  

  

It appears to me that your motive is to promote your own site, rather than having the members in mind.

  

A genuine community spirited posting would surely provide a direct link, or at least an ISBN.

  

  

 I for one, am very interested in such matters, but...

  

Have you Googled for *PARCIL*, yourself?

  

Phonetically, *parcil* reads as *parcel*to Google.

  

Even a specific search of *Cambridge University press, Hyderabad India*, reveals now't.

  

  

 Thanks!

  

    Eddie
