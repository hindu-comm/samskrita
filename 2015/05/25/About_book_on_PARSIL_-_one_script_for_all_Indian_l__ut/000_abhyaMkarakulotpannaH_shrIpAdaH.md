Literacy literally means "being well-versed with letters". Literacy is inherent to almost every other Indian language, as evidenced by the fact that almost every other Indian language has its own script. I am of course omitting dialects, which often do not have a script.  
  

Shri Shreyas Munshi, an accomplished and highly qualified linguist, worked hard to develop PARSIL - one script for all Indian languages.  
  
Since PARSIL is basically phonetic, now, even dialects can also have PARSIL as the script.  
  
His book is now published by Cambridge University press, Hyderabad India.  
  

He shared some extracts and very kindly permitted me to put them on my blog-post at - <https://samskrutacharchaa.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/parsil-script-for-all-indian-languages/>  
  

Readers can interact with him at his email ID -
