Sir Abhyankar Ji;

  

For a long time I wanted to write this, but didn't dare:) Sir, I want to declare myself as the President of your fan club. (I am sure there is one; if not this missive should be considered as the beginning of it!!!)

  

I am rather Knowledge-challenged; but addicted to acquire it. (I am sure at least some in this group are also just like me). Sir, you are the "well" which supply the likes of me. Of course, I don't understand everything that is posted -- I am like a pre-nursery kid trying to understand and enjoy rocket science!! But you and many others in this group provide us the "paamaraas" a taste of the nector. Please accept my deeply felt gratitude for everything you do and have done and PLEASE continue -- and don't stop or even reduce whatever your inclinations impel you to do.

  

What else is there for me to say except ...Namo-Namaha to you.

  

Regards,

  

Iyengar
