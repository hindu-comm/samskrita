The Original Work

  

Acarya Rajendrasuri’s ‘Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha’ deserves mention as the finest encyclopedic work on Jainism. Created as a result of the Herculean efforts of Acarya Rajendrasuri in 1960, it is a magnificent repository of citations sourced from the widest possible selection of Jain texts belonging to both, the Digambara as well as the Shvetambara traditions. It is a gigantic set of 7 volumes, each running into thousands of pages. It covers a substantial selection of Prakrit terms, each explained in Sanskrit using several citations in Prakrit and Sanskrit taken from various Jain texts. It is a phenomenal achievement and deserves great encomia. For generations of scholars, it remains the go-to encyclopedia on Jainism.

  

The Present Work

  

Unfortunately, the ‘Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha’ remains inaccessible to those who do not know Prakrit and Sanskrit. The present work is a faithful Hindi translation of the original work with the citations removed for reasons of brevity. The result is a compact, handy dictionary of 3 volumes, which gives the Sanskrit meaning and Hindi explanation of each Prakrit term.

  

The unique features of this dictionary are:

-   All words are arranged in Prakrit alphabetical order

-   The Prakrit term is followed by the Sanskrit term and Hindi
    explanation

-   Prakrit/Sanskrit synonyms are provided wherever possible

-   The Hindi explanation provides the literal meaning of the Prakrit
    word, a Hindi translation of its Prakrit and Sanskrit definitions,
    the etymological roots of the Prakrit word and an analysis of its
    meaning

-   Linguistic details such as gender, tense, verb/noun/adjective have
    been provided for each Prakrit term

-   In many cases, cross references to the original Abhidhana Rajendra
    Kosha have been provided

-   In some cases, references to citations from other Jain texts are
    provided
