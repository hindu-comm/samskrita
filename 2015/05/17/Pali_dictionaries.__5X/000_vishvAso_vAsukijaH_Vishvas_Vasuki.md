### thera

\[Vedic sthavira. Derivation uncertain. It may come from sthā in sense of standing over, lasting (one year or more), cp. thāvara old age, then "old=venerable"; (in meaning to be compared w. Lat. senior, etc. from num. sem "one"=one year old, i. e. lasting over one and many more years). Cp. also vetus=Gr. ἔτοσ , year, E. wether, one year old ram, as cpd. w. veteran, old man. Or it may come from sthā in der. \*sthe  ā in sthūra (sthūla: see etym. under thūla) thus, "strong= venerable"\] t.t. only used with ref. to the bhikkhus of Gotama Buddha's community. – (a) (adj.) senior, Vin I.47, 290 (th. bhikkhū opp. navā bh.), 159 (th. bhikkhu a senior bh. opp. to navaka bh. a novice), 187; II.16, 212. Therânutherā bhikkhū seniors & those next to them in age dating not from birth, but from admission to the Order). Three grades are distigguished, thera bh., majjhima bh., nava bh., at D I.78. – See also A II.23, 147, 168; V.201, 348; D III.123 sq., 218; Dh 260, 261. In Saṅgha-thera, used of Bhikkhus not senior in the Order, the word thera means distigguished. Vin II.212, 303. In Mahāthera the meaning, as applied to the 80 bhikkhus so called, must also have some similar meaning Dīpv IV.5 Psalms of the Brethren xxxvi.; J V.456. At A II.22 it is said that a bhikkhu, however junior, may be called thera on account of his wisdom. It is added that four characteristics make a man a thera –high character, knowing the essential doctrines by heart, practising the four Jhānas, and being conscious of having attained freedom through the destruction of the mental intoxications. It is already clear that at a very early date, before the Aṅguttara reached its extant shape, a secondary meaning of thera was tending to supplant that of senior-that is, not the senior of the whole Order, but the senior of such a part of the Saṅgha as live in the same locality, or are carrying out the same function. – Note. thera in thero vassiko at S IV.161 is to be read tero-vassiko. –gāthā hymns of senior bhikkhus, N. of a canonical book, incorporated in the Khuddaka-Nikāya. Theratara, very senior, opp (d) to navatara, novice D II.154. –vāda the doctrine of the Theras, the original Buddhist doctrine M I.164; Dpvs IV.6, 13.
