(V). १५\].\</F> Satya- भामा refusing to part with the jewel Syamantaka (s.v.), अक्रूर suggested with कृतवर्मन् to शतधन्वन् Bhoja its seizure from सत्राजित as he had failed to keep his promise to marry his daughter to them. \<F>२०: Ib. X. ५७. 3; वा. ९६. ५७, ९७; Vi. IV. १३. ११५-26.\</F> Asked by शतधन्वन् for help against कृष्ण, अक्रूर refused; Bhoja शतधन्वन् killed सत्राजित, the father of सत्यभामा, and secured the jewel but placed it in अक्रूर's custody. \<F>२१: भा. X. ५७. १४-18.\</F> Became afraid, after शतधन्व's death at the hands of कृष्ण and बलराम, and left द्वारका. Evil portents in the city and cessation of rains. It was said that rain fell where अक्रूर lived. Was sent for by कृष्ण to return to द्वारका; gave his sister in marriage to कृष्ण who after duly honouring him, requested him to show the jewel in public, so that राम might not misunderstand him. He did so in the सभा of the सात्वतस् but कृष्ण placed Syamantaka back in his hand. \<F>२२: Ib. X. ५७. २९-41 \[1-4\]; Br. III. ७१. ५९ and ८३; Vi.
