Subject: CUP have published my book  
  
  
  
Dear all,  

You'll be happy to know that the Cambridge University Press (CUP) have published my book titled 'Introducing PARSIL' (Phonetic Alphabet for Romanization of Spellings in Indian Languages).

It's a paperback edition listed as ISBN 978-93-84463-38-0.

  

Many of my friends and well-wishers have sent congratulations to me on CUP publishing my book'Introducing PARSIL' and many of them have frankly said that they are not at all familiar with the subject but still they will try to have a look at my book. I must match their frankness and I frankly say the following:

\* my book is not a fiction and so some of my friends may not find it easy to read (nor enjoyable!) and so I am attaching extracts from the book's Preface, the Foreword, a write up from Vienna, the acknowledgements, and the first chapter of the book for you scholars to get an overview of the book. For people like me, I am also attaching the book's Appendix A for explanation of the various terms used in the book.

\*(*ha ha ha*: the book might be good to read if you can't get sleep or are really fed up with life. When you read it you might suddenly realize that you were much better off a few minutes before you started reading the book!!!).

\* atbest,the book may be kept in the house like you keep a dictionary (this one for referring to it when you wish to Romanize an Indian Language word, the pronunciation of which you wish does not get distorted when the Romanized version is read out aloud. In the book one will find, in a tabulated form, the symbols of various other writing systems available today and one may choose any one from among them for the Romanization of their chosen Indian Language word).

  

\*The base of the book is linguistics and phonetics (of course the elementary level, which is mine!)

  

...Regards...Shreyas
