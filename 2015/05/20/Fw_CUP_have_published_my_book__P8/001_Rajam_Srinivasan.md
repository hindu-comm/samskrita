Respected Sir;

  

Thank you for this generous gift. When I tried to open the downloaded files, I got a message saying that since the files were sent in an e-mail, they were not properly "coded". I don't exactly know what it means. I wonder if any one had similar problem. Can any one help me with this? I will greatly appreciate such assistance. 

  

I have formulated a script-system -- very simple and may be even simplistic -- using geometrical shapes of -- (.) , (\_), (,), -- that is, a "bindu", a "rekha" a straight line, and a "vakra rekha" a curved line' (supposed to be the basic/foundational units of pre- Devanagari or Brahmi script known as "Shaarada" script; in my system these three foundational units have become circles, triangles and squares (parts of them and various combinations). I am a volunteer teacher in a few of Hindu Temples in the U.S. Children and others also, seem to be delighted with this system of geometrical shapes for alphabets-- they seem to be able to learn the whole Indian "VarNamaala" with in a day or so:))). Since the "VarNa maala" of almost all Indian languages resembles that of Samskrutam and this "lipi" system is basically Samskrutam, many parents have found it fun and easy to follow it up at home and get the kids to practice their own language alphabet-system. Parents speaking Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Gujatathi and Hindi appear to find it useful!

  

Unfortunately, not being very computer-savy, I am still trying to discover/learn to upload the whole thing to some where!! (Of course, there is no copyright and is not going to be any on this system).

  

Hence, my abiding curiosity about your book.

  

Regards,

  

Iyengar
