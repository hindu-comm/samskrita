Respected Rajam Srinivasan Sir,

**You say: When I tried to open the downloaded files, I got a message saying that since the files were sent in an e-mail, they were not properly "coded". I don't exactly know what it means. I wonder if any one had similar problem. Can any one help me with this? I will greatly appreciate such assistance.**



**1. Yes Sir. Many have reported similar problems.** Some Friends have reported that they were unable to open by clicking on the individual attachments but were able to do so when they clicked 'download all'.

I am also not expert on computers. So try the above method. If you still don't succeed, let me know. I'll re-send the mail.(One more person has suggested another method. I'll forward his mail to you separately. OK Sir?)

  

2\. You are doing a wonderful service with the a script-system formulated by you. Congratulations and hats-off to you, Sir.

Regards...Shreyas (Learner for Life).

Respected Sir;

  

Thank you for this generous gift. When I tried to open the downloaded files, I got a message saying that since the files were sent in an e-mail, they were not properly "coded". I don't exactly know what it means. I wonder if any one had similar problem. Can any one help me with this? I will greatly appreciate such assistance. 

  

I have formulated a script-system -- very simple and may be even simplistic -- using geometrical shapes of -- (.) , (\_), (,), -- that is, a "bindu", a "rekha" a straight line, and a "vakra rekha" a curved line' (supposed to be the basic/foundational units of pre- Devanagari or Brahmi script known as "Shaarada" script; in my system these three foundational units have become circles, triangles and squares (parts of them and various combinations). I am a volunteer teacher in a few of Hindu Temples in the U.S. Children and others also, seem to be delighted with this system of geometrical shapes for alphabets-- they seem to be able to learn the whole Indian "VarNamaala" with in a day or so:))). Since the "VarNa maala" of almost all Indian languages resembles that of Samskrutam and this "lipi" system is basically Samskrutam, many parents have found it fun and easy to follow it up at home and get the kids to practice their own language alphabet-system. Parents speaking Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Gujatathi and Hindi appear to find it useful!



  

Unfortunately, not being very computer-savy, I am still trying to discover/learn to upload the whole thing to some where!! (Of course, there is no copyright and is not going to be any on this system).

  

Hence, my abiding curiosity about your book.

  

Regards,

  

Iyengar

Subject: CUP have published my book  
  
  
  
Dear all,  

You'll be happy to know that the Cambridge University Press (CUP) have published my book titled 'Introducing PARSIL' (Phonetic Alphabet for Romanization of Spellings in Indian Languages).

It's a paperback edition listed as ISBN 978-93-84463-38-0.

  

Many of my friends and well-wishers have sent congratulations to me on CUP publishing my book'Introducing PARSIL' and many of them have frankly said that they are not at all familiar with the subject but still they will try to have a look at my book. I must match their frankness and I frankly say the following:

\* my book is not a fiction and so some of my friends may not find it easy to read (nor enjoyable!) and so I am attaching extracts from the book's Preface, the Foreword, a write up from Vienna, the acknowledgements, and the first chapter of the book for you scholars to get an overview of the book. For people like me, I am also attaching the book's Appendix A for explanation of the various terms used in the book.

\*(*ha ha ha*: the book might be good to read if you can't get sleep or are really fed up with life. When you read it you might suddenly realize that you were much better off a few minutes before you started reading the book!!!).

\* atbest,the book may be kept in the house like you keep a dictionary (this one for referring to it when you wish to Romanize an Indian Language word, the pronunciation of which you wish does not get distorted when the Romanized version is read out aloud. In the book one will find, in a tabulated form, the symbols of various other writing systems available today and one may choose any one from among them for the Romanization of their chosen Indian Language word).

  

\*The base of the book is linguistics and phonetics (of course the elementary level, which is mine!)

  

...Regards...Shreyas
