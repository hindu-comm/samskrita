Respected Shripaad Abhyankar Sir,

You say **"I do realize that** **I am too small a person ".**



No. No. Sir! What you don't realize is the fact that you are one of the most admirable persons I have come in contact with in my life. You occupy a very special place in my mind and heart.To selflessly teach Sanskrit through ShrimadBhagvadGeeta is an endeavor which showers double benefits to the readers and learners, and speaks volumes about your scholarship and karma-yoga spirit!. And for what you have donenow with my attachments, I remain eternally grateful to you. You have now made my 'writing effort' accessible to everyone! Yes Sir, that is an undeniable fact for me. (Incidentally, my son, Rajan, who is in San Fransisco has also done a similar thing).  


By addressing to [sams...@googlegroups.com]() you have made the attachments accessible to all the members of the fraternity. Now do I have your permission to forward your mail to my personal friends who have not been able to open the attachments ? To some I have already forwarded my son's mail but your presentation looks very neat and inspiring. That is why I am asking for the permission, Sir.

Thanks and Regards...Shreyas

Subject: Re: \[Samskrita\] CUP have published my book  

नमस्ते श्रीमन् श्रेयस्-मुन्शी-महोदय !  

जानामि यद्भवन्तम् अभिनन्दितुम् अहं तु कश्चिन्नगण्यः \|  
I do realize that I am too small a person to congratulate you on your great work.  

पठितं अनेकानां सन्देशेषु यत् तेभ्यः कतिचित् कष्टप्रदमभवत् भवतः लेखानां सङ्ग्रहणम् \|  
In many responses I read about their difficulty in downloading your files.  

अभवत् किञ्चित् काठिण्यं मह्यमपि \| तथापिगुगल्-ड्राइव्ह्-मध्ये स्थापने नासीत् किमपि \|  
I too had some difficulty. But it got done easily when I put the files in Google-Drive.  

तथोपरि मया सर्वान् पृष्ठान् मिलित्वा एकैव पीडीएफ्-सङ्ग्राहिकापि जनिता \|  

Thereafter I was able to also generate a single PDF-file of all documents together.  

सहर्षं संयुक्ता सा अत्रैव \|  

Glad to attach it here.  

  

सस्नेहम्  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः ।  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"
