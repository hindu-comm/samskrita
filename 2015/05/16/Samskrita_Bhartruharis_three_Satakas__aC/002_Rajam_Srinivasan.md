Respected Sir;

  

You have my deepest gratitude for this gift. This will be most extensively used by me in my class (in a Hindu temple in New York) and I am absolutely certain that the students (of all ages) will be delighted to no end. Your blog will probably be most used for a while and I hope that the Temple can make this a part of their Summer Institute 2015.

  

Thank you again.

  

Warm regards,

  

Iyengar
