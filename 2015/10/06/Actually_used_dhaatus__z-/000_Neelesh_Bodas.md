Dear Members,

  

I recently read that while there are \~2000 (औपदेशिक ) dhaatus in dhatupath, only around 800 of them are actually seen used inलौकिक and वैदिक वाङ्मय combined. (If I recollect right, this was researched by [V.K. Rajwade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishwanath_Kashinath_Rajwade).) Further, 200 of these 800 are seen only in वैदिक वाङ्मय.

  

Does anybody know if this list of "actually used" dhaatus available anywhere? (online / print)
