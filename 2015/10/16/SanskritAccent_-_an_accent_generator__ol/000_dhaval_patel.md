Dear all,  

  
We are happy to present before you our project SanskritAccent - a computational simulation of फिट्सूत्रs.  

  
**Expected outcome** -  
1. The code converts an unaccented word into accented version with help of फिट्सूत्रs.  
e.g. कश्यप -> कश्य॑प.  

2\. The code also shows the फिट्सूत्र responsible for the accent (in this case पान्तानां गुर्वादीनाम् ).  

  
  
**Source code** - <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/>  

**Online testing** - <http://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritAccent/accent.html>  
  

  

  

**N.B.** -  
1. Currently we have considered only फिट्सूत्रs. धातुस्वरः, समासस्वरः and प्रत्ययस्वरः are not incorporated as of yet.  

2\. Bug reports are welcome at
<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/issues>.  

3\. We have relied on three books - (1) zAntanava's phiTsUtras by F. Kielhorn (2) svarasiddhAntacandrikA of zrInivAsayajvan and (3) siddhAntakaumudI with subodhinI commentary.  

4\. Current version is version 1.0.1 (<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/releases/tag/v1.0.1>)

Thaking you,
