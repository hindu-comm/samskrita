The Shrimad Bhagavadgita is a very special text for India and Indians. It has invited several hundreds of highly erudite and profound commentaries arising from all the Indian schools of philosophy. All six schools of Vedanta have written brilliant and highly incisive commentaries on the Shrimad Bhagavadgita, augmenting their own schools and propounding the path of liberation as per their traditions.

  

One of the most prominent traditions in Vedanta, after Shankara, is the tradition of Acarya Madhva (1238 - 1317 CE). [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhvacharya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhvacharya)

  

Raghavendra Yati (1598 - 1671 CE) is one of the best known exponents of the Madhva school.
