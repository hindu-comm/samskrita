Dear List,

  

To the evergreen topic of whether Sanskrit - not the ancient आर्ष language of the Vedas but its later classical flavor - was, at any stage, a spoken language or it was only the literary language used by scholars to communicate their thoughts to each other, I can contribute my 2-paisas worth of information that I have gleaned from the कामसूत्र of वात्स्यायन.

  

अध्याय ४ of अधिकरण १ is about the behavior of a नागरक, a member of the upper gentry. In it at सूत्र १६, वात्स्यायन gives a list of 64 arts that a gentleman, a gentlewoman or a courtesan (गणिका) is expected to have acquired. Number 46 therein is 'देशभाषाविज्ञानम्’ knowledge of the (non-Sanskrit) local dialects. This insistence on knowing देशभाषा can perhaps indicate that the language other than the देशभाषा, viz. Sanskrit, was the language that these persons used by default. In other words, Sanskrit was their ordinary speaking language.

  

This default language is specifically mentioned by the name of 'Sanskrit' at another place. In सूत्र १.४.१४, the नागरक is asked to participate in गोष्ठी (१.४.३४ --- समानविद्याबुद्धिशीलवित्तवयसां सह वेश्याभिरनुरूपैरालापैरासनबन्धो गोष्ठी। १.४.३५ तत्र चैषां काव्यसमस्या कलासमस्या च।) Later at १.४.५० is a श्लोक which tells us the way of being successful at a गोष्ठी. वात्स्यायन says:

  

नात्यन्तं संस्कृतेनैव नात्यन्तं देशभाषया।

कथां गोष्ठीषु कथयॅंल्लोके बहुमतो भवेत्॥

  

A person is highly regarded in a गोष्ठी if he converses neither entirely in Sanskrit nor entirely in a local dialect. (He is fluent in Sanskrit and the dialect both.)

  

(Going by the internal evidence of certain historical facts alluded to by वात्स्यायन and external evidence such as mention of his work by others, copying his words by others etc., the period of वात्स्यायन is assigned by scholars to between the 2nd and 4ht century CE. See 'Social Life in Ancient India - Studies in Vatsyayana's Kamasutra' by HC Chakladar.)
