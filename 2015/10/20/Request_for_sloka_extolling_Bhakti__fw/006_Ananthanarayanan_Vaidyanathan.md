though not erudite enough to participate here.. and although the answer is posted, I thought I would share a stanza from Shivananda Lahari of Shankara.. again on Bhakthi  
  
****

**मार्गावर्तितपादुका पशुपतेरङ्गस्य कूर्चायते**

**गण्डूषाम्बुनिषेचनं पुररिपोर्दिव्याभिषेकायते।**

**किञ्चिद्भक्षितमांसशेषकबलं नव्योपहारायते**

**भक्तिः किं न करोत्यहो वनचरो भक्तावतंसायते॥६३॥**

**॥श्रीमत् शङ्करभगवत्पाद विरचिते शिवानन्द लहर्याम्॥**

**mārgāvartitapādukā paśupateraṅgasya kūrcāyate**

**gaṇḍūṣāmbuniṣecanaṁ puraripordivyābhiṣekāyate\|**

**kiñcidbhakṣitamāṁsaśeṣakabalaṁ navyopahārāyate**

**bhaktiḥ kiṁ na karotyaho vanacaro bhaktāvataṁsāyate\|\|63\|\|**

**\|\|śrīmat śaṅkarabhagavatpāda viracite śivānanda laharyām\|\|**

  

  

***free translation***

**what is there that sincere devotion cannot do?**

**The footwear that war worn out through wandering in the forest was all that the hunter could find to clean and adorn the body of Shiva**

**the water filling the mouth was used by the hunter to offer divine abhishekam to Shambu the vanquisher of the three worlds (puraripu.. the enemy of Tripuras)**

**Pieces of meat, which the hunter tasted first to see whether it would suit the Lords palate became the naivedyam or holy offering of fresh food for Shankara**

**And that obscure hunter became the greatest devotee of the Lord of Lords Parameshwara**..
