Dear members,

  

I am looking for a slokaextolling Bhakti.

  

meaning would be something like this:

  

If age is the criterion, how about dhruva?

If caste is the criterion, how about vidhura?

If human birth is the criterion, how about gajendra?

If janma, then how about the asura vibheeshana?

  

thanks
