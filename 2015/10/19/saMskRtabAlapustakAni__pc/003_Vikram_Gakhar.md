I am happy to know that you are interested in translating a book into Sanskrit.  
  
I am not sure why you are not able to access the Sanskrit stories on the storyweaver website. Could you please try this link and look for Sanskrit in the search box?  
<https://storyweaver.org.in/>  
  
Hopefully that should solve the problem. To do any translations, you need to create an account the the storyweaver website.  
  
Just to make sure that people do not duplicate efforts, I have created a tracking sheet:  
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gIBJVdyxJRH-QnHhiVwZxIly2CwoauR3GYyiksV8jYs/edit#gid=2>  
  
If you have a gmail ID, I can give you edit permission for the tracking sheet. Feel free to add on the tracking sheet what you plan to translate later or what you want others to translate for you to read. Once you are done with translating your chosen book(s), make sure to update the status on the tracking sheet and add the hyperlink to your translation.  

Hopefully many people will learn from and enjoy your translations!
