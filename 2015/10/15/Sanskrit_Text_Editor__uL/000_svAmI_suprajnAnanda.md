Dear All,

Namaste.

  

I typed some of the Sanskrit text in Baraha. To keep the text for further editing at later time, I need to keep the English Transliteration also.

  

I like to know if there is any Text Editor in which I can directly edit Sanskrit Unicodes? Thus the redundancy in keeping both the versions will be removed.
