Dear all,

  

Please see the mail on the subject which is self explanatory.

  

Ramesh.

  
  

Ramesh,



I am glad you added a note to your message that the text of VishnusahasranAmastotra is from Garudapurana as there is no mention anywhere else it being of dhanvantari.



Please compare

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_vishhnu/viShNusahasranAmastotragaruDapurANa.html>

(nAmAvalI is pending) or

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_purana/garuDapurANa.html>

and the attached portion from table of contents with chapter 15 highlighted.



Just raising a concern,

I am not sure why professor Krishnamurthy would term it as dhanvantari (viShNu)sahasranAma.

For the benefit of doubt, I can assume it to be an oversight, but is clearly a distotion that needs correction unless there is a ligitimate reference and reason.

May be it suits his Ayurvedic practice like something to offer to his patients, and promotes his site[suvacha.com](http://suvacha.com/).



I had written to him earlier but did not receive any response.
(<http://www.slideshare.net/srimuliya/contra-indication-of-ayurvedic-medicine-dr-ms-krishnamurthy>and<http://alvasayurveda.com/staff.html>half way down)

I hope he makes the correction in his PDF files.



You can letSamskrita group know of the misrepresentation.

Thanks.
