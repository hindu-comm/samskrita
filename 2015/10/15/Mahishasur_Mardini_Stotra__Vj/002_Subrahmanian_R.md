I agree with Sri Abhyankar mahasayas statement that in अयिगिरि नन्दिनि the pattern is in good discipline in all lines, but I beg to differ from him as to the reasons for justification.

A पद्य is a वृत्त or जाति. A वृत्त is a stanza, the metre of which is regulated by the number and position of syllables in each पाद or quarter. A जाति is stanza the metre of which is regulated by the number of syllable instants in each quarter.

अयिगिरि नन्दिनि sloka falls in the latter category. One may further say that each line or पाद consists of eight portions, each of the first seven portions has four syllabic instants, while the eighth portion consists of one long syllable (गुरु). The two stanzas quoted conform to this norm, as do the other stanzas of this sloka.

Incidentally, Kavi Kalidasa's का त्वम् बाले, the नाम रामयण (शुद्धब्रह्म परात्पर राम्), मधुराष्टकम् (अधरं मधुरं वदनं मधुरम्), and the Hindi (or Marathi?) रघुपति राघव राजाराम etc fall in this जाति type of metre. Its characteristic reminds one of the चतुस्र गति of कर्नाटक संगीत. Out of the above only in मधुराष्टकम्, the last portion of each line also contains four syllabic instants.

However, I am perplexed as to how, in का त्वम् बाले - the last portion क ख ग घ conforms to the metre or prosody. All the four are short syllables or लघु. Also in Raghupati raghava, a vowel in पतित and भगवन् appear to have been elongated to पतीत and भगवान्. Possibly it conforms to the local language in which it is composed.

　With profound respect to all

 R Subrahmanian
