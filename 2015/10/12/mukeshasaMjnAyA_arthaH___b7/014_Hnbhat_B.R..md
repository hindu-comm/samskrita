I could not find any story of a crow in the verse.

  

It simply prays Varahi to drive away and chase away in all directions each other the enemies named such and such (without any specific name)
like the crows. काकवद् भ्रमयाशु तान्।

  

The crows do not have any name to identify each other and the aggregate of the enemies are to be warded off away even if any name is not to be mentioned. This is related to the previous sentences.
