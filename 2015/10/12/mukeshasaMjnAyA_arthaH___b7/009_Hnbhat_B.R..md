Thanks for solving the meaning of मुकेश - the lord of the smell of cowdung.

  

I think the question raised is solved.

  

But I could not find in the word in Apte's dictionary and this is the search result:



"not found: muka"  

  

Nor in Monier Williams dictionary or any Sanskrit Dictionary.

  

  

  

Regarding the word अमुक, please go through this discussion in another google group:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/YplbNOkT28I/XdaMY8LqoasJ>  

  

Here is the Sanskrit Dictionary search result:

  

अमुक¦ त्रि० अदस् + टेरकच् उत्त्वमत्वे । अदःशब्दार्थे

“अत्राहममुकः साक्षी” “समाप्तेऽर्थे ऋणी नाम स्वहस्तेन

निवेशयेत् मतं मेऽमुकपुत्रस्थ यदत्रोपरि लेखितम्” च या०

  

Anyhow you have solved the question of मुकेश one who is having the smell of cowdung! Thanks once again.
