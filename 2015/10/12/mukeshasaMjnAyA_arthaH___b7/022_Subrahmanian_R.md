Sirs,

वृषाली: - Sri Anand Ghurye has observed that according to Wikipedia the name of Karna's wife was Vrushali. I find that Karna was known also as Vasusena as well as Vrusha. Possibly Vrushali is derived from Vrusha, the name of Karna. I am not competent to define the word, nor assert that Vrushali is from Vrusha. I find from Sankarabhashyam of Vishnusahasranamam वृष: is explained as कामान् वर्षणात् वृष:, धर्म:. there are nine other names of Lord Vishnu all of which are connected with Vrusha: Dharma:. The book 'विग्रह कोश:' defines वृष: as: अभिलषितं वर्षति फलमिति वृष: and वृषा as वर्षतीति वृषा. The vigraha for वृषल: is unclear to me: वृषलुनाति इति वृषल:, then perhaps in Marathi घर्मनाश करितो. Of course, for all these some other meaning is also mentioned in Marathi or so; though it is not clear enough to me for reproduction, it is same as or close to what Dr Bhatt has explained.

With respects to all.

R Subrahmanian
