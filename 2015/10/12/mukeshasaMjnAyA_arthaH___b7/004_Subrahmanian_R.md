More common I think is आर्ति or आर्ती. The dictionary meaning does not appear to be pleasing. Also आरतिonly means stopping, ceasing. Perhaps आरात्रिक got changed to आर्ति after shedding some end portion. Similar to my mind, is अस्मिता. I am told that it has nothing to do with laughter or smile, but 'I am'-ness !
