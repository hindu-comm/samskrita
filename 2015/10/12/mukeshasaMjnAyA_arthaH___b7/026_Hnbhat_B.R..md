I find that Karna was known also as Vasusena as well as Vrusha. Possibly Vrushali is derived from Vrusha, the name of Karna. I am not competent to define the word, nor assert that Vrushali is from Vrusha.

  
I could not support your assumption and have given the derivations for
वृषल. For the name वृष, it has been used in respect of seven persons in Mahabharata itself:

**vṛṣa**

\[L=12293\]\[p=[753-1](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/INMScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=753)\]  
**Vṛsha**^1¦ = Karṇa, q.v.\[L=12294\]  
**Vṛsha**^2,¦ a Kuru warrior. § 592 (Saṃçaptakavadhap.): VII,  
**20(greek),**804 (in Droṇa's gāruḍavyūha; B. has*Vṛshakrātho,*  
cf. Krātha^2).\[L=12295\]  
**Vṛsha**^3,¦ a warrior of Skanda. § 615*u*(Skanda): IX,**45(greek),**  
2566.\[L=12296\]  
**Vṛsha**^4,¦ an Asura(?). § 673*b*(Bali-Vāsavasaṃv.): XII,  
**227(greek),**8263 (among the ancient rulers of the earth).\[L=12297\]  
**Vṛsha**^5¦ = Çiva: II, 1642; XII, 10372 (1000 names^1);  
XIV, 199.\[L=12298\]  
**Vṛsha**^6¦ = Dharma: VII, 9627; XII, 3378.\[L=12299\]  
**Vṛsha**^7¦ = Kṛshṇa (Vishṇu): XII, 1507, 13247 (etymology);  
XIII, 6983 (1000 names), 7030 (do.).
