There is nothing to think. Really if कर्ण is सूत्रपुत्र, his wife would be a वृषली. What about the name शुनःशेफः the disciple of विश्वामित्र? There is nothing at all in the naming. The vulgar meaning it can give.
शिश्नो मेढ्रं मेहनशेफसी ( २. ६. ६८२). शुनो The same with another disciple whose name is पशुमेढ्रः. "मध्यमश्च *शुनःशेफः* *शुनः पुच्छः* कनिष्ठकः ॥६४॥"

  

  

There are two names of for a lover:

  

कामुकी and कामुका; "कामुकी भवति मैथुनेच्छा चेत् । "

कामुकान्येति। धनादीच्छावतीत्यर्थः। So these are the two names for a lover.  

  

  

वृषली  

f\. a woman of low caste,  

  

I think it is not the name of wife of Karna.
