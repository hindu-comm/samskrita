In the ramakrishna mutt publication of Devi mahatmyam written by Anna in tamil, I came across the wordअमुक in the sankalpa portion, it is written to useअमुक - with a comment stating to think of our own desire for which the paraayanam is done. Intrigued, I checked and got this meaning:  

  

अमुक - such and such person or a thing; a thing or a person referred to without a name.  

  

Similar toAmukagotra Shriamukadevasharma (the host) kriteysmin. Lekhani masyadhara sahita Shri Shri Saraswati puja tat anghibuta puja karmanah..

Thoughtमुक should be - a person or a thing with name (considering it to be the antonym), but was shocked when the meaning obtained was this:-

  

मुक- smell of cowdung  

  

then what is the antonym ofमुक?

  

Or am I landing into trouble like this:

  

Many words from Samskritam has been translated to English and accepted, yet when they are translated back to Samskritam, they yield a different result. For eg, chitta is translated to mind. manas also is translated to mind. But how will you translate "mind" back to Samskritam -> chitta or manas? Yoga has been translated to union, but is union translated back to Samskritam as Yoga?

Just sharing my views, corrections most welcome.
