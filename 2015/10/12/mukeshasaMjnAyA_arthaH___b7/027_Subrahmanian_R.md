Bhatt Sir,



Thank you for the clarification and the additional information. I did notice that Vrisha is among the 1000 names and mentioned so in my mail; also that the meaning for that (ie. as one of the 1000 names of Vishnu), the meaning given was Dharma. I seek to know from you if the sixth name Dharma here means Yudhishthira's father, God of Dharma, Yama.



With respects

R Subrahmanian
