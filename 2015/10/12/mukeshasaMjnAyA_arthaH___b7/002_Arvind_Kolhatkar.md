I have always said that people tend to choose, create or invent names that sound 'ethnic' and 'traditional' without bothering to check if their concocted name has any meaning or not. This can sometimes lead to hilarious results.

  

Here is the [website](https://www.facebook.com/shleshma.adhikari) of someone whose name is - can you believe it - 'श्लेष्मा'! New-born girls are routinely named 'वृषाली' without realizing that this name does not have a very complimentary meaning.

  

The same is the case withमुकेश. There is no word in the Sanskrit language like 'मुक'. You have मूक, you also have मुख, but no 'मुक'.
Consequently, , मुक + ईश is meaningless, though because of the 'ईश' ending it sounds like good old Sanskrit.

  

This has been often commented upon here.
