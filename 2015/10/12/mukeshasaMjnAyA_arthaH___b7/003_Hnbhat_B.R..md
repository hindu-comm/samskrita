Very interesting. The first is meaningful, but not only not interesting as a personal name, but ugly as

*m.*\[श्लिष्-मनिन्\] Phlegmatic  
humour.

as per Apte's Dictionary. Dr. Narayanan would explain the word correctly.

As Sanskrit name वृषली has got several meaning of choice:

*ī*), f. a woman of low caste;  
anunmarried girl twelve years old (in whom menstru  
ation has commenced);  
a woman during menstruation;  
a barren woman; the mother of a still-born child.

But वृषाली would give give more uglier / vulgar meaning as in

"वृषस्यन्ती तु कामुकी"

etc.
