The name asura is not noted in the dictionary entries. Please provide the source or dictionary entry showing it as the name of a asura. But it is मूक which name is shared by three personages, of which is the name of a demon you mentioned according to Puranic Encyclopedia ::

**mūka**

\[L=4595\]\[p=[507](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=507),2\]MŪKA I. A serpent born of the family of Takṣaka.  
This serpent was burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of  
Janamejaya. (Śloka 9, Chapter 5, Ādi Parva).

\[L=4596\]MŪKA II. An asura. This demon once went to  
Arjuna who was engaged in penance in the forests. He  
had assumed the form of a boar and Arjuna killed  
him. At once Śiva appeared there in the guise of a  
forester and contended that the boar was killed by him.  
A quarrel ensued which ended in a fight between  
them. In the end Śiva appeared before Arjuna in his  
real form and granted him the missile Pāśupata. (See  
under Arjuna).

\[L=4597\]MŪKA III. A Caṇḍāla devoted much to his parents.  
A Brāhmaṇa named Narottama went to this caṇḍāla  
to learn moral lessons from him. (Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa,  
Padma Purāṇa).  
  
  
  

Now my 2 questions are yet to be answered:  
\>  
\> 1) What is the antonym ofमुक ? I am sure it is definitely notअमुक.

Why not अमुकः? न मुकः अमुकः = not having cowdung smell. Or any other meaning the word मुक!

\> 2) the story of the cow in

What is the question here?
