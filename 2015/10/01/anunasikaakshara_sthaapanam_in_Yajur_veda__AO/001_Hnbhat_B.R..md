Why do you repeat the same thing verbatim as you have posted in the relate thread?

You have not answered my question first of all where the अनुस्वार comes first and proceed to Vedic pronunciation according to शिक्षा-s , nwhich are more than 20 or 30, according to the शाखा-s they relate.
पाणिनीयशिक्षा itself 4 or five versions which are different in the text which is considered as वेदाङ्ग. The other शिक्षा-s numbering more than 30 (approximately) have their own views on pronunciation in addition to प्रातिशाख्य for each Veda. How you can declare only the pronunciation according to कृष्णयुर्वेद and Vedavyasa शिक्षा is only authentic as you have learnt?
