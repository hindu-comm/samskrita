@ Arvind: I am not sure if these lines are really from any old text or just used as common text in varietyof context. But I found certain references to this text in context of Lord Krishna in some book (I lost the reference) and therefore I am checking if there's any specifiec slok associated with the text.

  

@Shankara: No, I am refering to Narendra Kohli's novel on Swami Vivekananda.

  

Thanks,

Saurabh
