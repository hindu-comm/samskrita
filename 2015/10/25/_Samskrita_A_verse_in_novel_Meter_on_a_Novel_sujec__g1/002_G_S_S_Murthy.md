Many thanks, Aravindji. I circulated the composition as it has been published by a reputed periodical having reputed scholars on its editorial board. I strongly believe in broadening the stream of Sanskrit literature and mercifully there are many scholars who encourage such attempts.

Regards,

Murthy
