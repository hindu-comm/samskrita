\*jd. the root \>rabh can be studied for its Classical senses

like any common root

in its verbal compounds

in the Capeller entries

found in

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html>


on the Dictionary dropdown list



for example



#rabh -> #rambh –> ##rabh -> #rambh – Cap. –rabhate, -ti (rambhti, -te)}, pp. {rabdha} (--- w. act. & pass. mg) take hold, seize, embrace. C. {rambhayami} & D. {ripsate} (only ---). -- {anu} grasp, seize. {A} take hold upon, touch, seize, lean or stay upon (acc.), reach to, attain; undertake, begin to (acc. or infin.). {anvA} take hold of from behind, hold on to (acc.). {samanvA} take hold of each other or together. {abhyA} grasp, touch, get at, undertake, begin. {prA} & {samA} the same. {pari} & {saMpari} embrace (together). {sam} take hold of (each other), seize upon, partake of, enjoy (instr.); M.

as entries for my CGlossary.

exercises like this increase your eppreciation of the *sense* of these prefixes.

some have fuzzy meaning (like #vi, not in the above example) which may imply both infusion and dispersion.

**.Q.** are there any existing lists like this (I call it a Capeller list)?

compiling such a list would not be easy

but would be a helpful thing for English-reading students of the Classics.
