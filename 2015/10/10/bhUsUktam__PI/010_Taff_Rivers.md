Pramod,  
  
The given URL is that of the file, not of the website of that sources that file.  
  
The link will download the file directly to your computer.  
  
The opening of it, will depend on your security settings and the existence of a suitable program that reads pdf's.  
  
As to the web site, the URL is <http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7431/>  
  
 The bhūsūktam which is of the vaiṣṇava persuasion,  
is to be found in the Appendix - B4.  
  
As to it being an 'earliest' or 'most authentic' rendition, Vedic scholars will have some context to work with.  
  
Presumably, the author of that pdf, can be contacted, as the source he cites is not particularly helpful.  
  
Then again, Harry Spier does not say where his extract comes from, either.  
  
Regards,  
  
 Taff
