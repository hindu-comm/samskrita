I didn't ask for the सवितृगायत्री which is popularly known as गायत्री, but the गायत्री to धरा which was asked for the source in the first post. I could not find it in the portions quoted by you:

Dear list members,  

Can any of the list members give me the scriptural reference for where thebhūsūktam comes from?  

I've seen an internet reference tomahānārāyaṇopaniṣad (28) but I haven't been able to find thebhūsūktamin themahānārāyaṇopaniṣad.  

The first few verses are from the Taittiriya Samhita 1.5.3 but I'm looking from where thebhūsūktam as a whole occurs because I'm looking for the scriptural source of the Gayatri mantra:

dhanurdharāyai vidmahe

sarvasiddhyai cadhīmahi

tanno dharāpracodayāt

  
Please check and inform. I was planning to look up in the तैत्तिरीयारण्यक where several Gayatri-s are found.
