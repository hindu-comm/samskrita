Dear list members,

  

Can any of the list members give me the scriptural reference for where thebhūsūktam comes from?

  

I've seen an internet reference tomahānārāyaṇopaniṣad (28) but I haven't been able to find thebhūsūktamin themahānārāyaṇopaniṣad.

  

The first few verses are from the Taittiriya Samhita 1.5.3 but I'm looking from where thebhūsūktam as a whole occurs because I'm looking for the scriptural source of the Gayatri mantra:

dhanurdharāyai vidmahe

sarvasiddhyai ca dhīmahi

tanno dharā pracodayāt



which is part of the bhūsūktam.

  

I've searched the on-line resources (Bloomfields Concordance, GRETIL and Muktabodha) and haven't found it.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
