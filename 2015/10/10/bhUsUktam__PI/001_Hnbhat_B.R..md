It may not be available as it is recited in the most versions. It is said it belongs to TaittiriyaSukta and most probably it may be found in Khila portions. Like the Ganapatyatharva, you may find it in Aranyaka portion. Most of the Sukta-s are not named in the Samhita Texts, but compiled later with additions. In Rigveda also you can find many Sukta-s on the Khila portion, which are popularly spread by the names श्रीसूक्त, मेधासूक्त etc. depending on the initial Mantra, here it is भूमि popularly named भूसूक्त.

  

The later verses may be from some Puranic literature, or added to the Samhita text in the Khila portion. The whole known as भूसूक्त with the गायत्री added to each सूक्त. ;

  

They need not be in a single place or there may be anushtup verses with or without accentuation, as can be seen in श्रीसूक्त, verses in classical language.
