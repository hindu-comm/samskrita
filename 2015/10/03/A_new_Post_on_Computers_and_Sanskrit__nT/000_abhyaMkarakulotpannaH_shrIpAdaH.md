नमांसि !

  

Thoughts on Computers and Sanskrit have been appearing on different forums.

  

I have my own thoughts on the subject and thought it good to compile them in a Post on [Computers and Sanskrit](https://samskrutacharchaa.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/computers-and-sanskrit/)just uploaded.

  

I prepared it as a Google document and shared it with a few learned people known to me. But I have been continuously editing and expanding.

  

Thinking that now it is in a shape to upload it as a post, I have done that and would look forward to criticisms and comments, for which I shall be ever obliged.
