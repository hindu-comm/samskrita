Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

The wordएकदन्ताय doesn't appear in this file. The link you've given me appears to be a devanagari version of Bloomfields Vedic Concordance.
I've checked the digital Bloomfields Vedic concordance from Harvard (covering the Vedic literature),the GRETIL digital library ( a general survey of the Sanskrit literature) and the Muktabodha digital library (the Tantric literature) and none of them have the word "ekadantāya". 
My understanding is that theGaṇapatyarthavaśīrṣa only dates from the 17th century so I had assumed this Ganesha gayatri mantra predated it.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
