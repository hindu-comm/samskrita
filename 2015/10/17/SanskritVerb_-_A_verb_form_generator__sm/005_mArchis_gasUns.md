We are happy to see the results, words hardly describe my thankfulness.

Not only good, but open code. Documentation will follow, I'm sure.

If "कर्तृवाच्य Mandatory field. Wait for ajax to load." is mandatory, why do I have to click on it? Can you make it checked already?

If I enter kalpate, do I use it correctly?
