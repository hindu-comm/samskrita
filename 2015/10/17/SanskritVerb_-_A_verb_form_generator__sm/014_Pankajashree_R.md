Thank you for this resource. Very helpful. 

  

Also, I would like to know if there is an API to get verb forms and English meaning if we input a root?

  

I have seen UOHYD's work regarding verb form generator:

  

[http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/#  
](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/#)

  

This is a sample output for a root

  

<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/cgi-bin/scl/skt_gen/verb/verb_gen.cgi?prayoga=%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF&vb=%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D1_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%81_%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%83_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%83&encoding=Unicode&upasarga=-&paxI=parasmEpaxI>  

  

and this gives meanings and synonyms -

Are these programs and databases open source?

  

If not, are there any APIs which give JSON outputs for the verb forms and meanings?
