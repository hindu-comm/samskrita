Dear Dr. Patel,  

  
The tool is very useful and informative. Thank you.  
  
Is there a facility for the reverse query, i.e., given a form like "आसम्" is there a facility to tell what are all the possible ways by which it can be arrived at?  
I think that would be useful while reading an existing text and trying to understand the meaning. (Eg: I came across a word recently -- तेनैवासमितीरयन् -- तेन+एव+**आसाम्**+इति+ईरयन् ).  
  
Regards,  
Pradyumna
