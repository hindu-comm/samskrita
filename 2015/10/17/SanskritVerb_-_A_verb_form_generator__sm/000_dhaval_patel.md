Dear scholars,  
  

We are happy to present before you our project **SanskritVerb** - a computational simulation of step by step Sanskrit verb form generation (तिङन्तप्रक्रिया).  
  

**Expected outcome** -  

1\. The code gives step by step derivation of all forms of a given verb in given tense.  

2\. The code gives a derived table at the end.  
  

**Source code** - <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb>  

**Online testing** - <http://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/tiGanta.html>  
  

**N.B.** -  

1\. Currently the machine doesn't create sanAdi verb forms. It will be included in later versions.  

2\. Bug reports are welcome at <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues>  

3\. We have relied upon the following books - (1) Ashtadhyayi sahajabodha by Dr. Pushpa Dikshit, (2) Siddhantakaumudi with Balamanorama commentary and (3) Kashikavritti.  

4\. Current version is version 1.1.0 (<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/releases/tag/v1.1.0>)  

  
Thanking you,  
  
Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S and Dr. Shivakumari Katuri
