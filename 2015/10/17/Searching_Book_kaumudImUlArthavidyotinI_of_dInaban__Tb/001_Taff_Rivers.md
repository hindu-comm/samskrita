These things are not hard to find.  
  
Even is their original manuscript form, as in this case.  
  
Books are often printed on-demand these days, even from within the local high street bookshop, while you wait.  
  
  
 Random finds...  
  
 A Paper Book: (expensive)  
  

<http://www.amazon.com/The-Siddhanta-kaumudi-Bhattoji-Dikshita/dp/5518504373>  
  
  
 An e-book (free to download, but many MBs!)  
  
 
<http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2011/02/siddhanta-kaumudi-sanskrit-english-commentary-saradaranjan-ray-kumudranjan-ray/>  
  
  
Hovever, these particular volumes appear to assume that the reader is bi-lingual. As a Devanagari word of the source text is simply commentated on in English without an equivalent meaning being given in English!  
  
Your results, will depend on which search engines you use and from which O/S platform.  
  
 Cheers,
