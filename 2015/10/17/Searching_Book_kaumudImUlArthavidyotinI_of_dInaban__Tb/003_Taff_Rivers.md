I don't know how Taff's post is related to my requested. ???? [](http://www.worldcat.org/title/kaumudi-mularthavidyotini/oclc/18589389)  

  
 From where I am, I read:  
  
"कौमुदीमूलार्थविद्योतिनी (kaṛmudīmūlārthavidyotinī) of दीनबन्धुझा (dīnabandhujhā)"  

  
 Please, check this page on WorldCat for details:

I duly check, and I read:  
  
Jhā, Dīnabandhu, 1878-1955.  
Kaumudī-mūlārthavidyotinī.  
Darabhaṅgā, Bihāraḥ : Kāmeśvarasiṃha-Darabhaṅgā-Saṃskr̥ta-Viśvavidyālayaḥ, 1986  
(OCoLC)625503843  
Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita.  
Government publication, State or province government publication  
  
But, where does "navya-nyAya-*language*", come into things, which I take to mean navya-nyAya-*philosophy*,  
  
That of course is an entirely different work, I have a commentated work (book/ volume )of same.  
Again not exactly hard to find?  
  
I can only think that my Devanagari or English transliterations (as above) are not the same as yours.  
  
  
Please let me view c*ommentary* if and when it arrives, that I better understand in future.  
  
  
Cheers,
