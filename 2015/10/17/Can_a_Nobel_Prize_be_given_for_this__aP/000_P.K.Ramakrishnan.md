Ramayana balakaanda sarga 17 sloka 19

  

idam tu narasaardula paayasam devanirmitam /

prajaakaram grihaana tvam dhanyamaarogyavardhanam //

bhaaryaanaamanurupaanaam asniteti prayaccha vai /

taasu tvam praapyase putraan yadartham yajase nrupa //

  

A Nobel prize can be given to a person. But the person who

made this is said be the devaas. And who handed this is not

mentioned in the Ramayana. After giving the paayasam to Dasaratha

he asked him to feed his wives. He also said then he would get children

in them.
