My name is Tomasz P. Szynalski.  
I also made Antimoon — a site which tells people how to learn English effectively.  
I am a part-time English-Polish translator, offering Polish translation services online.  
I publish some of the practical stuff here. I live in Wrocław, Poland.  
  
Should anyone actually need an Indian English 'IPA':  
  
***A number of distinctive features of Indian English*** are due to "the vagaries English spelling".\[23\] Most Indian languages, unlike English, have a nearly phonetic spelling, so the spelling of a word is a highly reliable guide to its modern pronunciation. Indians' tendency to pronounce English phonetically as well can causefrom Western English.  
  
For example, "jewellery" is pronounced /dʒʋeləriː/ and "jewehh l" as /dʒʋel/ where Western Anglophones might omit the final e, pronouncing them as /dʒʋelriː/ and /dʒʋl/.  
  
In words where the digraph \<gh> represents a voiced velar plosive (/ɡ/) in other accents, some  
Indian English speakers supply a murmured version \[ɡʱ\], for example \<ghost> \[ɡʱoːst\]. No other accent of English admits this voiced aspiration.\[19\]  
  
Similarly, the digraph \<wh> may be aspirated as \[ʋʱ\] or \[wʱ\], resulting in realisations such as \<which> \[ʋʱɪtʃ\], found in no other English accent.\[24\]  
  
However, this is somewhat similar to the traditional distinction between wh and w present in English, wherein the former is /ʍ/, whilst the latter is /w/.  
  
In unstressed syllables, which speakers of American English would realise as a *schwa*, speakers of Indian English would use the spelling vowel, making \<sanity> sound as \[ˈsæniti\] instead of \[ˈsænəti\].  
  
This trait is also present in other South Asian dialects (i.e. Pakistani and Sri Lankan English), and in RP, etc.Similarly, \<above> and \<ago> can be heard as \[eːˈbəv\] and \[eːˈɡoː\] instead of \[əˈbʌv\] and \[əˈɡoʊ\].\[citation needed\]  
  
And finally, *are you listening Mr. Ken*:  
  
Final \<a> is almost always pronounced as schwa /ə/ in other dialects (exceptions include words such as \<spa>);  
but in Indian English the ending \<a> is pronounced as the long open central unrounded vowel /aː/ (as in \<spa>) instead of /ə/.  
So, \<India> is pronounced as /ˈɪnɖɪaː/ instead of /ˈɪndɪə/, and \<sofa> as /ˈsoːfaː/ instead of /ˈsoʊfə/.\[citation needed\]
