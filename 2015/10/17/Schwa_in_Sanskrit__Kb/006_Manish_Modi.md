Dear Taff,

  

I have been reading the discussion between you and Ken with great interest. Both of you have argued your views with coherence.

  

Please do not bring down the level of discussions to personal accusations by questioning Ken's nationality. So what if he is Polish? He is talking about India and Indians and has every right to do so.

  

I am an Indian and can insightfully discuss the writings of Steinbeck. I need not be California-born to appreciate Steinbeck or Mississippi-born to discuss Mark Twain.

  

Best regards,

Manish
