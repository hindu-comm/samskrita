Ken,

  
  
 "English words pronunciations can easily be written in easy to learn and type IAST scheme which is transliteratable in to regional languages."  
  

**IAST**  
 The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (I.A.S.T.) is a transliteration scheme that allows a **lossless** romanization of **Indic** scripts as employed by the Sanskrit language.  
  
  
**Indic scripts  
  
** As far as I'm aware, neither British or American English, are *Indic scripts*.  
 I have always understood them to be *Latin* scripts.  
  
**Lossless transliteration  
  
** Again, what I understand by these words, is that when I convert from one script to the other, and back again, I get exactly what I started with.  
  
**Lossless**  
  
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that in *Sanskrit*, at least in the Classical variety, there is a one to one relationship between the visible letter (/sign/glyph) of the Devanagari *script* and the unheard sound of that letter.  
 This compares to my understanding of *English*, of any variety, where there is a one to many relationship - as exemplfied by the letter 'a'.  
  
I stand to be corrected, but my reasoning leads me to conclude that using IAST, other than where there exists a one to one relationship, is of no use to anyone.  
  
The proof being in the pudding - do you find it useful? If so for what.  
  
  
Once again, please!  
  
Not only does IPA come in a variety of flavours, but also there is not even a one to one relationship between a 'letter' and a sound, in any IPA.  
  
When used *correctly* as intended, both the IAST nor IPA encoding systems require t*he corresponding sounds are to hand*, in one form or another:  
  
- as a written description of the sound - the the reader will have to have the associated sound already in the head, from a previous hearing.  
- as an audio presentation of the sound.  
  
  
As to your 'Schwa'!  
  
 "Since letter 'a ' has 3 to 4 sounds (a,aa,ae /above,art,at)) in English I prefer 'a' as There are a number of sounds indicated by that string of letters."  
  
In the English that I know, there are rather more than '3 or 4'!  
  
And that goes for your *Schwa,* as well, there are rather more than the one *sound*.  
  
  
 Arghhh!  
  
 Taff  
  
Confucius, he say, man who put quart in pint pot, not to make tea.  
  
Taff, he say, a liittle ignorance go a long way, before go bump!  
  
  
**This** is not *Sanskrit!*
