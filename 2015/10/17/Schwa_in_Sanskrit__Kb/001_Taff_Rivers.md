Ken,  
  
I come not to Schwa, but to notate.  
  

  
"These IAST sounds (a,ai,au ) are confusing to English speakers who read Sanskrit in Roman script."  
  
  

***Somebody*** is confusing something!. Devanagari, a script, with Sanskrit, a language, or rather two languages Vedic and Classic, and most obviously their English.- a large *group  
of languages*.  
  
Then there are notation systems....  
  
  
There is confusion in the eye of the beholder, and there is confusion in the beholden...  
... then there is confusion in both the beholder, and tthe beholden.  
  
To explain:  
  
a, ai and au are not a sounds, they are *symbols*, written symbols.  
  
As to how they 'sound' i.e. are pronounced, reference is to be made to the encoding system used.  
  
a ā i ī u ū æ e ai ô o au aṁ aḥ etc are symbols used in the IAST encoding system.  
  
For their sounds, one refers to the IAST encoding system, where one finds either a description of those sounds, or and audio of them - or both.  
  
IPA is only a description of those sounds. Again, IPA is not a (singular) description, but a *class of descriptions*:  
  
Viz.  
  
 AuE, Australian English  
 CaE, Canadian English  
 GA, General American  
 InE, Indian English  
 IrE, Irish English  
 NZE, New Zealand English  
 RP, Received Pronunciation (Standard in the United Kingdom)  
 ScE, Scottish English  
 SAE, South African English  
 SSE, Standard Singapore English  
 WaE, Welsh English  
  
As an English only speaker, and a British English speaker at that, I read the one IPA - *RP, Received Pronunciation (Standard in the United Kingdom)*  
(sometimes, also the *WaE, Welsh English,* as I am a non Welsh speaking Welshman.  
  
What matters is the vocalisation.  
  
Nobody speaks IPA!  
Better than unfamiliar IPA symbols, that nobody speaks, are pronunciation guides that use everyday native vocal speech sounds.  
  
viz:  
  
 *Received Pronunciation (Standard in the United Kingdom)*  
  
Vowels  
* a as in u in cut*  
 ā as in father  
 i as in bit  
 ī as in beet  
 u as in put or foot  
 ū as in brute  
 e as in bay (e.g. deva). In Pāli before a double consonant as in bed (e.g. metta)  
 ai as in sigh  
 o as in hope  
 au as in sound  
 ṛ as in cur  
 ṃ nasalise preceding vowel so that oṃ as in the French bon (although it is very common to hear it rhyme with bomb, I believe this is technically incorrect).  
 ḥ softly echoes the preceding vowel  
 ṝ rarely used in mantra, pronounce as for ṛ but longer.  
 ḷ and ḹ very rare in mantras. The tongue on the alveolar ridge (see diagram below). Sounds like the Japanese l/r. ḹ is longer.  
  
Notice the absence of the *America* as exemplifying an abuguity of notation of a a short a, which is certainly does not.  
That appears to have be taken from a West End musical, thats a different kind of notation alltogether - musical.  
  
It is usual to describe a symbol's sound in terms of a given encoding system.  
  
And your *Modified IAST* is not an IAST, not even an extended kind. It is a suggested Gujạlish notation.  
Not something your average Englishman as even heard of (I looked it up - the strange notation that is).  
  
Hereby to be a light upon the darkness.  
  
 Cheers,  
  
Taff
