Manish,  
  
  
 Language please!  
  
 Nationality as in native language.  
 Not as in associated connotations of the politically incorrect kind.  
  
 Under discussion is the proposal, by a native of Poland(?) that a customised (Polish?) 'IPA' be usefully employed  
 as a pronunciation guide - to Sanskrit.  
  
 The value or otherwise of that idea, has already been undertaken elsewhere in this forum.  
The conclusion, diplomatically presented there, was that it would probably of value - to the proposer  
(but, to read between the lines, to nobody else. In short, it is somewhat ill-conceived and rather useless.).  
  
  
To remain focused, and to keep things in proper perpective - a little critical analysis, of the pramāṇāni kind.  
  
Patañjali I. 7 Pratyakṣa-anumāna-āgamāḥ pramāṇāni.  
  
 along with a little nirodhaḥ of the said Patañjali kind, complete with vairāgyābhyām:  
  
Patañjali I. 12 Abhyāsa-vairāgyābhyām tan nirodhaḥ.  
  
  
So, to **IPA**, or not to **IPA**, then, is all really a question of common sense.  
  
  
 How did you, or anyone for that matter, learn your notate your thoughts as a toddler?  
  
Were you not presented with a picture of familiar things, e.g. of a cat, alongside some more pictures - of unfamilar things.  
  
Those unfamiliar things were symbols from an phonetic alphabet, were they not?  
  
May I hazard a guess that the phonetic alphabet in question was not any kind of 'IPA' - International Phonetic Alphabet,  
but was the somewhat customised and very parochial phonetics (VPP) of your parents or guardians.  
  
 Example. In approriate VPP notation:  
  
 picture of a pussy cat (use your imagination!) K A T  
  
But there is some essential element missing, that renders all my graphic artwork completely useless!  
  
Namely SOUND - of the VPP kind.  
  
An indigenous sound. Perhaps as an Indian national, it would be one or other of the multifarious Indian sounds.  
The were duly vocalised, but by whose vocals? A Polishman, Dutchman... a Welshman!  
  
  
As to the irrelevance that is Steinbeck:  

  
 I have been reading the discussion between you and Ken with great interest.  

 Both of you have argued your views with coherence\*.  
 . . .

  
  
 I am an Indian and can insightfully discuss the writings of Steinbeck.  

 I need not be California-born to appreciate Steinbeck ...  
  
  
  
  
\*coherence  
 The links among its *underlying* ideas  (anumāna)  
  
 He was of German, English, and Irish descent!  
  
cohesion  
 links among its *surface* elements  (pratyakṣa)  
  
  
as to your āgamāḥ - Patañjali does not venture to define the means evaluate an authority  
  
But Mahaguru Taff, courageously ventures to define thusly:  
  
good authority will readily cite the source of what is merely second-hand pramāṇāni  
 so that his source be subject to anumāna thus for his authority be rightly certified.  
  
And having duly subject Steinbeck to some anumāna, I discover that not only that he was first and foremost a *story* teller i.e. a writer of *fiction*.  
but also that he was of German, English, and Irish descent.  
  
  
Taff Rivers,  
  
 Passing water with the best of them.
