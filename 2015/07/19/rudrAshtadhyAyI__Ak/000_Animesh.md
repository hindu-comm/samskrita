SrI mAtre namaH ,

Namaste all,

In contrast with rUdraM of krishna yajurveda , shukla yajurveda have
rudrAshtadhyAyI .Literary rudrAshtadhyAyI means eight chapters dedicated to rUdra .Following post describes of rUdrAshtadhyAyI with audios ( mp3 format ) .  
I have posted maithila recitation style which is closest to original recitation style of shukla yajurveda , except small peculiarity due to maithila language and a pdf file of it in devnAgrI script.
