Namaskar!

  

I have recently begun to study Sanskrit, and it was a great joy to find that we would be learning the nAsadIya sUktam (Rigveda 10:129) as part of the Second Year, BA syllabus.

  

While I am trying to understand the short sUktam, I would be grateful if the learned members of this forum can suggest references for the same.

  

I read once the translation and brief commentary by Velankar, but I am not fully satisfied with it. Perhaps because Velankar Mahodaya makes references to Purush and Prakriti as part of explaining "Svadha" and "Abhu". Some of these concepts, including "Retah" are tough. A. L. Basham is good, but not detailed enough when it comes to explanation of these terms.

  

Looking forward to hearing from you,

My vandana to all.
