In many places it has been told that Valmiki who wrote Ramayanam in Sanskrit is from the same period as Rama. Ramayanam took place in Treta Yugam. The mostly used script for writing Sanskrit, Devanagari, has been adopted only in the 19th century.



Thus my question is, if Ramayana was originally been "written" by Valmiki which script did he use?



On the other hand, if Ramayanam has remained as an "oral" epic for a long time and only few centuries back it has been documented, whom did Valmiki "told" Ramayanam for the first time?
