The complete shloka is here:

श्रीकृष्ण कृष्णसख वृष्ण्यृषभावनिध्रुग्*राजन्यवंशदहनानपवर्गवीर्य*। गोविन्द गोद्विजसुरार्तिहरावतार योगेश्वराखिलगुरो भगवन्नमस्ते ॥४३ll

It seems difficult for correct ion without a commentary or original print. The above I have corrected few typo errors noted in the version available on the net. All the compounds are vocative singulars along with several non-compound words all vocatives and wrong splitting may result in wrong interpretations.
