Respected scholars,  

Recently I have modified one Artificial neural net code for identification of samAsas in Sanskrit language.  
<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SamaasaClassification> is the code location.  
  

The results are very encouraging.  

Without feeding any rule to the computer, the following is the classification result  
  

1\. Major 5 samAsa types classification - 70%  

2\. Minor 55 samAsa subtypes classification - 55 %.  

3\. Major 5 samAsa types classification taking the first two entries - 85 %.  
  

Probability of a fluke would be 1 - 20 %, 2 - 0.2 %, 40 %.  
  

So, the machine learning is statistically significant, if not good enough.  
  
  

The database which was used was scraped from <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/Corpus/SHMT/Samaas-Tagging/> and randomly shuffled to homogenize the dataset.  
  

The tool was developed for samAsa classification initially, but now generalized for any string classification problem.  
  

Hope the scholars would like the tool.
