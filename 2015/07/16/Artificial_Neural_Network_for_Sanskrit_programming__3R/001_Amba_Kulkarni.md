Dear Dhaval Patel,  
  

Thanks for sharing this.  
  

I have a question: Is the test data different from the training?  

  

I assume you have referred to the following two works:  

1.  [Statistical Constituency parser for Sanskrit
    compounds](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/samaasa_const_parser_icon2011.pdf)
    Amba Kulkarni and Anil Kumar, ICON 2011, Chennai Dec 18-19 2.  [Clues from Astadhyayi for compound
    identification](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/scti-5scls.pdf)
    Amba Kulkarni and Anil Kumar, 5th international SCLS 2013, Mumbai

The first one reports the performance of the system, using only simple probabilities.  
  

The performance figures for 56 tags were as follows:  
  

Rank With 55 tags With 8 tags  
1 63.0% 72.7%  
2 10.9% 13.2%  
3     7.2%         9.5%  
  

where Rank indicates the position of the correct solution among all possible solutions.  

  

The second one uses clues from the A.s.taadhyaayii to detect the compound type of rare compounds, and the performance was 61% times we got the first guess correct, and if we allow 3 guesses, 81% one among the 3 guesses were correct.  
  

With regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
