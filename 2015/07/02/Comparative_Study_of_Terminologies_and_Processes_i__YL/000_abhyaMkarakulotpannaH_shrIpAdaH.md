Glad to inform that some Comparative Study of Terminologies and Processes in Sanskrit and English Grammars is submitted here -->  
<https://grammarofsanskrit.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/comparative-study-of-grammatical-terminologies-and-processes-preface-and-paras-1-to-4/>  
  

This link is for the Preface and Paras 1 to 4. There are also four more compilations -  

1.  Parts 5, 6, 7 2.  Parts 8 and 9 3.  Alphabetical Index - English/Sanskrit 4.  Alphabetical Index - Sanskrit/English  

In the blog's menu, I have provided a 'Category' as "Study of Terminologies" from where the five parts can be individually accessed.  
  
All the Parts will be subject to updating as the study proceeds.  
  
I shall be obliged for critical comments.
