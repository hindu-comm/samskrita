A minor point - the Guru Granth Sahib is composed of hymns by the various Sikh Gurus. In addition to compositions by the Sikh gurus, the Granth also contains various Bhakti saints of the medieval period. The majority of the hymns, contrary to popular supposition, is in various dialects of Hindi i.e., Khari Boli, Braj Bhasha etc.  
  
The misconception that the Granth is in Punjabi comes possibly from two sources:  
  
1. Most Sikhs are Punjabi speaking.  
2. The Granth is written in Gurmukhi script. The same script is used for writing Punjabi.  
  
It may be puzzling as to why the hymns of the Granth are not in Punjabi. For this, it is sufficient to realize that the Gurus have to be seen as very much part of the saintly poetical tradition of the 15th to 17th century northern India. The carriers of this tradition mostly composed in dialects of Hindi such as Braj, Khari Boli (and Awadhi in the case of Kabir, Tulsidas) and some other dialects too.  
  
Recently a distinguished scholar and academic, the late Professor Sahib Singh, translated the entire Granth Sahib into Punjabi. That should tell us something.  
  
Hope this helps,
