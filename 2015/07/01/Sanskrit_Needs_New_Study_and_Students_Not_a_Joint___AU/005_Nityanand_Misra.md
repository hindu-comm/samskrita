The *Dasama Grantha* is predominantly in Braja Bhasha, not Punjabi. There are some sections in Persian (e.g. Zafarnama, Fatehnama, Hikayats) and some compositions in Punjabi, and there are words borrowed from Sanskrit, Awadhi, Arabic, etc. But mostly it is a Braj Bhasha work.

  

Even *Guru Grantha Sahib* is not entirely Punjabi, Sant Bhasha is equally prominent.
