Sanskrit needs more intense study (since 'new study' of all kinds including that of the author of the piece is already there. ) , more students (since students are already there) is a point anyone hardly disagree with.



But what is the problem of the author with the other aspects that he brings into discussion?



Is not Sanskrit *lingua indica* (in the sense of Indian language)? It iscertainly one of the *linguae indicae* at least as per the eighth schedule of the Indian constitution. If 'lingua indica' has been used in the sense of a link language, is there evidencein Sushmaji's speech to think that she wanted to make Sanskrit the language of day to day communicationto connectall the Indians with their different mother tongues? Does *lingua indica* mean the only language of India? Leave alone Sushmaji, can we imagine anyone conceiving such a project? 



The author says, "The language of the Vedas is Sanskrit, as it is of the Upanishads. But to call it the language of Vedanta is akin to calling Hebrew the language of Christianity or Pali the language of Buddhism, Arabic the language of Islam, Punjabi the language of Sikhism."



Leaving alone his ignorance about the fact that experts consider the language of the Vedas and Upanishads to be different from (or the older gloss than)(laukika) Sanskrit, yes, Hebrew is the language to which all Christians would turn to for the 'original' Christian ideas; Arabic is the language to which all Islamic people would turn to for the original ideas of Islam; Pali studies all over the world are motivated by the interest in Buddhism studies only.I would learn classical Greek if I would like to see the original ideas of Aristotle in poetics. In that sense, classical Greek is indeed the language of classical western philosophy. My respect for Greece and Greek are born out of my respect for the classical Greek literature and philosophy.



All the remaining Ashoka -Prakrita -Buddhism part of the piecebetrays the usual artificial schism created by a brand of academicians between Prakrit and Sanskrit ignoring the sociolinguistic continuities between them and ignoring the fact that Sanskrit studies are essentially packaged with Prakrit studies.This is based ona highly questionable idea of discontinuity and conflict between 'Hinduism' and Buddhism.
