What has been reproduced above does not look like Sanskrit. I am not very trustful of what passes off as Sanskrit in the Indian moviedom.

  

That said, out of curiosity, I had a look at the movie in [imdb.com](http://imdb.com) and also on youtube. It seems to be a big commercial success and is in the genre of mythological movies of the 1950s and 60s. It has not appeared on a trusted site like youtube as yet. What is available on youtube looks like promos. The language is not Hindi and there are no subtitles in English. This makes the movie out of reach for people like me.
