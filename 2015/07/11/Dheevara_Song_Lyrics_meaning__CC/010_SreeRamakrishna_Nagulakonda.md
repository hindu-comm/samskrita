Vasudeva! MR.Sri Ram, Very nice compilation/collection from the internet and well said.

  

There is no point in thinking whether it is correct Sanskrit or not.  

At first it is the lyrics composed in Telugu language for a Cienema and hence it is mostly with Cinema Music style.

and usually many Telugu poems one can find Sanskrit words. And heard that the Sanskrit words are first composed by Rajamouli's / Keeravani’s father.

  

ధీవరా! ప్రసర శౌర్య భార!

ఉత్సరా! స్థిర గంభీర!  

  

To be frank i can catch and understand few words and can connect to most of the words . But the song is very nice melody one, and I feel it is right song unlike most of the Indian cinema songs which are played during the story in the name of entertainment / fun. I started liking the song more after watching Bahumali Conclusion. I did not know much about Bahubali-1  

  

  

And another point with Hindi is, it another regional language and much younger than Telugu. There is no point expecting correct lyrics/sounds in Hindi unless one do not know Telugu or Sanskrit. Because Telugu is one of the best and better language than Hindi, if you notice the Tamil singers in T.Nagar's Tyagaraja sabha, still use Telugu script/Telugu Sankeertana composed by Swami Tyagaraja (=Tyagaiah) besides Tamil. Every language has got it's own beauty and Popularity.

And everybody in India knows Tamilians love and extreme love with Tamil language but coming to Taraja's Sakeeratanalu they stick to some of the Telug lyrics...may be due to specific features and beauty of Telugu.

  

Regards  

Ramakrishna
