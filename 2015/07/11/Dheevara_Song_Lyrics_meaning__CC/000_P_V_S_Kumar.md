Can someone help in understanding the meaning of the Sanskrit lyrics of one of the recently released movie song:



Song: Dheevara

 Movie: Baahubali (2015)





Dheevara **prasara shourya bhara**  
**Uthsara** sthira ghambheera  
…

Ugrama asama shourya bhaava  
Roudrama nava **bheethirma**  
…

Vijitharipuru dhiradhaara kalithara shikhara kathora  
Kulaku tharathilitha gumbheera jaya viraat veera

  
Vilayagaganathala bhikara garjjadhara gara  
Hrudhaya rasa kasara vijitha madhu paara paara

  

Bhayagaramshav vibhavasindhu  
Suparadhangam bharanarandhi

  



Dhanyavaadah

Kumar
