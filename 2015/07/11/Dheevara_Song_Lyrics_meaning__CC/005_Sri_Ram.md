Namaste,  
  
I found a translation in the internet.The following is the translation by Kumar Narasimha of the song Dheevara written by Shri Ramajogayya Sastri and K Shiv Shakti Datta. It exhibits the depth and beauty of Indic language poetry. This language is the reason why Indian people are so good at poetry and literature.  
  
1. Dhivara, prasara shourya bhaara  
The brave persevering one, your bravery is taking you forward.  
  
2. Uthsara, sthira gambheera  
The one who is leaping higher and higher, who is firm and stable and seriously determined  
  
3. Ugrama, asama shourya bhaava  
He is strong, and without an equal in the ability/mentality to fight  
  
4. Roudrama, nava bheetirma  
His anger will cause new fears (in his foes).  
  
5. Vijita ripu rudhira dhaara, kalitara shikhara kathora  
This is a complex expression seen only in Indic language poetry. The poet is stating that Shivudu is experiencing the intensity of climbing a tough peak, and likening it to the feeling in a hard battle, when you see your enemy defeated, and blood flowing like a rivulet. This is classical Veera rasa.  
  
6. Kulakutara kulita gambheera, jaya virat veera  
His rough body itself is like a sharp weapon (because he is determined to win). Hail this complete hero of the world.  
  
7. Vilaya gagana tala bheekara, gharjjhadvaara haraa  
The hero is destructive in the air/sky as well (because he can leap at an enemy from a great height). He can defeat the enemy (simply) with his fearsome roar of war.  
  
8. Hridaya rasa kaasaara, vijita madhu paara haara  
The poet is saying that he might have been a ferocious warrior (against the mountain) till now, but after his victory, he will become soft hearted.  
  
9. Bhayadaram shav, Vibhava Sindhu  
These final lines are a form of shanti mantra to calm down his excited warrior state of mind. Killer of fear (form of Shiva and Shakti together), Ocean of wealth  
  
10. Supara dhangam, bharana randhi  
Now content after reaching his goal (end of a tough journey), and that his battle is now over, troubles or injuries are going away.
