Some of the above meanings don't make sense to me with my partial Sanskrit knowledge. I differ in some points. I write it here because I think there are some beautiful comparisons and words in this sone.  
  
5. Vijita ripu rudhira dhaaraa kalita-asi-dhara (विजितरिपुरुधिरधाराकलित-असिधर)  
  
In Telugu version of the song, there is no 'khara' (in 'shikhara'). So I think this is close to the original sound and also has a proper meaning.  
  
Meaning: Holder of the sword stained with the blood of the defeated enemy  
  
6. Kathora kulakudhara tulita gambhiira (कठोरकुलकुधरतुलितगम्भीर)  
  
Meaning: As Gambhiira as a कुलकुधर (seven great mountains are called कुलकुधरs or कुलपर्वतs)  
  
7. Vilaya gaganatala bhiikara garjaddhaaraadhara (विलयगगनतलभीकरगर्जद्धाराधर)  
As fearsome as the sky during a vilaya and like a lighting cloud
