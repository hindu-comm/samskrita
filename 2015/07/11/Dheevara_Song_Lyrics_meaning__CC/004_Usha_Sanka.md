भ्रातः, नमस्ते

Happy that it helped to some extent.

If you can contact that lyricist, and get original lyrics which he had written, directly from him, then with the help of those distortion-free words, meaning can be much clear.

That's what- trying to fit the Samskrt words in the beat-based tune, with heavy accompaniment, along with purposefully bad pronunciation, -has made the words insensible.
