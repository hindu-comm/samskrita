Namaste Arvindji,

  

What you are writing makes sense - because as I browse through the text, I find that the ideology is same as the classical one - for example, the belief that Varna is decided by one's Guna and Karma - the same thing is said in almost identical way in Geeta (where Lord Krishna says that Four Varnas are craeted by me based on Guna and Karma). There are so many such similarities that one begins to believe that if the Guru of demons is saying these things, then Demons are Gods! I mean, even if we have only a broad idea that the demons were demons not because they lacked bravery, skill, intelligence, opulence or capabilities - just that much of it was 'misdirected' or not used in desirable manner. in fact, demons like Ravana were offsprings of sages. So, in a text on Neeti - policy guideline - one expects to find what core beliefs separate the demons from the Devas.

  

So far, I have not found it.

If you or anyone reading this have a list of sources of different versions of Shukraniti/sara, kindly point those to me.

  

Best regards,

Margie Parikh
