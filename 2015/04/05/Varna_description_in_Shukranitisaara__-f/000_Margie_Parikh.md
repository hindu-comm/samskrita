Namaste!

  

I came across the description of people in four Varnas by Shukracharya. It is fascinating that one would expect the Guru of demons to differ from the mainstream thought, but Shukracharya says the same thing as Lord Krishna did in Geeta! Both emphasize classification - Varna vyavastha - based on गुण and कर्म.

  

While the question remains as to how exactly the demons differed from the deva, I made a short quiz out of shlokas in the Shukranitisara - a link to it appears at the bottom of my Blog here:

I am wondering if eventually one can develop a full-fledged, psychometrically sound test out of it.

  

Have a great day!
