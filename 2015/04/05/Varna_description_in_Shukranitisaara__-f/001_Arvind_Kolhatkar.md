I am no scholar of शुक्रनीति or शुक्रनीतिसार or of several other texts that lay down rules by which the kings should conduct their affairs and common persons should carry on with their lives. Yet, I would say the following in answer to the question above.

  

Shukra, the reputed Guru of the Demons, is a mythological creation dating from the very ancient past and finding in him any real historical person is an impossible task. Texts likeशुक्रनीति or शुक्रनीतिसार, on the other hand, were created in much later times, most probably between the first to the tenth century of the present era. These have been written by a real though unknown person, who was a Brahmin law-giver like Manu, Narada etc. These works cover much the same ground as the works of these other lawgivers

  

Incidentally, several versions ofशुक्रनीतिसार may be extant. The one that I have - 1890 (?) Calcutta edition with a commentary byजीवानंद विद्यासागर does not contain your quoted verses, at least not at the mentioned numbers.
