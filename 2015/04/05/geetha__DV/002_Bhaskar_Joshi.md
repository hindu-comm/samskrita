Both pronunciations are correct. It is customary to use last vowel of the group in place of anuswar. So in case of  
क ख ग घ ड. as in मूकं करोति वाचालम्  
मूकं can be pronounced as मूकम् as well as मूकड्. as after कं the vowel is क in करोति and so on for  
च छ ज झ (i can't type the next on on iphone)  
ट ठ ड ढ it cud be म् or ण्  
त थ द ध it cud be म् or न्  
Hope with limitation of the phone keyboard i could illustrate it.
