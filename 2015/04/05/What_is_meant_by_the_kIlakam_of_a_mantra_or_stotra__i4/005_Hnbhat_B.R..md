Sorry. I was busy with some other work. I think the word कीलक is associated with two other types of mantra-s अर्गल and कवच all the three providing shelter or protection like shield to the reciter कवच. tadvinā saptaśatījapasya na phalajanakatvamiti gamyate“argala  
kīlakaṁ cādau paṭhitvā kacam paṭhet”tatraiva

कीलक ¦पु० कीलति बध्नात्यनेन करणे घञ् स्वार्थे क ।

The idea is providing the inner lock with bolt अर्गल and कीलक for tying the shield कवच firmly to the body.

Hope the idea is now clear. The कवच is worn firmly with buttons and button holes or inner lock and bolt. Hence the three related.
