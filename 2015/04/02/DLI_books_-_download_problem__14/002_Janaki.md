Dear Arvind_Kolhatkar Sri,  
(1) I got the threads about DLI and I am going through it.  
  
(2) I have download the book from [archive.org](http://archive.org) just now form the URL <https://archive.org/details/KAIVALYANAVANEETHAM> . but this book I already have download from DLD website. And also it contains 83 pages.  
You are right the this is full scanned book but I have another edition of this book which contains 276 Shlokas and this 83 pages book contains onle 20-25 Shlokas, So there should be 276 Shlokas. I know a some Tamil digits, so I wrote that this is partially scanned book.  
  
BTW, Thank you very much for this assistant. I am still searching solution to get this book.  
  
Thank you  
  
Janakisharan
