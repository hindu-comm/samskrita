Respected Scholars,  
The "<http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/>" provides most of rare and out of print books. It's great job. But problems come when somewhere links not working, books scanned partially not fully etc. Though there is an option of **feedback \| missing links or books \| problems**, but on this email id there is also no reply after one and half month.  
  
Actually, I found a book (Barcode 1990050050639) on DLI website and downloaded it. but it was partially scanned. In admin metadata section it shows that it was scanned at AKCE UNIVERSAL DIGITAL LIBRARY. (it may be ARULMIGU KALASALINGAM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, Madurai). I contact there but in vain.  
Particularly, I want only this books in any form (PDF/online/books). So I request scholars/technical experts to guide and show an appropriate way that how we can access missing or partially scanned books from DLI.  
  
I think many of us face this problem. If there is already an answer about it on BVP, request to provide the thread.  
  
Thank you
