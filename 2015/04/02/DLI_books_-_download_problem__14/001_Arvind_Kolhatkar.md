There have been several threads in this Group in the past about the DLI and its problems/solutions. For example, you can go [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/samskrita/DLI/samskrita/z1YkAzFqdSM/4UbJhf-IDpgJ).
You can see the others by entering 'DLI' in the search box above.

  

Using the barcode that you provided, I have been able to download the book. I do not read or understand Tamil. However, I went through what I have downloaded and it looks complete to me, all 83 pages - no half pages etc.

  

I have uploaded the book to [archive.org](http://archive.org) just today and this is the URL <https://archive.org/details/KAIVALYANAVANEETHAM> .
You can take it from there easily as it is a pdf file. Maybe you have to wait for a little while till its processing inside [archive.org](http://archive.org) is complete but give it a try right away.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
