Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As per Hindu Traditions all full moon days (Pournami) are very important from the religious point of view - as it is they day when manes (**Pitrus**) and **Devas** are worshipped - for example **Satyanarayana Puja**, **Devi Puja**, **Shiva Puja** are performed. In the South, **Chitra Pournami** is a very important occasion where **Lord Shiva** is worshipped along with **Chitragupta** who is the book-keeper of all our deeds and mis-deeds (to be benign when we pass off his mortal coil and go in front of him for the balance sheet of this life)

  

In that context, I happy to attach a beautiful hymn on **Lord Somanatha** (**Somnath** in **Gujarat**, known as **Prabhasa** in puranic times) takenfrom **Skanda Puranam, Prabhasa Khanda, Prabhasa/Nyankumati Mahatmya, Kubera Nagarotpatti and Chapter 290**. The hymn is easy to understand and essentially extols **Lord Somanatha** as the **Mula Prakriti**. I think the prayer is especially beautiful from the **Sharanagati** perspective - it beseeches **Lord Somanatha** to redeem the reciter from **Samsara** and its tribulations.

  

May We Seek The Blessing of **Lord Sadashiva** on this **Chitra Pournami** day!
