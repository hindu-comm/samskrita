I find Apte's work all the more remarkable because it appears to have been a one-man-effort and that too during a very short life. Another great work that we all use is the MW dictionary. (In my personal view the MW dictionary is superior to Apte's for the etymologies and the comparisons with other IE languages that MW provides.) As the long introduction of MW tells us, he was assisted by a number of able assistants. He was already a Professor, with contacts throughout the world of Sanskrit scholarship in Europe and India. He had the weight of his position and the weight of the mighty British Establishment behind him.

  

Apte, on the other hand was a young person, just out the University, with no position of any kind behind him. the traditional Pandits would not have been able to help much in a work of this type and he had nothing that would induce them to help him. There were no modern libraries around the corner to supply him with books and references. He had only his own knowledge, memory and resources to fall back upon. Yet he succeeded so remarkably well in something that Kalidasa would describe asतितीर्षुर्दुस्तरं मोहादुडुपेनास्मि सागरम्, attempting to cross the ocean in a small rowing boat.
