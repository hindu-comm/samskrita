How the order of the days of the week is created has been made clear in this and the earlier discussions. What is missing is the fact that this order is a remnant of the beliefs of the olden days when the universe was arranged in the geocentric way. The earth was believed to be at the center and all heavenly bodies - the stars (all taken together asनभोमण्डल), followed by ग्रहs were ordered by theirapparent periods of revolving around the Earth . This order wasSaturn (248 years), Jupiter (11.86 years), Mars (687 days), the sun (365 days), Venus (225 days), Mercury (88 days) and theMoon (29 days). The ग्रहswere believed to hang in the sky in thatorder one below the other. The Sun was treated like otherग्रहs and so was the Moon. Saturn, the slowest, was actually calledमन्द.
