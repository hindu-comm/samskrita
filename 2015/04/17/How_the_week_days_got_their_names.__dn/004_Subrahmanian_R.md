Sir,

  

Nice reasoning for the sequence of the days of the week.

  

However,Sanivar, Ravivar etc are Hindi names and not of Sanskrit.

In Sanskrit the ‘vasara’ is used to represent the day of the week and the seven days are Indu vasaram, Bhaumavasaram, Saumya vasaram, Guruvasaram, Bhriguvasaram, Sthiravasaram and Bhanuvasaram.



In the Words Saturday, Sunday and Monday they do represent the three ‘planets’ Saturn, Sun and Moon. But Tues, Wednes, Thurs or Fri do not represent directly any planet or heavenly body.

  

Regards
