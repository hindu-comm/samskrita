All names are of the planets even in names like Tuesday, Wednesday etc.
They are derived from Old English/Middle English names that correspond to the Latin names of planets. For this please see <http://www.crowl.org/lawrence/time/days.html>

  

Shankar Balkrishna Dixit, in his authoritative book 'भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास' (History of Hindu Astronomy)(1897) brings out that in Hindu astronomical works the periods of revolutions of planets are always shown in the order of Sun, Moon, Mars etc and not in the more natural ascending or descending order from Saturn to Moon and this indicates that the concept of week days and knowledge of their rotation periods came into India from outside. (p.396)
