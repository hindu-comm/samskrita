Ken,

Have you come acrossthis web sitethat providesthe*Chandas* font?

There, you will also find a clickable keyboard layout (IME) that you can download.

  

Then it'sfingersand mousing, I don't think it enablesdrag 'n' drop etc.

  

But make sure that anyone reading your work, has the font, It is not native to theO/S's.

  

Cheers,
