Sir; 

  

Thank you most kindly.  This post of yours is of great use to me. I am inivolved in a project which involves Mudras and Aksharaabhyaasa. The project is an attempt to create, recreate, and /or adapt the existing mudras (hand gestures using fingers, palms and the back of the hands; and facial gestures) to be used for dual (hopefully later on for multiple) purposes of therapy (physical, mental, spiritual) and learning of Indian alphabets in such a way that any and all languages can use this mudras-alphabetical-system. 

This system of hasta-kala-mudraaksharaas for alphabets (in mudraas) is also accompanied by a system of written sysmbols using only three geometrical shapes (circles, triangles, squares-- full or partial shapes, and combinations) designated as roopa-kala-rekhaaksharaas for alphabets in written form or"lipi" or script.

Since fingers and straight and curved lines are ubiquitous and universally availabe and accessible, we hope both the Mudraaksharaas and Rekahaaksharaas could be "universally" useful and will be utilized as device for unifying scrpit for Indian laguages.

Fortunately most recently,Samskrit Bharathi and some temples have shown some interest in this development. 

I hope and pray that this google-group of formidable and generous people will help.

  

Thank you again,

  

Iyengar

  

P.S. I will post first instalment as soon as I get some technical help in scanning graphics and large files.
