Ken,



There seems to be a problem with languages and terminology.





Which link? “Based on this link...”

 What does Argentina (or Moscow conferences, for that matter) got to do with ancient sanscrit?



As to ‘modern, are you trying to compare classical Sanscrit with Gujanagari. They are different scripts.



By ‘lines’ do you mean strokes. Lines, as in your ‘lines above’, are generally understood to be the macron diacritic, used in connection with the Romanised Latin transliterations.



 Regards.
