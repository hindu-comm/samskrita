Manish,

"So I am still looking for a universally applicable solution."

For this forum, the native Georgia font has diacritics, including anglicised capitals.

Georgia is native to Windows, and will be available locally to the viewer.



Otherwise you could take a look at*Chandas* from

<http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/>

It is designed especially for Vedic and Classical Sanskrit.

But add a note within the text (using plain Latin characters!), that best results are obtained when viewed with said font.

Bearing in mind that your carefully crafted communication will not look very pretty to Chandas deficient forum members in general.
