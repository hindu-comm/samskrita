Manish,

  

 Be careful here.

  

The persons that receives e-mails musthavesuitablefonts available locally at his end. Otherwise the contentwon't render correctly.

  

For example, this Forum:
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita>itself only supports six fonts,natively.

(To see them, click on 'Normal' on the Menu Barwhen in Post mode):



 Normal (Arial)

 Normal/serif (Arial MT)

 Courier New

 Georgia

 Trebuchet

 Verdana

Should the person who posts the e-mail, do so via a copy & paste at his end, where hehas hisown fonts, all will look good to him.

The forumautomatically forwardse-mails, no matter how or wherecreated.

The person(s) viewing the e-mail, whether in a forum oroffline in a mailer, will need suitable fonts at his/her end, especially so, when wanting to seeVedic accents and such like.

  

That Tahoma font you mention, is indeed plain, but assan serif, it is meant to be.
