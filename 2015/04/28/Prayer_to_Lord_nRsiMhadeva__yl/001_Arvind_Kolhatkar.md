I suppose you are aware that this verse is from Sarga 1 of Jayadeva's Geetagovinda, where Jayadeva is praising the ten Avatara's of Vishnu, one of which is the Narasimha Avatara.

  

My translation, as close to the original as possible, is

  

तव करकमलवरे नखमद्भुतशृङ्गं

दलितहिरण्यकशिपुतनुभृङ्गम्।

केशव! धृतनरहरिरूप जय जगदीश हरे ॥४॥

O Keshava, your lotus-hands have pointed nails with which you rent asunder Hiranyakshipu's body like a bee. Be victorious O Hari, the Master of the Universe. who has assumed the appearance of a Man-Lion.

  

करकमल 'lotus-like hand' is a standard description of the hand of a god, a revered person, a beautiful damsel etc. करकमलवर means the 'best of the करकमल'. The word वर does not add much to the meaning but perhaps answers to the requirement of the meter in which the verse is composed.  

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
