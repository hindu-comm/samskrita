It is simple. The word आरण्यक is used in neuter gender, when referring  
to the portion of आरण्यक portion of Veda-s. and in compound also it  
retains, the same gender, as तत्पुरुष compound. तैत्तिरीयमारण्यकं  
तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम्, बृहदारण्यकम्, etc. belong to the same catagory. And  
उपनिषत् is always in feminine gender, and the same rule applies, when  
compounded with बृहदारण्यक, as तत्पुरुष, compound, it retains the  
feminine gender.  
  
It is a common practice, many words have fixed genders and many are  
used in two genders and some are used in three genders too,  
irrespective of the sex in human beings. Many others take genders by  
their grammatical derivation itself, like those like उपनिषत्.  
  
सर्वोपनिषदो गावो दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः।  
पार्थो वत्सः सुधीर्भोक्ता दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत्॥ ४ ॥  
  
And मैत्रायणी उपनिषत्, etc. take the gender by their derivation.  
मैत्रायणी, propounded by मैत्रेयी, or the like. And not because  
उपनिषत् is feminine gender.
