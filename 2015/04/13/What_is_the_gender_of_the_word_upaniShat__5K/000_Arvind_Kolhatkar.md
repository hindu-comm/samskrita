Dear Group,

  

Following the practice in Marathi, Hindi (and perhaps in other Indian languages too) I had so far been under the impression that the word
'उपनिषत्’ has the neutral gender in Sanskrit too. However, upon checking with both MW and Apte, it is seen that both of them show the word to have the feminine gender. The word 'बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत्' is shown as of the feminine gender.

  

At the same time, Apte also quotes in his entry on this word certain verses in which the gender appears to be neutral (ऐतरेयं च छान्दोग्यं बृहदारण्यकं तथा।)

  

How is this explained?
