Shaale in association with Karnataka Samskrit University presents the live webcast of the Workshop on Indian Logic and Epistemology (Tarkasaṁgraha) by Prof. V N Jha (Former Director, Centre for Advanced Studies in Sanskrit, Pune)

Tarkasaṁgraha of Annaṁbhaṭṭa is the fundamental text of the classical Indian intellectual, analytical and philosophical traditions. On one hand it presents linguistic modeling of the Universe and on the other hand it imparts training in cognitive analysis, research methodology, logic and epistemology.
