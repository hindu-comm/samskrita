It would appear that *Udyojak* is a Mararthi Magazine for entrepeneurs!  
Who would be those that make *continuous endeavours.*  
  
Hence  
   One who makes *continuous endeavour* which is the *third* sense:  

  
   • an arranger, preparer, contriver, effecter (cf. yuddha-y°).  
  
  
yojaka  
   • m. a yoker, harnesser, MBh. BhP.  
   • a user, employer, Kāv.  
   • an arranger, preparer, contriver, effecter (cf. yuddha-y°).  
   • N. of Agni (as the nuptial fire), Gṛhyās. \[858,1\]  
  

As to 'employer' which is not in context, but since you query such. It is indeed to be found gainfully employed in Sanskrt, according to the great Sir Monier Monier-Willaims it occurs in the *Kāvya* literature (don't ask me where!)  
  
 here in the out of context *fourth* sense we have:  
  
  • a user, employer, *Kāv*.  
  
  
Anyway, whereas I understand the good professor's derivation of the noun *udyojakaḥ* *उद्योजकः * from its root verb:  
  
 उद्योजयति इति उद्योजकः (udyojayati iti udyojakaḥ) one who employs, employer.  
  
  
I can't locate such a word in the lexicon itself.  
  
  
May the light shine onto all our endeavours.
