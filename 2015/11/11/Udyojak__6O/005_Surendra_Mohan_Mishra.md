namaamsi vidushaam !  
  
thanks taff for quoting sources.  
  
sometimes words and expressions seem to get old, tired and rare, and  
slowly they go out of circulation, we put them to the archaic box for  
an exercise by a grammarian, etymologist or lexicographer. if m m  
williams puts it up as found in some kaavya, it ought to be so, but in  
any case we have to attest this by evidence.  
  
on basis of what we avail of in vogue: 'udyoga', 'yojakah' etc., we  
can make use of such a word with a little risk. but to bring back such  
expressions in to circulation again, the prolific poets, writers and  
speakers (all of them aapta) could be instrumental. like dhaatu-s  
upasarga-s are also subject to different layers of meaning.  
  
let me write a sentence:  
udyogaah sulabhaa loke udyoktaaro na durlabhaah /  
udyojakaa hanta tu te matimantah sudurlabhaah //  
  
my understanding is as under:  
udbhuuya yunkte yah kaarye sa udyokteti kathyate /  
tasya yojayitaa tatrodyojakah suutradhaarakah //  
  
every time we use a word we may not have an exact precedence. words  
and senses both can be reinvented to convey our intention. after all  
the ultimate statement in semantics is 'sati taatparye sarve  
sarvaarthavaacakaah' !  
  
regards,  
smmishra
