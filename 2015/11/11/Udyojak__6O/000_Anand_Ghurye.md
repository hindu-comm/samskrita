Dear Friends ,

  

Is this a sanskrit word ? Udyog is given in Monier Williams as 

  

\[p= 191,1\] \[L=33481\] m. the act of undertaking anything , exertion , perseverance , strenuous and continuous endeavour

\[L=33482\] active preparation Ya1jn5. Katha1s. Hit. &c

  

So the one who does Udyog will be Udyogi . How is the word Udyojak formed ?

  

Thanks in advance.

  
  
  
Regards ,
