Regardless of whether the wordउद्योजक used in Hindi/Marathi/other vernaculars to mean 'an entrepreneur' has aproperSanskrit pedigree or not, it is a very apt word to describe what it attempts to describe.
This is exactly what the framers of the Indian Constitution had in mind when they wrote Article 351 in the Constitution. This article reads:

  

351\. It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.
