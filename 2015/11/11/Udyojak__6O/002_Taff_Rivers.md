Anand,  
  
 In the particular scheme of Roman transliteration, employed by the MW, your 'Udyog' occurs as udyoga.  
 Anyway, in all such Romanisations, the inherent short Devanagari vowel 'a', is always expressed.  
  
Thus in the MW:  
  
ud-yoga  
 • m. the act of undertaking anything, exertion, perseverance, strenuous and continuous endeavour.  
 • active preparation, Yājñ. Kathas. Hit. &c. \[191,1\]  
  
 For continuous endeavour *of the general kind t*here is the adjective:  
  
udyogin  
 • mfn. one who makes effort, active, laborious, persevering, energetic. \[191,1\]  
  
  
 There is no Udyojak:  
  
yojaka  
 • m. a yoker, harnesser, MBh. BhP.  
 • a user, employer, Kāv.  
 • an arranger, preparer, contriver, effecter (cf. yuddha-y°).  
 • N. of Agni (as the nuptial fire), Gṛhyās. \[858,1\]  
  
  
 As for continuous endeavour *of the particular kind (yoga?)* that's a different category of word sense.  
 Then there's the poetic senses...
