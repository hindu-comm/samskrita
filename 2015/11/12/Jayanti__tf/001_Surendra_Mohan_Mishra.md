namaamsi !  
  
the word 'jayantii' seems to be an adjective, but it's used in the  
given sense as a noun denoting mostly a birth anniversary.the genesis  
of this should be known.those who fast traditionally do it so on 24  
ekaadas'ii-s and 06 jayantii-s and on a few other occasions in the  
smaarta-pauraanika way.this is chiefly attached to the vishnu's  
incarnations: all 09 excepting kalki,sometimes krishna replaced by  
balaraama.but now so many jayantii-s are observed including those of  
men and women of great contribution in recent past.  
  
now in kurukshetra we shall be having kurukshetra utsava-giitaa  
jayantii samaaroha during 17-21 december.the bhaagavata saying 'jayati  
te'dhikam janmanaa vrajah' may be a point of reference where the word  
'jayantii' seems to have shaped gradually in to this form as we find  
it now.  
  
scholars may explore whether 'jayantii' as a birth anniversary or any  
festive occasion as such does have a vaishnava beginning ?

smmishra
