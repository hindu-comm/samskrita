thanks for quoting madhvaacaarya's jayantii-nirnaya. it clearly shows that jayantii is an adjective to kaalaashtamii. later 'jayantii' could have become a noun and gradually denote birth of great souls irrespective of the date thereof.. i suppose in nirnayasindhu etc 'jayantii' in this sense is there. this particular semantic expansion of the word has a vaishnavite origin as it seems. regards.
