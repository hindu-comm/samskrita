Respected Scholars,



I observe that in the South, especially Tamil Nadu, thesuffix Jayanti is used to denote a festival, particularly a religious festival as in Sankara Jayanti, Hanumat Jayanti, Krishna Jayanti etc.I am eager to know if the word Jayanti used in this sense in Sanskrit or in other parts of India also.



With respects

R Subrahmanian
