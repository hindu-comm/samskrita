Sri Abhyankar Mahodaya, When required to write my name in devanagari, I write it as सुब्रह्मणियन्. Different people would use different spelling just as a word in Indian language is spelt differently in the Roman Script and vice versa.

Sri Murthy Mahodaya, your replies satisfies my curiosity. I understand from your reply that the word Jayanti, IS used in Sanskrit; has been used as early as 13th Century; and by no less a scholar than Vedantadesika; used in the sense of birth-celebration. Thank you sir.

Respectfully

R Subrahmanian
