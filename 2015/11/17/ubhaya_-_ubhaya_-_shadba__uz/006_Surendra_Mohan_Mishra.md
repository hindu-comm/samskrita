suprabhaatam !

  

v s apte in his dictionary notes that 'ubhaya' could be in dual also acc. to some grammarians. he doesn't quote the name and also doesn't exemplify such use. he is silent on how 'ubhaya' is used in plural !

  

m\. williams mentions haradatta as accepting 'ubhaya' in dual.

  

we get 'ubhau' and 'ubhe' in use, so no question of identicality in the declension as it appears.

  

regards.
