I had a look at Entry No 100 which reads "आकारान्त: पुलिङ्ग: ’उभय’ शब्द: (Both), अस्य द्विवचनं नास्ति". This seems to be a typographical error.
Later, in Entry 102, it correctly says"अकारान्त: नपुसकलिङ्ग: ’उभय’ शब्द:"

  

I found this book, about which I was so far unaware, to be an excellent quick reference guide to words and their conjugations, especially useful to someone like me who is not a professional Sanskritist and who has forgotten most of the more complex Sanskrit grammar that was learnt in the school/college.
