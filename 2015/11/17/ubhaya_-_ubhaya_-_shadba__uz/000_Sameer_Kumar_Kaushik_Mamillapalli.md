Namaste,

  

I am referring to this shadba manjari :<http://www.scribd.com/doc/6591892/Sabda-Manjari>

where it says ubhaya(उभय ) shadba in pulinga is aakaaranta (आकारान्त )

Is this correct or incorrect?

  

Recently I was corrected by a sanskrit teacher that this is incorrect and I was pointed to rule 217 of Siddhanta Kaumudi.

  

Can someone please elaborate?

  

Regards,

Kaushik
