The stotra that you have attached in full of textual and grammatical mistakes.

  

Since you have taken the trouble to locate it, I presume that you have some acquaintance with the Sanskrit Bhakti tradition. In that case, understanding the meaning of the stotra should not be very difficult.
Being a 'Sahasranama stotra' it is just a compilation of names and attributes. I suggest that you take some trouble yourself to understand it with the assistance of a dictionary, before outsourcing that task to others. If a particular word presents you with any difficulty, you may come back for a clarification of it.

  

I doubt if anyone here will have the patience to present to you a full translation on a platter!

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
