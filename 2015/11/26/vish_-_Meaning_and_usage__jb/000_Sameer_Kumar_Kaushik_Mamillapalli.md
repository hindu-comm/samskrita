Namaste,

  

I would like to know how to useशकारन्त पुलिङ्गविश् shadba (विट् 
विशौ  विशः )

In one Shabda Manjari, it says it means "People".

I didnt find this meaning in my dictionary. Can anyone please throw some light on that?

Also , please can some one put this into sentence.

  

Thanks,

Kaushik
