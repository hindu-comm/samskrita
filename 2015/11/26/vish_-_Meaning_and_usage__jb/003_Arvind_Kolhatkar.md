The word 'विश्' (N) is shown by MW as deriving from the root 'विश्' (6P, to enter, settle down etc.) 'विश्' (N f) has the meaning of 'homestead, settlement, dwelling place' etc. Other words such asवेश्या, वैश्य also derive from the same root. Amarakosha has the following:ऊरव्या ऊरुजा अर्या वैश्या भूनिस्पृशो विश: (२.९.१) for persons of the Vaishya caste.
