Dear Sri. Daval ji,

  

Thanks for this valuable excel file. I could locate certain MSS searching in this file - it is indeed very useful, else such a search would've taken days if not weeks to do.

  

I have one query - what is the meaning of Digitized MSS here, is the MSS available in a Scanned format or anything like that ??

  

Kindly clarify. Also your experience in dealing with NAMAMI - do they send the scanned copies through Email or CD etc. ??

  

  

Regards

CG Krishnamurthi
