Dr. Fitzedward Hall (March 21, 1825 - February 1, 1901) was an American Orientalist, and philologist. He was the first American to edit a Sanskrit text, and was an early collaborator in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) project as the wikipage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzedward_Hall> tells us.

  

Though the Wikipedia entry does not say so, I have read it in Dr Buhler's Introduction to his विक्रमाङ्कदेवचरित that one of Hall's enduring contribution to the study of Sanskrit Literature is that he brought to light बाणभट्ट's हर्षचरित, a prose biography of Emperor Harshawardhan of Kanauj, the Indian Emperor of North India who lived in the 7th c.

  

He also had a remarkable career as a colonial in India in the mid-19th century, though it culminated unhappily for him. The following extract from 'Founding Grammars: How Early America's War Over Words Shaped Today's Language' by Rosemarie Ostler, pp 192-193' tells that part of his story.

  

\<\<Fitzedward Hall arrived at philology by an adventurous route.

  

Hall was born in Troy, New York, in 1825, the oldest of six children. As the son of a prosperous lawyer, he received a conventional education. Although the origins of English words always intrigued him, he concentrated on studying mathematics and science, earning a civil engineering degree at the age of seventeen. Four years later he enrolled at Harvard for further education, but before he could begin classes, his younger brother threw the family into an uproar by running away to sea. As the oldest child, twenty-one-year-old Fitzedward was delegated to go after him. He sailed from Boston in the spring of 1846, bound for Kolkata.

  

Hall's ship wrecked as it sailed into the mouth of the Ganges River, an accident that changed the course of his life. As he was now stranded in Kolkata for the near future, he decided to fill in time by learning Hindustani and Persian (a common second language in nineteenth-century India). He later added lessons in Bengali and Sanskrit. Hall never found his brother, but he did discover a passion for language studies.

  

Hall stayed in India for over ten years. While there, he married an Englishwoman living in Delhi, taught Sanskrit and English at Government College in Benares, became an inspector of public instruction for the colonial British government, and fought alongside the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

  

All the time, he continued to perfect his knowledge of Sanskrit. He was the first American to edit a Sanskrit text. He also learned as much as he could about philology and the history of English. When Hall finally left India, he did not return home to the United States, but settled with his family in London. For a while, his life assumed a more conventional shape. He held a professorship of Sanskrit, Hindustani, and Indian jurisprudence at King's College, as well as the post of librarian at the India Office, which oversaw British Indian affairs. Then in 1869 events took another strange turn.

  

Hall was dismissed from his post of India Office librarian and ejected from the London Philological Society after a controversy concerning the loan of valuable manuscripts in his charge. The details of the scandal are murky. Long after the events, Hall described his firing to an acquaintance by saying that the India Office had wrongly accused him of being a hopeless drunkard and a foreign spy. The public record from the time consists mainly of a series of elliptical letters in the Atheneaum from Hall and others, hinting at devious maneuvers and subtle counterploys.

  

After it was all over, Hall escaped to the Suffolk village of Marlesford. A few years later, his marriage broke up. He stayed on in Marlesford alone, resentful and increasingly reclusive. \>\>
