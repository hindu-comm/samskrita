Mukesh,  
  
 iTranslator 2003, works OK on my Windows 10 Pro setup, and its not even run in Compatibility mode.  
  
Did you do re-install?  
  
BTW  
 Do you know that iTranslator 2003 beta, which dispite its name, is actually a newer version of iTranslator 2003.  
It adds the ability to read/edit Unicode Devanagari and Convert to Roman transliteration or ITRANS, not to mention Roman transliteration to ITRANS.  
  
Comes with an onscreen character picker, switchable between Devanagari and Roman diacritics.  
  
Available to download from <http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/i2003beta.htm>, which also the details of its capabilities.  
  
I helped with the testing of it - its good, I still use it  
  
  
Taff,
