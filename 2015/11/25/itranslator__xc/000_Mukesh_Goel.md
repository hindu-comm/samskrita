Hi All,

  

I recently downloaded Windows 10 and my iTranslator 2003 software, which was working fine for Windows 8, is not working on Windows 10. Does anybody have a suggestion on what to do. Is there alternate software/tool, which can generate both devanagari and transliteration together?

  

Thanks
