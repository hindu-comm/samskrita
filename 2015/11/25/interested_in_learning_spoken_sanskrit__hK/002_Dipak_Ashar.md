Respected Sir, Madam,

  

1 - I will be interested in spoken Sanskrit. However, I am presently at Dubai. Is it possible to do it through e mails and exchange of voice messages or one has to be in same city. Please let me know

  

2 - I have collection of 200 + Shubhashitas and shlokas from our group, or received from friends and respected elders / scholars.

  

These contain the ones from upanishad, chanakya neeti, Bhagvad Geeta, Vedas etc.

  

I have attempted to work on them, selected few, broken them down word by word, and translated in English, to popularise to youngsters of today, the common men who should be again made aware of the basic rules of life , taught by our ancestors and which are perpetually true even in future.

  

One of the organisers of one community have shown interest in publishing it in their monthly magazine / newsletter for the benefit of their members especially youngsters.

  

I need like minded people to share, collaborate with me and exchange views and ideas it for a good cause.

  

Need comments and suggestions for improvement from our respected learned scholars and seniors or any of the members. 

  

3 - If any of the members in this group are in Dubai, I request them to revert , in order to take the matter further , through personal meetings and exchange of ideas. on my personal e mail [asha...@gmail.com]()

  

regards

  

Dipak Ashar
