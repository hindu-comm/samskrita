Dear all,

I am looking for a baraha IME like app for my recently acquired Android phone. When I googled, several options popped up. I would like to know from experienced users from this group which would work best. Android version is Lollipop, specifically Motog. Transliteration scheme should be like Baraha/Itrans.

Thanks for guidance,

Regards,

Murthy
