Seems like bhagavaan heard your prayers. The new Google Indic keyboard has the desired functionality. i am going strictly by the description given (copied below) in the playstore and haven't tried it yet:

Google Indic Keyboard supports different modes of input:

\- Transliteration mode - Get output in your native language by spelling out the pronunciation using English letters (For example, “namaste“ -> “नमस्ते“.)

\- Native keyboard mode - Type directly in native script.

\- Handwriting mode (currently available for Hindi only) - Write directly on your phone screen.

\- Hinglish mode - If you choose “Hindi” as an input language, the English keyboard will suggest both English and Hinglish terms.
