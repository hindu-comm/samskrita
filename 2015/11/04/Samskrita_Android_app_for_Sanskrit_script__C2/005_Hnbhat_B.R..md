 You can try Indic key board which can be enable keyboards for different Indian languages and could be used by input language options easily. It can be enabled by input methods compact, inscript, and by google transliteration also which is convenient.

In all languages you have both ङ ञ letters.

You can use Google Keyboard also. But there is no option for Sanskrit apart from हिन्दी but there is no ङ in the keyboard display, but you can get it by pressing न only which gives the option for ङ also with which one can manage Sanskrit typing like गङ्गा, पञ्च etc.
