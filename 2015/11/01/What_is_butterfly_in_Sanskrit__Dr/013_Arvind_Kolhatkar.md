A reader who chanced upon this thread and who studies butterflies informs me that the Prakrit word for 'butterfly' isभंबिरी. This looks quite similar to Sanskrit भ्रमर. If so, I wonder which word has arisen from which. The reader also says that this explains the Marathi proverb 'भंबेरी उडणे' - the flying ofभंबेरी - that describes a situation of total confusion.
