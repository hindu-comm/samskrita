Following up on that MW ref. to BhP.  
  
I find a caterpillar and an assumed butterfly  
  
Bhāgavata-purāṇa  
  
Conto 4b  
  
Chapter 29: The Conversation of Nârada and King Prâcînabarhi  
  
(76-77)    Just like a caterpillar does not disappear when it has to forsake its body \[to become a butterfly\],  
a materially identified man does not vanish upon the termination of his karmic existence, for the mind \[transported by the linga\] is the ruler of man, it is the cause of the material existence of all the embodiments created  
  
I can't find a Sanskrit rendition of same, online.  
  
  
The transcendental experience, comes from pra-ṇava, when that 'karmic existence' of the mind, is 'terminated' temporarily, by that mind.  
  
It is a foretaste of what's to come, for when the temporary becomes the permanent.  
  
There's always a last time!  
  
Until then we can carry on admiring the butterflies.
