Dear Group,

  

I have been trying to find out the Sanskrit equivalent for the ubiquitous 'butterfly'.

  

Sanskrit literature has thousands of references to भृङ्ग, मक्षिका, मधुमक्षिका and their synonyms but I do not recollect any in them about the butterfly in my admittedly limited reading. This surprises me because the butterfly is present everywhere in nature and easily attracts attention because of its varieties and beauty. There does not seem to be any Sanskrit word that means 'the butterfly', although Sanskrit poets took delight in describing the nature around them in every detail.

  

Apte's English-Sanskrit dictionary lists 'चित्रपतङ्ग' as the translation of 'butterfly' but Apte has not given any source for it.
Monier-Williams does not show 'चित्रपतङ्ग' at all. Amarakosha in 2.5.27-28 and in 3.3.20 lists several words about various flying insects but Ksheeraswaami does not say anything that can identify any of those words with 'butterfly'. From this I suspect that चित्रपतङ्ग would be a 'manufactured' word and not a natural word used in classical Sanskrit.

  

I request scholars here to clarify the situation and supply a word for 'butterfly' with examples of its use from Sanskrit literature.

  

I understand that the word for 'butterfly' in the Bengali language is प्रजापति. How did प्रजापति come to mean 'butterfly' in Bengali?शब्दकल्पद्रुम, the thesaurus prepared in Bengal and published in the Chaukhamba Sanskrit Series, does not show any connection between प्रजापति and the butterfly.
