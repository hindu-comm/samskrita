I tracked down the earlier thread on this topic. It is [seen here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/samskrita/Butterfly/samskrita/cqjyhADucMk/hRYWzEC9JmMJ).  
  
That still leaves my question unanswered. MW shows पतङ्ग and पतङ्गम underपत as meaning 'a butterfly' but it is not an exclusive meaning.
These words have several other meaning,s including even the sun. I am surprised that something as attention-grabbing as the butterfly should not attract the attention of Sanskrit poets, many of whom were prolific describers of the nature around them and that the butterfly should not have a Sanskrit word clearly pointing to the butterfly!
