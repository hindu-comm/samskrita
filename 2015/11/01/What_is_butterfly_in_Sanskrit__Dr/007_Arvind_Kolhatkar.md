Venetia,

  

I do not think that there were no butterflies in India till very recent times - say a couple of thousand years. India is not a land-mass unconnected with the rest of the world and separated by thousands of miles of ocean. It is very much a part of the Asia and its flora and fauna must have been fixed millions of years ago.
