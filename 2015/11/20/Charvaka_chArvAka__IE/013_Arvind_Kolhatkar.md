I quickly went through the 'Barhaspatya sutra' edited by FW Thomas, referred to above. I did not find anything that would make it the standard text of Lokayata, It is a strait-forward list of advisory aphorisms for the guidance of the kings. At some of the places, for example in Ch 2, the Lokayatikas are spoken of with derision and disdain.

  

Just as there are several Canakyas whose sutras are available, not all of them traceable to the author of Arthashastra, so also there are perhaps multiple Brihaspatis under that umbrella name.
