As to the book 'Barhaspatya sutra'that came out in 1921, translated and edited by FW Thomas, Debiprasad Chattopaadhyaya, in his 'Loayata - A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism' has made the following observation on p.8:

  

"It is true that FW Thomas recovered a certain *Brihaspati Sutra* which, as edited and translated by him, was published in 1921. It could be a Lokayata work because Brihaspati is said to have been the founder of the school. However, no scholar could take this text seriously. It was a very late product often dominated by an ideology really alien, or even positively hostile, to the Lokayata-views." (p. 8)
