Ken, 

  

I write this from my general knowledge without claiming any authority over it.

  

चार्वाकदर्शन or लोकायतदर्शन was the Materialistic School in Indian Philosophy. It did not subscribe to the standard doctrines such as the Vedas being 'inspired' (अपौरुषेय) or the immortality of the soul (आत्मन्) etc. One whole chapter in the celebratedसर्वदर्शनसंग्रह of विद्यारण्यस्वामी (15th c., a summery of all major schools of Indian Philosophy) is devoted toचार्वाकदर्शन or लोकायतदर्शन. The following two popular verses that summarize the teachings of this School also appear in सर्वदर्शनसंग्रह.

  

यावज्जीवेत्सुखं जीवेन्नास्ति मृत्योरगोचरः।

भस्मीभूतस्य देहस्य पुनरागमनं कुतः॥

  

यावज्जीवेत्सुखं जीवेदृणं कृत्वा घृतं पिबेत्।

भस्मीभूतस्य देहस्य पुनरागमनं कुत:॥

  

With the decline of Brahminism in modern India and the balancing rise of more materialistic schools such as Marxism and Socialism, चार्वाकदर्शन is also receiving a good amount of attention. Several books in regional languages have appeared on it in the recent years.  

  

If you enter the search terms चार्वाकदर्शन or लोकायतदर्शन in Google Books (Free view), you will get several hits. Perusal of them may supply you with what you want to know.
