Dear Sri Dipak Ashar,

  

I came across a book on Charvaka in Hindi - some Sanskrit text and Hindi notes. Some of that I noted - partly in English and partly in Hindi (when I found it difficult to convert to English). The sandhi vichhedh is for my convenience - words split - two vowels close by and not coalescing etc. I have now typed out the entire thing using Baraha. There are bound to be other typing mistakes also. Do bear with me.

  

It is not the entire book. Whatever attracted me or interested me at that time, I have copied.

  

With respects

R Subrahmanian
