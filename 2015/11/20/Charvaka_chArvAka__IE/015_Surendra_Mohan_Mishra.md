yes, this is why the late prof. anantalal thakur wrote an article stating that thr materialists did have a cult. dpchattopadhyaya is of similar view. this is attested by haribhadrasuri in his saddarshanasamuccaya wherein he tells " bhasmoddhulanaparaah, kapaalapaanayah" etc. for the caarvaaka-s. after all they could not fall from the heavens !

  

some dharmas'aastra advises to have a materialist thinker in a royal court for his unbiased(secular !) judgement on situations. can some one kindly name this dharmas;aastra ? regds.
