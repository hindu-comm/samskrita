Respected Sirs,

I have a scanned PDF version of Barhaspatya Sutra - in devanagari with English meaning - running to about 100\*2 pages and 6+ mb size; a little too big for attaching to this mail. I however attach a copy of the front page. I do not remember wherefrom I have downloaded it.

  

Sri Adi Sankara and Sri Madhwa have commented on and condemned the Charvaka. However, I am told that their 'purvapaksha' would be a better delineation of the principles of Brihaspati than Brihaspati himself can describe; and in the next section, the *samadhana* is [mentioned.in](http://mentioned.in) His Sarva Siddhanta Sangraha and Madhwas comment/ criticism is contained in Sarva Darshana Sangraha.

  

I also have a handwritten copy of a Brihaspati Sutra (which appears to be different from the above mentioned 6 mb version - This was copied by me from some work from Connemara library about 30 years ago. This could probably excerpts from the earliear version.I will digitize and send after a few days if any one is interested.

  

With respects

R Subrahmanian
