thanks sir. i got it: the alias is baarhapatya arthashastra for brihaspati-sutra-s. in fact artha n kaama are intimately related.

that's how manu says: arthakaameshvasaktaanaam dharmajnaanam vidhiiyate / etc.

  

all materialism may not be hedonism. there are sections within the lokaayata-s. jayanta bhatta names them as dhuurtaah and sus'ikshitataraah.rgds
