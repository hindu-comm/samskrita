Sri Abhyankara Mahodaya,



I feel it my good fortune and be blessed to receive your good wishes for Deepavali. Kindly accept my hearty greetings to you and your family.



Incidentally, we in the South, consider this year to be Manmatha (or Manmadha as per local pronunciation). I find it is Plavanga for you. I have noticed during my stay in Varanasi that during the Sankalpas they use two different year names, 12 years apart, - the recitation would run somethng like -Soura Chandra Manabhyam Manmatha nama samvatsare, Barhaspatya manena Plavanga Nama samvatsare. Or it could be due to difference likeVikrama Samvat, Saka Samvat and something else. In places like Andhrapradesh, Karnataka where Chandra Mana is used, it is '*amant'* and the year begins in March; they call it Yugadi. In UP etc where they use Pournamant Chandramana,the month beginnningis 15 days ahead. In Maharashtra, perhaps (I do not know) they use Yugadi date (Gudi Parwa) for new year and the month is perhaps Pournamant. I would like to be enlightened about your system.



With respects

R Subrahmanian
