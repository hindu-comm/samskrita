आत्मीय कौशिक जी,

  

there are 3 simple rules:

  

1\. if a word has म् as the last letter and the letter after it in the following word is a स्वर it is written as म्  

  e.g. अहम् आनंद:

2\. if a word has म् as the last letter and the letter after it in the following word is a व्यञ्जन then म् converts into a dot (ं) and is placed above the previous letter. e.g. अहं कृष्ण:

  

3\. when म् comes at the end of a sentence, it is written as म् -- e.g. राम: अहम्

  

जय श्रीकृष्ण
