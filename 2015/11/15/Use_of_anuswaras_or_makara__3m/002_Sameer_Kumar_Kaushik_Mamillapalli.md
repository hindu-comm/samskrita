Dhanyavaadah bhaskar mahodaya!

  

So, does that mean that when we are writing vibhakti-pratyayas say in a table form to learn/teach should we use makara instead of anuswara?

like if we are just writing raamaabhyaam (trthiya dvivachanam), I should be writing रामाभ्याम् instead ofरामाभ्यां, correct?

Many shadba manjari's out there use the formरामाभ्यां

  

Regards,

Kaushik
