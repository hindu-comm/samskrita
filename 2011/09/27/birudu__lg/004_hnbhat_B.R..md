Dear Mukund,

  

You are mixing two words used two languages.

  

As Mm. Vimalaji quoted, Monier Williams had noted more than two variants for the same word. There is no etymology for this word available. Possibly may be some loan words either other Indo-European languages or Dravidian Languages. See the entry in T Burrow and Emeneu Etymological Dictionary:

  

<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:165.burrow>

  

Like many other loan words, it takes different pronunciations and forms in Sanskrit in addition to native phonetic and grammatical habits:

  

विरुद, + अलंकृत would be fine than the other विरुदु \> बिरुदु - विरुद etc. native expressions. 



5414*Ta.*virutu title, banner, trophy, badge of victory, pedigree, genealogy.*Ma.*virutu valour, prize gained by conquest, trophy, blazon, family device; virutan an accomplished warrior.*Ka.*biridu,**biruda**, birudu panegyric, praise, an honorary distinctive mark, badge of honour, distinction, developed power, valour; birida man of distinction, etc.*Tu.*birdů, birdoligè badge of honour, show, display, prestige.*Te.*birudamu, birudu title or mark of.

  

Hope this would answer your query.
