\<I m curious to know that this classification of Women is an invention  
of the  
writers of eroticisms or is it mentioned at other places also (like  
Purana  
or other sources) \>  
  

LOL...  
  
It is quite likely that similar classifications, with possible  
variations on minor points, exist in other old sources. They were all  
of them products of the same male-dominated women-objectifying genre  
of literature and I suspect even in its heyday did not contribute  
anything worthwhile to the sum-total of human knowledge. I for one  
would not like to exercise my admittedly limited knowledge in  
exploring those arcane recesses of learning and would refrain from  
trying to satisfy the curiosity of the querist.  
  
Others may take their individual stands on the query...
