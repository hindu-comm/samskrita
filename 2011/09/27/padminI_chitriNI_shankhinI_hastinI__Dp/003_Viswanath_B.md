I don't recall off my head where exactly I read, but it was during a related reading for Prataparudriyam - The author says that for a nayaki (women) multiple classifications exist  
  
- prouDha etc, based on certain classification,  
- vasakasajjika etc, based on another,  
- padminI etc based on yet another classification....  
  
the author states that if we need to know total number of combinations, we need to basically multiply the number from each of these classifications (permutations & combinations).  
  
So, I am trying to say that - for an alankara treatise it is considered a valid classification. It must be in use.
