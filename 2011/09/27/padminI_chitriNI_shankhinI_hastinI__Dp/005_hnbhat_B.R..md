Sorry. I wanted to say I don't recall such classification in any other works on Alankarashastra and if you are sure, you can provide the source so that everybody can share your knowledge. It may be possible, if you want to classification of Kamashastra which is properly the domain of erotics and all the heroines are females with which Kamashastra or any works on erotics. There are many other works on this subjects. The present one quoted has been given with the title in the first post and need not be confused with other works.

  

Before I finished, I pressed send button.
