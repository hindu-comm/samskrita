Ok, I went back and checked couple of books I have. They do have a mention of this classification, but a mere mention of classification and mentioned thus -  
  

> *padmini, hastini etc is a classification based on jAti and not > avastha. Rati manjari describes them thus - \<skipped>. More details > can be obtained from kama shastra.*  

  
The above is from kavyalankarasaMgrahamu, a telugu book.  
  
Here is a mention of this from prataparudrIyam (with the ratnApaNa vyAkhyA)-  
  
कामशास्त्र प्रसिद्धाः पद्मिनी चित्रिणी प्रभ्रुतयॊ जातिविषॆषाः ज्ञातव्याः  
  
पद्मिनीति ॥ प्रभ्ऱुति ग्रहणाच्छ्ंखिनीहस्तिन्यौगृऱ्ह्यॆतॆ - लक्षणादिकमेतासां कामशास्त्र एव द्रष्टव्यं  
  
I am not sure this counts as a classfication, technically made by these books, But It appears to me that they are counted in as classification, but not explained. Am I right in thinking so ?
