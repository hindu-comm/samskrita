It is a simple optional form of सन्धि after "r" consonants are duplicated. Any consonant, following "r" or "h" preceded by a vowel, could be optionally duplicated whether it is followed another vowel or a consonant by these two rules:.

  

8-4-46 अचो रहाभ्यां द्वे ।

aco rahābhyāṁ dve \|

  

8-4-47 अनचि च ।

     anaci ca \| 

  

In print or writing it is conveniently not duplicated or not. Both could be found. अर्कः, अर्क्कः, धर्मः - धर्म्मः etc. In Malayalam manuscripts, they are invariably duplicated in the case of many words after रेफ. In print it is conveniently ignored for the facility in manual typesetting. Only some printers of the 19th century used the duplicated forms in print as they are found in manuscripts.

  

Even though the duplication is optionally prescribed for consonants, following "h" also, only it is observed in the case of those following "r" only. The commentaries give examples ofब्रह्म्मा। अपह्न्नुते।also, but such are hardly found in writing in manuscripts. Probable reason is the convenience in reading the non-duplicated letters in both cases, for ignoring the option in the rule. In the earlier case, it may be that the option was not used due to difference in interpretations, as can be seen in this page it is made obligatory when writing the words containing the sequence.
