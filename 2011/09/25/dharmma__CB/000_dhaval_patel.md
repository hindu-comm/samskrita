hi all,

First of all, I would like to bring it to the notice of the group that this is the way the letter succeeding the 'ref' are written in old manuscripts...

At least in my region..

They duplicate the letter following धर्म्म instead of धर्म...  कार्य्य etc..

I found this in a printed book published in late 19th century.... republished recently

  

So i guess this phenomenon is not older than 150-200 years..

  

Is this the same throughout India?
