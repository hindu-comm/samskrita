The following are quotations from some Veda regarding the treatment to be

given to new born calves of cows.

  

“tasmaat vatsam jaatam dasa raatrir na duhanti”

  

Meaning that for the first ten days after calving the cow should not be milked.



“aasangavam maatra saha charati”

  

From the 11th day on wards the calf should be allowed to go with its mother

till the sangavakala i.e. about 9 a.m.

  

I would request members of this group to identify the Veda and quote the

full passage where these occur.

  

Thanks in advance.
