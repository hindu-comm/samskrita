I think you were referring to this:

  

–*वेदाहमेतं*पुरुषं महान्तम्। आदित्यवर्णं तमसस्तु पारे। सर्वाणि रूपाणि विचित्य धीरः। नामानि कृत्वाऽभिवदन्यदास्ते।

  

And here also it means I know (that) this great पुरुष bright as the Sun, beyond the reach of darkness, .... etc.

  

श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषद 3/8

  

and as far as I am aware, it could not be translated as He knows "I" and etam related to पुरुष etc. object of the verb and अहम् as the subject of the predication. If it is your problem, better to base your interpretation on some earlier learned commentaries than the learned members here.
