Esteemed friends,  

  

I have a question about a verb form as it appears in two sources.



First, in the Bhagavadgītā we have this:



vedāvināśinaṃ nityaṃ ya enam ajam avyayam... Bh.G_2.21a



Then, from the Śvetāśvatāropaniśat, we have:



vedāham etaṃ puruṣaṃ mahāntam... ŚvetUp_3.8a

and also 

vedāham etam ajaraṃ purāṇaṃ... ŚvetUp_3.21a



Each instance has ‘veda’ as a verb form. Are they the same verb form in each instance?

And could the two Śveta quotes be interpreted as saying, “He knows the ‘I’ as the Supreme Person,” and “He knows the ‘I’ as this Undecaying, Ancient”?

  

Those are my questions. Here now is what I have found, in trying to answer them myself:  



Radhakrishnan’s Gītā translation has “He who knows that it is indestructible and eternal...” for the pāda that I quote above. The verb form (using western grammar terminology; and pardon me for that) would be 3^(rd) person singular perfect active. Correct?



Radhakrishnan’s Upaniṣads translation has “I know the supreme person...” and “I know this undecaying, ancient...” for the above-quoted parts of the two Śvetāśvatāra mantras.



I would have expected “vedāmyaham” for “I know,” rather than “vedāham.”
The word veda would seem to mean "he knows."



Whitney’s Grammar says (821.c) “The perfects veda and āha are everywhere used with present value.” That statement helps, but does not solve my query.



Again, could the two Śveta quotes be interpreted as saying, “He knows the ‘I’ as the Supreme Person,” and “He knows the ‘I’ as this Undecaying, Ancient”?

  

And I am grateful in advance for any help the learned members may wish to offer here.
