If Whytney's statement could not solve your mystery, I think none can help. His statement is basted on Panini's rules strictly :

  

3-4-83 विदो लटो वा ।

  

  

which substitutes optionally past tense suffixes to the present tense. Normal would be in the 2nd conjugation group as वेत्ति - in the 3rd.sing. and 1st person it would be वेद्मि and not वेदयामि for this verb. 

  

veda, vidatuH, viduH\| 3rdperson

vettha, vidathuH, vida\| 2ndperson

veda, vidva, vidma\|1st person

  

Normal Present forms:

  

vetti, vittaH, vidanti - 3rd person

vetsi, vitthaH, vittha\| 2nd person

vedmi, vidvaH, vidmaH\| 1st person

  

The order is Sanskrit and not English 1, 2, 3 hope you can rearrange them for your convenience.

  

3-4-84 ब्रुवः पञ्चानामादित आहो ब्रुवः ।

  

i.e. it is used in only first five personal suffixes 1st person sing. du. pl. and 2nd person sing. due. but not in plural and not found used in 1st person anywhere.

  

Aha, AhatuH, AhuH\| 3rd person

Attha, AhathuH\| --2nd person

--  ---- ---- 1st person(see below for the normal forms)

  

normal conjugation:

  

bravIti, brUtaH, bruvanti\|

bravISi, brUthaH -brUtha\|

bravImi, brUvaH, brUmaH

  

Both verbs belong to 2nd conjugation group. Sorry I could not use IAST unicode for transliteration.

  

Just for your guidance I have produced the correct forms with optional and normal forms for the verbs you have cited. Pardon me if I could not understand your problem precisely.

Hope this may help. You may refer to the translation of SC Basu for the meaning of the rules. Hence I have not attempted for the sake of clarity.
