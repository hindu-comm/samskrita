Dear Brian

I can partly reply to this:

BG veda +avināśinaṃ

Here veda is 3^(rd) or 1^(st) sg per act root vid – he knows the indestructible, the eternal....

The other two uses from SU but - looked this up and vedAham is written in SU so it means I know.



I think there is the phrase vedo’ham in classical Sanskrit – meaning “I am veda”, ie refering to the vedas as scripture .

Vimala
