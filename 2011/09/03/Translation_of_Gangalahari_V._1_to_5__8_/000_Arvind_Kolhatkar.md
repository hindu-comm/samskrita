Dear Group,

I am trying my hand at a plain translation in English of Gangalahari,  
which, after it is complete, I shall upload to [scribd.com](http://scribd.com) or a  
similar site.

I shall upload here 5 verses at a time, each successive batch coming  
after 4-5 days. I shall be grateful for any criticism and suggestions  
for change and improvement.

This is the first lot of 5:

समृद्धं सौभाग्यं सकलवसुधायाः किमपि तन्  
महैश्वर्यं लीलाजनितजगतः खण्डपरशोः।  
श्रुतीनां सर्वस्वं सुकृतमथ सुमनसां  
सुधासोदर्यं ते सलिलमशिवं नः शमयतु ॥१॥

Your waters are the manifestation of the prosperity and good fortune  
of the entire earth and of the great power of Lord Shiva who created  
the universe out of his play; your waters are the epitome of the  
shrutis and totality of the good deeds of great minds. May these  
waters that claim kinship with the heavenly nectar douse our sin. 1.

दरिद्राणां दैन्यं दुरितमथ दुर्वासनहृदां  
द्रुतं दूरीकुर्वन्सकृदपि गतो दृष्टिसरणिम्।  
अपि द्रागाविद्याद्रुमदलनदीक्षागुरुरिह  
प्रवाहस्ते वारां श्रियमयमपारां दिशतु नः ॥२॥

You flow of waters, sighted but once, immediately reduces the  
destitution of the destitute and takes away the darkness from the  
heart of those with sinful designs. May this your flow of waters that  
speedily teaches destruction of the tree of ignorance reveal to us  
limitless good fortune. 2.

उदञ्चन्मार्तण्डस्फुटकपटहेरम्बजननी-  
कटाक्षव्याक्षेपक्षणजनितसंक्षोभनिवहाः।  
भवन्तु त्वङ्गन्तो हरशिरसि गङ्गातनुभुव-  
स्तरङ्गाः प्रोत्तुङ्गा दुरितभवभङ्गाय भवताम् ॥३॥

When Parvati, mother of Ganesh, casts at you a jealous glance with  
eyes red as the rising sun, that momentary discomfiture creates mighty  
waves in you, O Ganga, as you ride on the brow of Lord Shiva. May  
those waves cause destruction of the men’s worldly sins. 3.

तवालम्बादम्ब स्फुरदलघुगर्वेण सहसा  
मया सर्वेऽवज्ञासरणिमथ नीताः सुरगणाः।  
इदानीमौदास्यं भजसि यदि भागीरथि तदा  
निराधारो हा रोदिमि कथय केषामिह पुरः ॥४॥

O Mother, great haughtiness that I enjoyed your protection led me to  
scorn all other gods. Now, O Bhagirathi, if you turn your back on me,  
whom can shelterless I beseech? 4.

स्मृतिं याता पुंसामकृतसुकृतानामपि च या  
हरत्यन्तस्तन्द्रां तिमिरमिवचन्द्रांशुसरणिः  
इयं सा ते मूर्तिः सकलसुरसंसेव्यसलिला।  
ममान्तःसन्तापं त्रिविधमपि पापं च हरतु ॥५॥

Like the rays of the moon illuminating the darkness, you remove  
ignorance even from the minds of even those men who have not performed  
a single good deed. May you, whose waters even gods enjoy, take away  
the anguish in my heart and my sins of three kinds. 5.
