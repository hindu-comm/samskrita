Dear Group,

While going through a digital copy of नवनीत, a compilation of pre-  
modern Marathi poets first brought out in the 1880s, parts of which  
was prescribed text from several generations of school children till  
about 1930, I came across the following narration of  
अष्टसात्त्विकभाव. They are स्तम्भ, प्रलय, रोमाञ्च, स्वेद, वैवर्ण्य,  
वेपथु, अश्रु, वैस्वर्य and may be translated as stiffness, faint,  
goose-bumps, sweat, paleness, trembling, tears, suppressed voice.

Though I was aware of the term अष्टसात्त्विकभाव, I did not know their  
composition. Here is the answer. Were there similar भावs for रजोगुण  
and तमोगुण too?

Some of these may be seen in Arjuna at the commencement of the War,  
when he is standing in the middle of the two armies:  
...  
सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति॥  
वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते।  
गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिभूयते॥  
न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मन:  
निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव॥
