The impression I carried was that the 'bhAvA'-s were in fact based on Sankhya tri-guNa-s.



Gita verses that gave me that impression are:



ye chaiva saattvikaa bhaavaa raajasaastaamasaashcha ye .  
matta eveti taanviddhi na tvahaM teShu te mayi .. 7\\-12..



ahi.nsaa samataa tuShTistapo daanaM yasho.ayashaH .  
bhavanti bhaavaa bhuutaanaaM matta eva pR^ithagvidhaaH .. 10\\-5..



pR^ithaktvena tu yajj\~naanaM naanaabhaavaanpR^ithagvidhaan.h .  
vetti sarveShu bhuuteShu tajj\~naanaM viddhi raajasam.h .. 18\\-21..



 The elaborate descriptions in Chs. 14 (guNatrayavibhAga), 16 (daivAsurasampadvibhAga), and 17 (shraddhAtrayavibhAga), have many aspects

that would fit the Sankhya classification.



 The characteristics that Arvindji quoted are discussed in Narada Bhakti Sutra (#68). In that context Arjuna's state of mind fits the rajo-tamasika mould rather than sattvika (as per triguNa perspective)).
