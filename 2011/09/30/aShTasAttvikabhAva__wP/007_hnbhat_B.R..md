सांख्य- philosophy accounts for every thing in the creation except पुरुष thesentient, the 24th पदार्थ accounted for in creation. This includes मनस् also, so it included in the purview of the त्रिगुण theory and any feeling would be comprised of the two others also with the proportionate majority. This is purely philosophical view.

  

नाट्यशास्त्र deals with the physical expressions of oral and mental ideas and here it deals with the expression of mental feelings. All the शास्त्र-s have their own domain and there is some factors commonly shared while differing in maintaining their own views as different from others. So any follower of one system can uphold its view, over the others with arguments favorable to its own. This is a fact I have noticed in many of the शास्त्र-s. That is how we get from the same set of trio ब्रह्मसूत्र, भगवद्गीता and the same sentences from उपनिषत्-s many different schools of Vedanta philosophy, अद्वैत, विशिष्टाद्वैत, शुद्धाद्वैत, द्वैत etc.

  
यत्नेनानुमितोऽप्यर्थः कुशलैरनुमातृभिः ।  
अभियुक्ततरैरन्यैरन्यथैवोपपाद्यते ॥  
  
- वाक्यपदीय। । १.३४ । ।  
  
yatena anumitaH api arthaH kushalaiH anumAtRubhiH ।  
abhiyuktataraiH anyaiH anyatha eva upapAdyate ॥ (1.34)  
  
  
  
Many logicians may have used lots of points and proved a point. But that does not stop more intelligent people coming along and using more logic points and prove it wrong. The same is true for them also. So, matters of faith are never proved by logic.
