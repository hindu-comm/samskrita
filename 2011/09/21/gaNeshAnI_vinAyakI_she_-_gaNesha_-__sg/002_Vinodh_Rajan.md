The Female Ganapati according one legenedis actually Bodhisattva Arya Avalokiteshvara subduing Ganapati.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~



In one Legend, Avalokiteshvara assumes the Eleven-Headed form, and subdues Vinayaka who causes destruction. He cuts of the head of Vinayaka and places his head on to himself, thus acquiring the form of Vinayaka.



In the other Legend, Avalokiteshvara takes the form of a woman to seduce Vinayaka and prevent him from creating obstacles. But Ultimately in Essence, both Avalokiteshvara & Ganapati is seen as the manifestation of Buddha Maha Vairochana. Hanguag, a disciple of Amoghavajra, explains that the Bijas of Avalokitesvara hrīh & Ganapati gaḥ is an expression of "Provisional Reality".

Bauddha Tantras probably have some esoteric meaning associated the twin-form.
