In Japan, there are more than 250 temples > dedicated to Lord Ganesh and He has names such as Kanki-Ten, > Kangi-Ten, Shooten, Vinayaaka, or Daishoo Kangiten. In Kamakura (a > city in Japan), there is a temple (Hookaij-Ji) with allegedly the > oldest statue of Ganesh in Japan; it is locked and supposed to have > been preserved locked there from the year 1333. The Twin God is > nanten - male, nyoten - female Ganesha. It also represents His/Her > ego.
