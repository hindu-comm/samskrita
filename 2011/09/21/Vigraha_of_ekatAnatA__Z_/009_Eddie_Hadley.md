Dr,



 Now that I’ve done (a little) homework, I can only say that Amara 3.1.79 is somewhat reticent, as regards on the matter in hand.



I am, interested though, in the .pdf that you attached earlier.

I must confess, that I always have to transliterate these original source texts, before I can read them – something of a handicap, I’ll admit.



Is there a source for the extraction please. An e-book, that allows for a ‘save as text’, then I can get to work on it.

The extract in question is requesting a password.



Many thanks,



 Eddie
