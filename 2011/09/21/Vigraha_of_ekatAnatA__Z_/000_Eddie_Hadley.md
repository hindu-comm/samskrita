Dear members,



 Regarding the vigraha of ekatānatā.



In their commentaries, neither Vyāsa nor Bhoja gloss ekatānatā.

When I presume to make the attempt myself, with a little help from Huet’s site, I completely resolve the external saṃdhi to come up with the following breakdown:



ekatānatā \> eka-tānatā \> eka-tā-natā \> eka-tāḥ-natā.



And, whereas I get to the stem nata, the commentators, especially in the English translations, seem to regard the stem as ekatāna, coming from ekatānatā,

but this would only be correct if the suffix -tā, is recognised as a legitimate attachment by virtue of being of known usage in Classical Sanskrit.

The MW, for example, does not seem to think so.



Furthermore, nata, as meaning ‘bowing down to’, with the sense of submitting and yielding up control to the influence of another, has better concordance.



Anyone wish to comment on these (mis)interpretations?



With regards,



 Eddie
