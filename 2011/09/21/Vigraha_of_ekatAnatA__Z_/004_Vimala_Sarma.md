Nityananda Mahaodaya

The verb root tan is to stretch, and as a noun it can mean something that stretches like a string but also tanu is thinness and hence body also. Not sure that it is cognate with tantra which means control or rule or doctrine, and also has more specific meaning in religious practices.
