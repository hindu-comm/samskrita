tan (तन्) primarily means to spread, extend, expand, develop or bring forth, as in the seventh verse from Ramcharitmanas (root aa + tan)  
  
स्वान्तःसुखाय तुलसी रघुनाथगाथाभाषानिबन्धमतिमञ्जुलमातनोति  
  
Although Apte gives a root as तन्त्र् (*tantr*) meaning "to rule", I still think several meanings of "tantra" come from "tan". To stretch is one meanings of tan as you pointed out, which I think is the meaning in "tantra" (तन्त्र) when it means a string or cord, also see *tantrin* (तन्त्री) as in the stringed instrument. I read somewhere the word "tantra" as in the sampradaaya comes from तनोति develops/expands and त्रायते protects. I think in Robert Svoboda's works on Aghori Vimalananda but I am not sure.
