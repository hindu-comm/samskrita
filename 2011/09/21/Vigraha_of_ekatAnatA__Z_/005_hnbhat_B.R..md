It is perfectly correct as split by Mm.Vimala as AND the above IS A PERFECT BREAKDOWN.   
  

It is supported by the lexicons and Indian literature too:  

  

ekatāna, ananyavṛtti, ekāgra, ekāyana, (ekasarga, ekāgrya, ekāyanagata) are the synonyms. meaning the same as meditating the mind on any object.

  

ekatāno ' nanyavRttir ekāgraikāyanāv api। (Amara 3.1.79)

  

ekena bhāvarasena tanyate vistāryate iti ekatānaḥ, tan vistāre karmaṇyaṇ

  

ekastāno vistRtiḥ - yasya saekatānaḥ - are the vigrahavAkya for the adjective/noun ekatAna. which could be used in different senses in different contexts.

  

tatra pratyayaikatānatā = sajātīyapratyayapravāhaḥ , dhyānam

  

ekatānatā is the state of being ekatāna (ekatāna-tā) derived from the word ekatānatā which can be either a primary derivative or a baruvrIhi compound, as per the requirement of the case.

  

The above term has been explained in the above context as the state of continuum of a similar cittavRtti (thought process) as explained in the Sutra.

  

I don't think this will satisfy Mr.Edie as my English wordings may not be capable of conveying the idea as I think.
