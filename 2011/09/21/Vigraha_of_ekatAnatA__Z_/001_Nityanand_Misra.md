I think the word comes from  
  
eka-tāna-tā  
  
tāna from the root "tan" and means (as per M-W) a fibre (cogante with "tantra") or a "tone" (as in a musical tone). It is also a technical in Hindustani classical music and is seen in words like "tānapurā" (a string instrument) and in phrases like "tān\[a\] mār\[a\]nā" (to set a tone).  
  
ek-tāna then would literally mean having a single tone or metaphorically, as M-W shows - having the mind fixed on one place.  
  
The abstract noun then becomes eka-tāna-tā.  
  
My attempt at vigraha would be  
  
एकः तानः यस्मिन् तद्रूपं ध्यानं एक्तानं तस्य भावः एकतानता  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
