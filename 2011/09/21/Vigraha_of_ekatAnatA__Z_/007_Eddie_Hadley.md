All,



There is indeed the language barrier, and the cultural also. But these can be surmounted.

( I will look closely at the (Amara 3.1.79) in both scripts . . . progress will be slow . . .)



So, yes. But let me try to re-phrase my question to put it in its wider perspective.

The MW, does provide for the derivations of abstract nouns with entries –tva or -tā as illustrated below.

*Where known to be in actual usage.*

Where that is not the case, such derivations, are not entered?



As suggested, It is one thing to provide the meaning of a word from clear and unambiguous usage via concordance/context.

It is indeed quite another to do the reverse, to take a given word, disassemble it by rule, and provide that as a meaning.

So, bearing in mind I have some more homework to do with the Amarakoṣa - is the presence or absence of a references to –tva or -tā, in the MW, of significance?



So to better frame my inquiry, I could say that whereas, ambiguity is to be welcomed in literature, where words are an end in themselves, when it comes to instruction manuals, where words are but means to an end, progress to those ends, require that doubt and uncertainty as to those means, must first be resolved.





Thank you all for your patience.



 Eddie



Some examples of their (abstract nouns) presence:



abhi-rūpa-tā

• f. the state of being learned or well educated, Kād. \[68,2\]



a-sva-ga

• (a-sva-), mfn. not going to one's own home, homeless, AV. xii, 5, 45.

• (asvaga) -tā f. homelessness, AV. ix, 2, 3; xii, 5, 40. \[123,3\]



. . . and their absence:

eka-tāna

• mfn. directed to one object only, having the mind fixed on one object only, closely attentive, Kathas. Daś.

• of the same or equal extent, L.

• m. attention fixed on one object only, BhP.

**tāna**  
• *m.* (√ 3. *tan*) a fibre, *Suśr. i, 25*.  
• a tone, *MBh. ii, 133* and 391; xiii, 3888, *Kum. i, 8*.  
• 'a monotonous tone (in reciting, *eka-śruti*), *KātyŚr. i, 8, 18, Vait. Bhāśik.*, *Nyāyam. VPrāt. Sch.*  
• an object of sense (or = *tātparya*), *L.* (cf. *eka-*).  
• \[442,2\]





and **ekāgra**, which again, does refer:

ekāgra

  
• *mfn.* one-pointed, having one point, fixing one's attention upon one point or object, closely attentive, intent, absorbed in, *MBh. Mn. i, 1, BhP. Bhag. &c.*  
• undisturbed, unperplexed.  
• known, celebrated, *L.*  
• *(am)*, *n.* (in math.) the whole of the long side of a figure which is subdivided.  
• *(am)*, *ind.* with undivided attention, *MBh.*  
• *-citta* *mfn.* having the mind intent on one object.  
• *-tas* *ind.* with undivided attention, *Vet.*  
• *-tā* *f.* *-tva* *n.* intentness in the pursuit of one object, close and undisturbed attention.

• (*is*), *m.* N. of a man, *Lalit.*  
• *-manas* *mfn.* fixing one's mind on one object, closely attentive, *MBh. Pañcat.* \[230,1\]

this all, is before I look into what Amara had to say . . .
