bhagavad gItA mentions dharma sanAtanA in the context of kula dharma(1.39)

  

The term sanAtanadharma also finds mention in the writings of Swami Vivekananda, and existed as a native expression of the term "Hinduism" in the form of organizations, etc. during the same period. The latter is corroborated, again, in the writings of Swami Vivekananda.

  

The term "Hindutva" was coined by Savarkar during hisincarcerationat the Cellular jail at Andaman, which unless I am mistaken, was at a time after all of the above. From a purely apolitical perspective I would like to mention that certain elementsinimicalto the interests of dharma and/or India have, on the record, sought to retroactively apply the term "Hindutva" to constructs that they call "Brahminism", etc.

  

Perhaps learned group members can shed light as to if the termsanAtanadharma also finds mention in some other texts from the dharma canon.

Manas
