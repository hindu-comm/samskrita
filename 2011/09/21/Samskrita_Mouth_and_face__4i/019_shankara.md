Swami Vivekananda's Complete Works Volume 6 contains the word Sanatana Dharma (<http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_6/vol_6_frame.htm>). Can we assume that Annie Besant borrowed the term "Sanatana Dharma" from Swami Vivekananda.

"............For instance, many Hindus regard the phrase sanatana dharma to be a synonym for “Hinduism,” and believe that the notion of a single sanatana dharma, or “eternal religion,” goes back at least to the Rg Veda. Few people are aware that this phrase was popularized first in the writings of Aurobindo. He borrowed the notion of Hinduism as sanatana dharma from the theosophist Annie Besant’s 1903 book Sanatana Dharma: An Elementary Text-book of Hindu Religion and Ethics....."

All references of सनातन derived from the अव्यय - सना meaning ancient:  

In all the above references, as Mm. suggested it is used as qualifying a duty since time long. I have produced this only for the earliest reference to the usage of the word सनातन in respect of धर्म and nothing more than that it serves. In the statistical references, it qualifies many things brahma, shakti, etc. And सनातन is one of the four sons of ब्रह्मा, the creator born at the beginning of the creation according to पुराण-s.
