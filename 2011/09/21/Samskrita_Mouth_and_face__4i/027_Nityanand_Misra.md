Disagree.  
  
In the verse cited below मुखारविन्द does not mean just the mouth. Rather it means the mouth, the lips and the area of the face (head if you like) between the lower lipand chin (this region is called असिक in Sanskrit). Surely in other poems and in the paintings shown, Krishna's toe (प्रपद) is in the mouth and not the whole foot (पद) - pun unintended :).  
  
If मुखारविन्द in the verse means just the mouth, the verse means "placing foot in the mouth" which would be अनभीष्ट and even odd if you ask me. Placing the foot on the lower face makes more sense.  
  
Unless you have a different definition of mouth which includes the lips and the असिक and the chin. To me, mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and saliva, as Wikipedia says. And this mouth has no साधर्म्य with a lotus.
