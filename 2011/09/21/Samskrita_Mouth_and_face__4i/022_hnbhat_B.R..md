It is a simple guess that a combination of the two words "*sanātana*" and "*dharma*" having independent usages (the second used in many shades and modes) and in collocation were conveniently formed to convey the idea of eternal religion to denote the Vedic Religion restricting their meaning to their needs.

  

"*sanā-tana*"(born out of*sanā*the permenant or ancient) - meas
eternally existing; i.e. The Veda's are eternal scriptures according to Hindu ideology (either created by God or existed by themself (without any person to create them in the form of "sound" श्रुति.) and the whatever found in Veda-s are सनातन - Vedic, and धर्म again the natural attribute, (the collective characteristic of a people) specialized to mean religion. The coined word Eternal religion would mean Vedic Religion and then restricted to the culture attached it to the people as a whole. This would land us in the current usage of the term meaning Hindu religion.

  

Thanks Brian and all others who tried to trace the earliest usage of the word in its meaning inthe current usage.
