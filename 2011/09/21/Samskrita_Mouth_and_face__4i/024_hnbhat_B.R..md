I could not understand you question. I have quoted references of the collocations of these two words and independent usages. And in the recent post I have formed a mere guess how it came to be related to the currency of the two terms in the recent usages of 19th century. Probably not as a compound word in its current meaning, was used earlier.

  

If you want the definition of धर्म here is one:

  

*धारणाद्*धर्ममित्याहुः धर्मेण विधुताः प्रजा ।

यः स्याद् धारणसंयुक्तः स*धर्म*इति निश्चयः ।।



There are many technical senses

  
  
Puranic usage of the collocation:  
  
गमनं चैव कृष्णस्य पार्थस्यापि च दर्शनम ।  
  
कृष्णाद्वैपायनस्योक्ता युगधर्माः सनातनाः ॥१०५॥  
  
Here-in the attached file you can find the Yugadharama as described in the Purana-s in each Yuga. If you want the other implications of the word धर्म it would be another lengthy file than a compact message in the reply.
