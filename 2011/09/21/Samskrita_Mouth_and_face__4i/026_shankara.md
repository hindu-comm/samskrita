Bhat Mahodaya,

  

Dhanyavadah,

  

In fact my question was not about the explanation of the term "sanatana dharma", but "from which period did Hindus start calling their religion (or the Vedic religion) as Sanatana Dharma". From Brian's search we can safely infer that Vedic religion was known as "Sanatana Dharma" at least from the beginning of 19th century CE.

  

Was this term used to denote Vedic religion before that too in any of our scriptures? For example Viveka Chudamani uses the word "Vaidikadharma" in the initial verses. Similarly has any Acharya or Rishi made use of the word "Sanatana dharma" to denote "Vaidika dharma"?  



regards  
shankara
