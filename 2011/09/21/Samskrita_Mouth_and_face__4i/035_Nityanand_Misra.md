*The whole foot in the mouth*? I have never seen or heard that. The toe in the mouth more common and in line with basic proportions of The Vitruvian Baby, if you like.  
  
The mouth is a cavity, and I cannot see the sadharmya between cavity and a lotus. Maybe your definition of mouth or sadharmya is different from mine.
