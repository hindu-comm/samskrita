Vimalaji,

Many thanks for your kind words and suggestions.

Reverting to the seeming fact that Sanskrit has the same words to denote mouth and face, I would like philologists and etymologists to react on this curuious feature. Does this anomaly exist in any other language? What could be the reason for this?

Regards

Murthy
