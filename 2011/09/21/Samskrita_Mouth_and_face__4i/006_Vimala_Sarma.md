Dear Vasu Mahodaya

Thank you – I had a quick look at Manu and it Chapter 4, 138 - not 128; this says something different in Manu.

The translation is:

He should say what is true and he should say what is pleasant. He should not say what is true but unpleasant and what is pleasant but untrue – that is the eternal Law.

Olivelle comments that this is the first time the expression occurs.

There is also a reference to the eternal law in Chapter 9 .64 of Manu.

Vimala
