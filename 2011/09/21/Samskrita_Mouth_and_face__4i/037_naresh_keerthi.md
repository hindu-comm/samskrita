The conflation of face and mouth is not a sanskRt specific detail. Cognitive Linguists will point out that this is a feature in several languages all over the world. We can see reflections in the American English expression 'Stuffing your face' which obviously means stuffing ones mouth.  
  
The face is identified with with the face because of pragmatic reasons. If one were to see a hitherto unseen worm or animal, to tell apart the head end from the tail end, one looks for the end which has the mouth.  
  
As a general principle of body plan design, animals have their mouth close to the head end, and this end also determines the direction of motion. Thus we can see three meanings for मुख - in the sense of the mouth, the metonymised sense of the face and also in the metaphorical sense of 'head' or important \[pramukha, mukhya etc.\]  
  
The process of emblematising a part of a whole for thew whole is termed Metonymy or Synecdoche. K.Kunjunni Raja says that PANini and Bhattoji dIkSita both accept the metaphor and metonym \[lakSaNA and gauNI\] as properties \[vRtti-s\] of words.\[Panini and metaphor, 2002\]  
  
Using this principle, मुखारविन्द being a metonym for the mouth and
*पदारविन्द being a metonym for the toe should be acceptable.
