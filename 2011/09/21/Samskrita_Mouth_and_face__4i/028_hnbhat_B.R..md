You can differ with your own words. pacing the foot in the mouth is the common picture when viewing the little children play and as picture is depicted in the paintings. If you cannot imagine the साधर्म्य the poet intended, you can imagine Krishna placing his foot in his face without enjoying the beauty of the poetry.

  



  

जाता लता हि शैले न जायते जातु लतायां शैलः।

चित्रं कनकलतायां शैलद्वयमद्य जातम्।

Wish you all the best.
