The below are the instances from•sanā-tana

  

•sanā jyotiḥ sanā svaḥ RV.9.4.2a; SV.2.398a.

•sanātana (MS. °nā) ṛṣhiḥ TS.4.3.3.1; #MS.2.7.20: 105.5; KS.39.7

•sanātanaṁ vitataṁ ṣhaṇmayūkham TB.2.5.5.3b.

•sanātanam enam āhuaḥ AVÇ.10.8.23a.

•sanātanā ṛ^īiṣhiaḥ see #sanātana etc.

  

In all the above cases, it means ancient and as it seems there is no association even with "dharma" as in the later texts. Text sources have to be checked to confirm.
