Hi  
  
The word **Dharma  
  
**I have mentioned in one of the threads that one can read P. V. Kane History of Dharma Shastra Vol1 Part 1 where he devotes 2 pages for explaining the meaning and usages of Dharma. The book is available at DLI or [archive.org](http://archive.org) for a download.  
I have attached those pages  
  
The word **Santana**  
  
If one reads the messages of this thread  

-   The meaning of Sanatana has been explained clearly by Dr. Bhat and
    others.

&nbsp;

-   Dr Baht has tried to explain the term from Vedic, Puranic and other
    sources by giving quotes and brief explanations.  
-   Grammatical derivations have also been explained.

  
So I feel the word Santana Dharma has been adequately and clearly explained.  
  
On the political Neo Vedantic, Sarvekar's and other explanations usages etc there are enough materiel and books of the World wide web. A simple google search will give a list.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
