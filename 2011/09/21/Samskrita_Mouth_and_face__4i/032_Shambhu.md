Iyer ji’s and Shankara ji’s original questions have been answered in  
the thread – the phrase “sanAtana dharma” is of recent usage, possibly  
not earlier than 18th century. i.e., it is in the recent history  
(political discussion here is unavoidable):  
  
Vasco da Gama set foot on India’s shore in 1498. The first Christian  
Mission (in Bengal) permitted by the Mogul ruler was in 1517. The  
missionary work and conversions spread first on the coat-tails of the  
East India Company and later of the British Raj, and the “new  
religion” was presented as the latest “Dharma” to the “heathens and  
idolaters.” The usage of the phrase “sanAtana Dharma” took ground as a  
reaction, to distinguish the numerous mother traditions from the newly  
claimed one.  
  
This is an example of the vaitAsa vr\`tti of the Indian (Hindu) society  
at play. As the East-West encounter became fierce through the First  
War of Independence (1857), so was the usage of “sanAtana dharma.” The  
Hindu mind, instead of examining, confronting, and dismissing the  
Western construct of Christianity as a “Dharma”, devised an  
alternative way of “ducking out” of the conflict, typical of its  
vaitAsa vr\`tti.  
  
Therefore the meanings of the words “Dharma” and “sanAtana” supplied  
by other members are relevant to the ramifications of the questions  
raised. If the usage started sometime during the 16-19th centuries and  
it is not in the Hindu scriptures, the next question to ask is: “Why  
was this so, while Dharma of the Veda-s is undoubtedly sanAtana and  
One?” Also, where is then the need to qualify it with ‘sanAtana’? It  
is clear that the sAdhAraNa (common) dharma of the Veda-s is one for  
all of humanity, creatures, earth, galaxy and the full universe.  
Manusmr\`ti characterizes this in terms of Dharma’s ten lakSaNa-s. The  
‘yama-niyama-s’ of Patanjali or the historical Buddha’s ‘eight path’  
re-phrases the same. There is little religion in these lakSaNa-s but  
they suggest a way of living for being happy at the individual and  
social through cosmic levels.  
  
Dharma’s origin is the BhagavAn and it is disclosed in the Vedas (for  
example, tani dharmANi prathamAnyAsan – rik in puruSa sUkta). It does  
cover the religions (upAsanA schemes) of us the earthlings but it is  
not limited to them. It is not the “Vedic religion”, whatever it may  
mean. ‘sanAtana dharma’ as ‘Hindu religion’ is also a Western  
construct.  
  
vaisheSika sUtra 1-1-2 gives this definition: ‘yato-abhyudaya  
niHshreyasa siddiH sa dharmaH’ - it is that which leads to obtaining  
abhyudayam (material prosperity) and niHshreyasa (tatva jnAnam, i.e,  
tat = tvam jnAnam). Since no subject is stated in connection to  
Dharma, it means that the schemes of Dharma apply to all.  
  
In karNa parva (69-58), BhagavAn kr\`sNa lectures Arjuna thus:  
‘dhAraNat dharmamityAhuH dharmo dhArayati prajAH’ – holding is Dharma;  
Dharma holds (supports) all the creatures.  
  
dhamma (Dharma in Pali) was Buddha’s central teaching. “esa dhammo  
sanAntano” (dhammapAda 1-5) is possibly a re-phrasing of manusmr\`ti  
4-138 cited by Vasu ji (note: it is verse 4-138, not 4-128). devAnAm  
priya ashoka’s “Dharma chakra” has made its way into the state emblem  
and the national flag of India. Dharma in its human applications is  
essentially secular. Within the ambit of Dharma, an individual is free  
to worship anyway he/she desires or not worship.  
  
The rules of sAdhAraNa Dharma cover all that is secular and the  
visheSa Dharma-s cover the spiritual practices. We go astray in our  
debate or thinking when we equate Dharma to religion. Dharma is  
unique, applicable to all, and is sanAtana, is indeed apauruSeya,  
since it is in the Vedas. As the foolishness of the 15th century Euro-  
centric mind vanishes, we may drop the pre-fix ‘sanAtana’ and simply  
say ‘Dharma’, since it is ‘sanAtana.’ anyway.

But what might be most interesting is that even the little bit of text displayed in the search pages shows that there were Indian cultural organizations with the phrase in their title. One of these, for example, is from 1841, and mentions someone as the General President of the Sanatana Dharma College Managing Committee in Lahore:

\> "...a few years ago, an association was established to support the tottering fortunes of Hinduism, called the Sanatana Dharma Rakshini Sabha, or Society for the Preservation of the Eternal Religion..."

\> Thus the contemporary usage may have emerged in part in the context of polemics. Interesting, because of recent work I've been doing, I happen to know that the same is true of Western phrases, such as the very word "religion" itself (see Platvoet, J. (1999). Contexts, concepts & contests: Towards a pragmatics of defining 'religion'. In J. Platvoet, & A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), The pragmatics of defining religion: Contexts, concepts, and contests (pp. 463-516), Leiden; Boston: Brill.)

\> \>Swami Vivekananda's Complete Works Volume 6 contains the word Sanatana Dharma (<http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_6/vol_6_fra...>). Can we assume that Annie Besant borrowed the term "Sanatana Dharma" from Swami Vivekananda.
