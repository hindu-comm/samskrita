Brian,

  

Thanks for finding the reference to "Sanatana Dharma Rakshini Sabha". Based on this info we could safely infer that the word "Sanatana Dharma" was in use at least from the beginning of 19th century.

  

Have any scholars done research on the origin of the word "Sanatana Dharma"?  



regards  
shankara
