I just had a look at your site and I like it very much. All the grammatical tables are very handy. Under each example just list all words similarly declined, but ood to have also a comprehensive list of irregular declensions – I am always needing to these.

Excellent work – I like both your sites!

It looks to me that Sanskrit does not differentiate between mouth and face. Am I right?
