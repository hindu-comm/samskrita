Friends,  

  

A colleague of mine sent me a message on this topic. I will copy and paste here only the relevant parts. But the gist of it is that, without doubt, the term 'sanatana dharma' was in use long before the comparitively recent incarnations of Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo, and/or Annie Besant.

  

Take a look:

  

 ... if you're not already aware of this mode of searching, you might also find it interesting to see what happens when you do a Google Book Search, Advanced option, with dates specified as 1899 or earlier:

  
<http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22sanatana+dharma%22&tbs=,cdr:1,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201899&num=50>

  
Today it gives 28 results (in the future, if more old books are scanned, it might give more). One of them is an obvious error (a copy of the Theosophist listed as 1609 rather than 1909). But what might be most interesting is that even the little bit of text displayed in the search pages shows that there were Indian cultural organizations with the phrase in their title. One of these, for example, is from 1841, and mentions someone as the General President of the Sanatana Dharma College Managing Committee in Lahore:

  
<http://books.google.com/books?id=eSsdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22sanatana+dharma%22&dq=%22sanatana+dharma%22&hl=en&ei=abJ8Tv-ZO4vYiALp8uDwDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ>

  
Another reference from 1876 mentions the 'Sanatana Dharma Rakshini Sabha, a highly orthodox Calcutta 'Society for the preservation of \[Hindu\] religion.'"

  
<http://books.google.com/books?id=xngOAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA3-PA34&dq=%22sanatana+dharma%22&hl=en&ei=arV8TvnPGorYiAKxvJmHDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22sanatana%20dharma%22&f=false>  
  
And there is an 1878 reference from a Baptist magazine which states:

  
"...a few years ago, an association was established to support the tottering fortunes of Hinduism, called the Sanatana Dharma Rakshini Sabha, or Society for the Preservation of the Eternal Religion..."

  
Thus the contemporary usage may have emerged in part in the context of polemics. Interesting, because of recent work I've been doing, I happen to know that the same is true of Western phrases, such as the very word "religion" itself (see Platvoet, J. (1999). Contexts, concepts & contests: Towards a pragmatics of defining 'religion'. In J. Platvoet, & A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), The pragmatics of defining religion: Contexts, concepts, and contests (pp. 463-516), Leiden; Boston: Brill.)
