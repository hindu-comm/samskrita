This one has been around for a long time. Much commentated in Devanāgarī, with Roman transliteration and French, cross-links etc.



The Swami has been promising to add English for years, but very little has been done. And the texts not Unicode, but are Legacy ASCII Code Page fonts and copyrighted.



I am mentioned in the dispatches for my beta testing in 2005, but I’ve given up on the site for the lack of English.
