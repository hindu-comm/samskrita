For your first question, you will find many lie avglessons, learnsanskrit, gssslessons if you search for them. They are already in some of the threads here and you can search for them.

  

For the second, you have either to consult the generating webpages or otherwise learn Ashtadhyayi of Panini or Siddhantakaumudi, which gives every form as per rules of Panini. No shortcut. In either case, it requires toil yourself and none others' toils will help you to get acquainted with grammar completely to your satisfaction.
