A few paisa-s worth suggestions regarding resources to provide strong  
motivation to learn samskr\`tam:  
  
1. Samskrita Bharati <http://samskritabharati.in/>  
2. Groups like this one  
3. Satsangam with those interested in, working in, and spreading  
samskr\`tam  
4. Many online resources  
  
Equally important would be some change in lifestyle – gaining jnAnam  
as the focus of life, and relegating money-making to secondary level  
(i.e., reducing our greed quotient and ego). Motivation to learn  
samskr\`tam and all that are in samskr\`tam will naturally follow.  
  
Children (and others around us) will follow if we walk the talk.  
  
Regarding ‘motivating others to take up samskr\`tam’, we need to  
recognize that any human brethren has three desires:  
  
1) to live one more day, i.e., forever – therefore he seeks food and  
health, i.e., money  
2) to know about everything there is to know  
3) to be eternally happy  
  
Forget motivating those whose sole focus is #1 – it is waste of your  
time and life. They will learn in next life or thereafter, after  
paying off all their karma-bound bills in life.  
  
You will have success with those whose focus is #2. No samskr\`tam  
means no real jnAnam (exceptions are of course exceptions). That will  
lead to #3.  
  
#1 will not lead anywhere but to the recycling plant of life. Tell #1,  
he/she may wake up and join the ranks of #2.
