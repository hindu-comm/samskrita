Well it is a serious question that must be answered. Dear all Sanskrit lovers, we are thinking seriously to find an answer to it. So can we solve various problems from environment, corruption, diplomatic disturbances, religion conflicts, decrease in level of morality, destruction of social values, Psychological disasters, political rivalry, greediness and many other from even Science? Once Sanskrit provides solutions, then obviously Sanskrit will dominate. So now what can we do now.  
obviously we can try to search different Puranas, Shastras, Veda, Gita, Ramayana etc. and make a good article for suggesting a solution written in Sanskrit language. These articles should be published in famous news papers and magazines of different countries.By referring again and again to Vedic literature and Sanskrit mantras in our suggestive articles we can attract people from different field towards Sanskrit. By developing lost sciences like mantra therapy to solve mental and many physical diseases and many other vedic age science we can heighten interst and status of sanskrit. Making Seminars or Discussions on Veda may not help in making Sanskrit a front line language.  
I am a M.Sc of Statistics. So I am serious to develop Sanskrit from language of literature to language of solution to even from my University days.  
Dear Sanskrit lovers, I request all to seriously suggest further on this topic. We will try our best to implement and coordinate these suggestions. Its a promise.  
Thanks,  
regards,
