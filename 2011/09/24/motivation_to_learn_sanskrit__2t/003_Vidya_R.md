Namaste, Shri Sai!  
  

What is the motivation one needs to care for their children? Similarly, what is the motivation one needs to take care of their parents?

  

If answers can be found for the above two, you have the answer for the motivation one needs for learning Sanskrit. 

  

Regards,

  
Vidya
