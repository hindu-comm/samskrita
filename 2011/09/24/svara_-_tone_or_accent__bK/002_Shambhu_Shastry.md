Some say that all the sevan vsara-s are in the Vedas, for example, see here <http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/svaras.pdf>.



Kanchi periyavar (in his book "Hindu Dharma") refers to pANini and several other ancients on shikSA: <http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part6/chap4.htm>: "Abhicali, Candrakomi, Yajnavalkya, Vasistha, Katyayana, Parasara, Mandavya, Narada and Lomasa are some authors of Siksa sastra whose works are extant."



May be, the details are somewhere in them.``
