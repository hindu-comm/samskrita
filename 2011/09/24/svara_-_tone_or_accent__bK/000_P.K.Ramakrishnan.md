tone or accent.



In Sanskrit it is called swara. There are three such swaras –

udaatta, anudaatta and swaritha.



In writing, symbols are used to denote them.



Vedas are transmitted only by hearing.

So they are called srutis. The meaning of a word changes

depending on the swara.



The most quoted example is this.



Vrittra was an enemy of Indra.

Vrittra’s father performed a yajna

chanting the mantra –



“INDRASATRURVARDHASWA”



He intended that his son Vrittra should become the

destroyer of Indra.



But buy a wrong swara, it meant “let Indra the

enemy prosper”. He accented the word on the

first syllable. Afterwards Vrittra was killed.



Here is the rule –



मंत्रो ह्नीन: स्वरतो वर्णतो वा

मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह /

स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति

यथेन्द्रशत्रु:स्वरतोपराधात् //
