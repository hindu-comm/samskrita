Dear Dr. Bhat,  
  
yes, I designed it ...  
  
If you come across one of the cases you mention, please send me a  
mail. I am always interested in improving the DCS.  
  
I may also announce that the tagging program with which the corpus is  
built will be published soon (\~ 2 months?) as freeware. So, if you are  
interested, you may contribute by adding the kind of Sanskrit  
literature you are doing research in.  
  
Finally, any new features are listed at  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_center>  
Just scroll down to the bottom of the page, version 1.4.  
  
Best, Oliver Hellwig
