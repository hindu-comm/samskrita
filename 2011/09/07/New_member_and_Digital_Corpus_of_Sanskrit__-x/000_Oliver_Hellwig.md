Dear list members,  
  
as an introductory mail - I have just subscribed to your list - I  
would like to notify you that there is a new version of the Digital  
Corpus of Sanskrit available at  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php>  
  
Hope it helps to promote the study of Sanskrit!  
  
Best regards, Oliver Hellwig
