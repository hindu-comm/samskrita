Oliver,

Congratulations are the order of the day.

As one who has used your earlier, and very useful Sanskrit OCR, and  
documentation (which however, I needed to translate into English, via my  
schoolboy German before I could use it - hint), I very much look forward to  
your promised new release.

  
Best regards,  
Eddie
