Dear Vishvas,  
  
\~3 million "tagged word" actually means "lexical units". Ex.: vanavAsa  
would be analyzed as vana+vAsa and, therefore, as two lexical units/  
tagged words. The number of strings (vanavAsa) is clearly less.  
  
Download in xml format will be available in some future version.  
  
Best, Oliver
