Dear Prof. Oliver,  
  
I had a question about the DCS corpus. I read: " Users can search for lexical units and their collocations in a corpus of about 3.050.000 manually tagged words.". I suppose this refers to 3\*10^6 tokens rather than unique words.  
  
This is amazing to me as a novice interested in NLP for संस्कृत. Is this corpus available for download?
