Welcome to our group of Samskrita.

  

I am one of the regular user of your DCS, if it is you who designed the DCS.

  

I have a suggestion to make if you please. I could not find several words when I searched by stem. I think the search is confined to the words in corpus entered in the database, analysed by stem. Or there may be something wrong in the analysis of the words therein. Whenever I find such instances, I will notify you.

  

Notwithstanding anydiscrepancy either in the data-entry or analysis, I find it useful to locate the sources of usage and wide range of meaning collected from different sources. It still needs much more data included in the corpus and it would be an excellent source for reference.

  

Can you enlighten what is new in the revised version so that I can make use of them in future searches.

  

Hope you will enjoy your stay with us.
