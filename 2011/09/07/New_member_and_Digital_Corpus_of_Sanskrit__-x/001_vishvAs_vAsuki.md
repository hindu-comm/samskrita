हृद्पूर्वकं स्वागतं, Dr Oliver. I recently had occasion to informally survey the tools that exist for Sanskrit processing/ programming, and I stumbled upon a link to your [OCR program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SanskritOCR). We sanskrit enthusiasts appreciate your contribution and efforts very much. I am curious to know if there is a version of this program which can run on linux? Also, is it open source?
