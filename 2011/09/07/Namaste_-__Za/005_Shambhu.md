Shukla yajurveda 36-17 is the ‘dyau shAntiH’ mantra (without the  
repetitions noted in Abhyankar ji’s message). This adyAya 36 also has  
the famous gAyatrI, apo hi STA, sham no devI, sham no mitraH, etc.  
mantras (several of these are Rik-mantras) - invoking peace as well.  
It concludes with the ‘tachchakSurdevahitam…. Pashyema sharadaH  
shataM’ mantra.

‘asato mA’ is in the br\`hadAraNyaka Upanishad-brAhmaNa 1-3-28.

A good text that examines the mind and its nature, and what is meant  
by true peace, is Patanjali’s yoga sutra. The entire exercise in the  
astAnga yoga is to stop the agitating and circular tendencies of the  
mind (yogaH chitta vr\`tti nirodhaH) and reach the peace state of  
samAdhi. It is said that, in that state, what is in is out, and what  
is out is in, and the in-out distinction is proved as an illusion of  
the mind. Corollary: If peace sets ‘inside’, it does so ‘outside’ as  
well.

mAndUkya Upanishad and Gaudapada’s kArika dwell into our states  
(jAgrat-svapna, etc.) and the turIya - Atman is the peace, Atman is  
everywhere. Next to digest would be the madhu vidyA in the  
br\`hadAraNyaka 2-5 and the Rigveda 1-90 (where the well known ‘madhu  
vAtA r\`tAyate’ mantra appears). gAyatrI mantra (Rigveda 3-62-10) and  
the madhu mantras are blended together in the br\`hadAraNyaka (6-3-6  
through 6-3-12) for realizing the madhu vidyA.

It is said in the traditions that if you want peace, begin your  
sAdhanA by doing sandhyA vandanA and gAyatrI japam daily during the  
two sandhyA times. Rest of the above steps and the peace of the Atman  
will follow as calf follows the cow. 'Mere intellectualization without  
the sAdhanA of gAyatrI will not help much to prevail peace' is the  
view in the traditions.
