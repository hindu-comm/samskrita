'Peace' is indeed beyond words, Shambu.

The संस्कृतम् scriptures and the sūtra of Patañjali are two very different  
types of literature. The former deal with ritual matters of a heavenly  
nature, and for the community in general. The latter with more earthly  
matters, it addresses matters of a personal and social nature and for the  
individual.

Anyway, however pleasant, or otherwise be words, they cannot but allude to  
experience, which is the issue here.

  
1. 'Which of the many ways, forever being quoted and re-quoted, actually do  
what they promise.

Really a question of what that 'promise' actually is - presumably a  
state of mind, an actual state of consciousness?  
The scriptures allude to glories, allegorically to what it is to likened  
to, but not to what it actually is, to the actual experience.  
For that we have to look elsewhere, to Patañjali.

Where we find that, by all accounts, it is a state of mind occurring under  
somewhat extreme conditions. Patañjali actually enumerates four means by  
which the state of Samādhi arises.  
If the 'state of Samādhi' is indeed synonymous to 'the state of Peace', then  
Janma, Auṣadhi, Mantra, and Tapaḥ are the four means.

Anyone know of any more?

Each word, itself being grammatically generic; Auṣadhi for example, meaning  
'herbs', embraces a wide range of unspecified substances and Mantra, of  
which you speak are numerous.

Thus are the 'means' listed.

There remains, the actual experience, so promised.

Does it actually exist? Which leads to the second issue.:

  
2. What is the experience actually like?

Janma? I was not born into that state, so I cannot speak of that experience.  
Auṣadhi? Nor can I speak of 'herbs'. Anyway, the recipe for Soma juice, has  
been lost with the passing of the eons.  
Mantra? I spoke of my experience with Mantra. Something which you appear to  
have overlooked.  
Tapas? which I understand to mean conditions of extreme physical and/or  
sensual deprivation, self-induced or otherwise. These are not uncommon, and  
are well reported as NDE or 'Near Death Experiences'.

Correlating my own experience resulting from the mantra, with that reported  
of the NDE, they appear to relate to the same conscious phenomenon.

It is such words that relate actual experiences, are sought. As otherwise  
they but hinder the quest.

Indeed, as you imply, more than mere intellectual understanding is required  
to accomplish the task. Again, Patañjali does more that merely allude, to  
the more than vicāra, does he not?

However they are accomplished, every 'means to that same end' has the same  
four tasks to do.  
To successively restrain the Vitarka-vicāra-ānanda-asmitā-rūpa-anugamāt  
samprajñātaḥ.

To retrain (nirodha) the 'mind' form doing what is most natural to it.  
To restrain as meaning 'to hold back from movement or activity'. The mind  
being, something that does not 'move' anywhere, that leaves its 'activity',  
of which it does do, quite a lot!  
They form a hierarchy of four generic activities, all four of which have to  
be 'stopped' for 'peace to reign'.  
Then, and only then, so poised, can a sea change in consciousness occur.

Of, course, there's a bit more to the sūtra that that, each of those earlier  
two categories, Vitarka and Vicāra, are themselves composed of further  
specific activities, that have to be 'restrained' one by one.

  
As an observation:

Were the Patañjali sūtra to be properly interpreted, you could say the  
such as the Sir Isaac Newton's of this world, were doing non other that  
'making Saṃyama' on a triangular piece of a novelty glass, otherwise known  
as a prism, when he made his discovery that white light (of the external  
kind) is actually a bit more complex than it first appears.

No doubt, with a specific objective clearly in mind, he settled himself  
down, quietly, putting himself into a suitable frame of mind for the task,  
before he began.

As far as I know, he didn't explain, 'how' he did what he did?

No problem, however, as Patañjali has that 'how', and clearly embraces the  
external and the internal light, together with the bi-directional means of  
traversing the gulf between.

You can only get out of a piece of glass, or stone or whatever, only the  
knowledge that is in there in the first place, and you can't know that in  
advance.  
Patañjali knew how to mine a richer vein - how to harness the intellectual  
powers themselves, all the better for the individual to apply them, or not,  
as individual circumstances dictate.

A wise man indeed!
