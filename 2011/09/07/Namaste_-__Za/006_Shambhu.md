Here is the audio of taittirIya tradition’s Ghosha shanti  
<http://www.raaga.com/play/?id=76520>. Udaka shanti, puNyAhavAchanam,  
malApakarSaNasnAnam, etc. have collections of many shanti sUktas.  
Rigveda shanti sUktas are: 1-89 (aa no bhadrA sUktam), 5-51-11 to  
5-51-15 plus khila 2-4 (svastinomimItAm sUktam), and 7-35 plus khila  
2-13 (shaMvatI sUktam). Rigveda’s five pavamAna sUktas (most of them  
with soma as devatA) also aim for peace dividend. The peace-seeking  
sAdhaka has to practice the ten yama-niyamas and recite these in the  
stipulated manner. Various preparatory and ‘purification’ rituals  
incorporate these with this very purpose.

All of the above, with nitya gAyatrI japam as their integral part, may  
have to be practiced to experience (and understand) ‘peace’ based on  
Hindu/Vedic scriptural perspective. How peace is established through  
all these? Tradition holds that it is in the proper verbal or mental  
recitations of these mantras, done systematically and repeatedly while  
abiding by the yama-niyamas. Mere meaning and understanding don’t add  
much to create this peace within or out. An elder once said, “If the  
mantra practice is gold, mantra meaning is bringing fragrance to  
gold.”
