You do not cite a reference.

I find the quotation, along with many others that are cited, but even there, it is anonymous.

None however, offer any insight from the psychological or physiological perspectives.



For that, the rhythmic nature of the brain waves may be of interest – something that the ancients had no access to.

These appear to synchronize the disparate mental activities within the brain, such that the results arriving into conscious sphere, all derive from the the same original sensation.

Thus allowing for the different lengths of time that these process take – otherwise there would be confusion of information.

Something that can be observed with cases of brain damage etc.



As a philosophical observation:



A distinction should be made, between the inner and the outer worlds.

The inner is very local. The outer is of different nature, altogether.

And is not to be pacified. Viz. The children, the mother-in-law, not to mention certain Austrians who gets their ancient symbols back to front . . .



Such matters have many interesting perspectives.
