Swaroop,



 From the viewpoint of cognitive science, brain activity?



A leading researcher in this field is Susan Greenfield <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Greenfield,_Baroness_Greenfield>,, whose specialty is the [physiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology") of the [brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain "Human brain").



She appeared on a UK TV programme recently, of the ‘a day in the life of’ variety, inducing an out-of-body experience in a person, simply by standing behind the subject and touching the back of the subject’s head, at one and the same time, as the subject touched a head in front of her. As simply as that.



Also, there is currently an International research project on those same OOB experiences, that are frequently reported in the operating theatres, where patients whose hearts stop, are reviewed. A local hospital is partaking. Again very simple! Somewhat unusual, but distinctive objects are placed above eye level, hidden on shelves etc. and known only to the researchers conducting the research.

Patients that report ‘floating above their own bodies, lying there ‘dead’ on the operating table, are gently questioned as to what they ‘saw’.



As regards ‘peace’. Do you mean direct experience of ‘pure consciousness’, etc.?



Anyone can try that for themselves, in a straightforward physiological manner, by gently voicing ‘the humming sound’,



The attention will be drawn to the physical sound resonations within the body



At first, in the abdomen.

As the pitch of the ‘Aum’ changes from the ‘Ahh’ to the ‘oh’ the resonance travels up to the chest area.

Continuing into the nasalised ‘mmm’ the resonance moves into the forehead.



The attention follows the physical sensations, that are quite prominent given the circumstances under which the practice occurs.



No thoughts, just senses. Gradually a white light, not white like snow, but clear like air, begins to grow with the ‘mmm’ bit.



The experience is initially, rather like having car headlights shone onto closed eyes – but without the car!



The intensity can vary per session.



And very occasionally, there follows a blackness, a speeding through a tunnel with a tiny light at the end, growing larger, then sudden emergence into a world of, well, pure consciousness, pure light.



At that point, those on the operating tables, will report an ancestor, or divine figure appearing to say that their time is not yet come (- or perhaps, that should be ‘not yet gone’).



In my, case, however, being very much alive, there was just the vague sensation like ‘can’t stay up here all day, time to get back down’.



I can easily see, how that state can be regarded as blissful to those whose normal state is that of physical or mental pain, but otherwise, it is just ‘different’.



There is no need to go to the forests or the caves!



Anyway, that is merely the beginning.

View the ‘light’ as ‘mental energy’, suitable harnessed, and then there is the practical matter of learning how to apply it.



The subject for research yet to be completed . . .





Best wishes



Eddie,

Can scholars help me to understand the meaning of Peace from Indian Scriptural Perspective?  
Secondly I want to know how peace can be established at the individual and universal level by studying understanding and practicing Indian Philosophical Texts?
