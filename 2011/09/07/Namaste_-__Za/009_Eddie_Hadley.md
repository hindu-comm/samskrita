SL,



 On the subject of ‘Peace’.



The question raised is 'Which of the many ways, forever being quoted and re-quoted, actually do what they promise’?



The question is indeed an ancient one. Raised in many a scripture.

Raised. Yes. Affirmed. Very much so - In Chapter after Chapter, Verse after Verse, Scripture after Scripture.



But answered? Not really - at best, the inquirer is gently advised to seek the answer elsewhere.

Is that not so? I’m sure that members of these forums, raising the question here, are already very familiar with the literature.



Maybe they are actually taking the advice given therein?



 from:

 <http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-29.html>

 and:

 <http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-04-34.html>

Allowing for poetic license, my reading would be:



‘*Ask from them that have first-hand experience*.’



1\. Those that can, not only describe the sensation,



2\. but provide detailed instructions of not only how they accomplished the task, themselves,

but instructions that they know, again from experience, help others to do so, also.



An observation of mine:



 The first enumeration above, is yet again, mere testimony of the existence of ‘Peace’ or ‘Truth’.

 The second, is very rare, priceless even, more valuable than gold, even at today’s prices.



Words, on the other hand, especially these days, beget even more words. Ever more obstacles . . .



Eddie
