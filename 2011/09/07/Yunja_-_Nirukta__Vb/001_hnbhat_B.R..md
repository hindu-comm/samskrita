

Can you please explain the word in which it is used with meaning?

  

Otherwise, there is no need of looking for a derivation of a technical term used in a शास्त्र. You may have to look into Jyotish texts for a definition of the word, unless it is a common word used in classical Sanskrit language.

  

I could not find any such word as you typed in roman letters in शब्दकल्पद्रुम a standard Indian Lexicon.
