Advaitanjoo,

Take a look at the software, you can download from here,  
<http://www.taralabalu.org/panini/>  
Registration is free.

  
It is not a document as you request, but you can copy and paste extracts  
from the screen, though the fonts used are legacy, not Unicode.

  
Once installed, click on 'AnuVrittis' on the main Menu - and scroll around.

What you are looking for you will see under the 'Type' (of Sutra) heading.

As to the accuracy of the labels . . .

If you are at ease with the Devanāgarī, there's a lot of commentary there.

  
I am sure other members can give you a more comprehensive list of documents.

  
Eddie
