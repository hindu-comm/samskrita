Dear all,  
  
Firstly I would like to thank you for all the wonderful knowledge  
which is being shared on this forum. it has really enriched my study  
of the Sanskrit language and I always feel I have somewhere to turn  
when I am stuck with something!  
  
Secondly, Venetia's samjna sutra document is a useful tool for a  
Panini beginner and made me wonder if there is a document/book with  
the ashtadhyayi split sutra wise - i.e. by the 6 types of sutras  
1 संज्ञा - definition;  
2 परिभाषा - interpretation;  
3 विधि- rules;  
4 नियम - restriction;  
5 अतिदेश- extension;  
6 अधिकार - header/domain.  
  
I would love a copy if anyone has created such a document.  
  
Kindest regards  
  
Anjana
