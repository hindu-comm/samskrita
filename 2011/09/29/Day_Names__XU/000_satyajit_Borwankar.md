Respected members,



I am relatively new to this wonderful group.



Regarding the indian names of the days (Somavaasara, kujavaasara etc), I had the following questions:



 1. Were these names in use in Vedic times, or there were only tithis or not even tithis mentioned in the Vedas?

 2. When is the earliest known mention of the day names found in our literature of old?

 3. How is it that the Indian names and the ones we commonly use iEnglish, have the same planetary references in some cases.

 4. It is said that the day names travelled to India from the West around the third century AD. Is it so.

 5. When and how the days got associated with various deities (e.g. Monday for Shiva, Tue and Fri for Devi and so on).I mean are there some earliest references to various associations.





I am aware that this is not truly related to Sanskrit but I am making bold to put my doubt across to this learned assembly





Thanks in advance,



Satyajit
