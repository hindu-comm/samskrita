Dear Sundar,  
  
Thanks a million for the help. Although I searched in Scribd, I did not know that I should enter the string differently like this: Bhagavat-Puran; hence my efforts were futile.  
  
Now I have got the right material to read on.  
  
Thank you so much again.  
  
With regards,  
Parvathy
