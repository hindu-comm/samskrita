An anecdote on Patanjali.

  

Patanjali is said to be the incarnation of Adisesha

on which Mahavishnu resides.

  

Panani after writing the Ashtaadhyaayi desired that

someone should write a Bhaashya for this without whcih

few would understand the meaning. He invoked

Adisesha who appeared as a small serpent on the

folded palm (anjali) of Panini. So he was named

Patanjali - fell on anjali.

  

Panini asked Patanjali - Korbhavaan. (Who are you?)

Patanjali replied - sapoham. (I am sapa)

Panini - rephah kutah.  (what happened to r ?)

Patanjali - tvayaa apahritah. (taken away by you)

  

Then Panini found that he was the fittest person

to write the Bhashya for this Ashtaadhyaayi.

  

Interestingly there are several Bhaashyas like Sankara Bhaashya,

Ramanuja Bhaashya and so on. But only Patanjali's Bhaashya is

called Mahaabhaashya.
