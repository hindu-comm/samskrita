I wandered into the saMskRta collection of the UT library and saw tomes on non-pANinIya saMskRta grammars. All of them were jaina works (there was also chAdra-vyAkaraNa, but I understand that it agrees with pANinIya tradition.)  
  
AchArya hemachandra's work was in simple saMskRta which I could understand, and seemed to be arranged in a logical order. It is said that he did the work of pANini, bhaTToji dIkShita and bhaTTi combined! The varNas described included a dIrgha ॡ (not included by pANini), and used many saMjJNA-s not used by pANini. For example, it used sva instead of savarNa, called ए and ऐ "सन्ध्यक्षर"s - No mAheshvara sUtras - he simply lists alphabets in the beginning. It was obviously influenced by pANini - I saw uNAdi-pATha etc.. It supposedly has an adhyAya devoted to prAkRta. For some reason the wikipedia article says that this grammar deals with apabhraMSha and prAkRta (Don't know how accurate this is, because the initial bits I read was saMskRta).  
  
I am told that the haima vyAkaraNa tradition still continues among jainas to this day. I also saw a tome written in late 1800's by another jaina muni which seems to modify haima vyAkaraNa sUtras. And there was one preceeding the shabdAnushAshana, which supposedly influenced hemachandra and which seemed to more closely inspired pANini's sUtras.  
  
I wonder what the degree of equivalence is between pANinIya and the jaina vyAkaraNa in terms of shabdAnushAsana. Also I wonder if the jaina efforts have resulted in an easier vyAkaraNa.
