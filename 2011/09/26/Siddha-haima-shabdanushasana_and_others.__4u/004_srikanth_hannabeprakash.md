I would be very upset with the comparison on the use of sanskrit that deteriorates from vedic disciplines because, after Mahabharath, scholars were said that soon mankind will forget everything they learn easily in Kali Yuga, so they decided to write down the vedas in Brahmi (most probably Kannada/Telegu scripts). Later people in North India took Buddhism very aggressively, so a secular center of knowledge grew in Taxila. This led to many transliteration of vedas from Brahmi to Devanagari script. There the level of understanding the Vedas was low so Panini inspired by 24 of his predecessors wrote the Astadhyayi in Devanagari. His work was very vague to the general mass. So explanations were written by Patanjali. Though the Narada Purana were having ample emphasis on sanskrit grammar, the vedas themselves have a dedicated section of Pratyakshakyas. So using the Pratyakshakyas, Panini raises questions and arrives at settlements using his aphorisms. However, I would like to shed light on Sri Madhwacharya's works whose unparalleled judgement on very questionable debates of the Indology were written in grammar very different from Panini Grammar. His works are commented by his disciples Jayatheertha and Raghavendra teertha, It is worthwhile to note how beliefs and theology of Buddhism and Jainism were dismissed while all of these stocks of knowledge held borrowing of self and less of the eternal being. Jayatheertha's works and Madhwacharya's undertsanding give highlight on using knowledge of using Sanskrit with big collection of Dhatupathas and commentaries.
