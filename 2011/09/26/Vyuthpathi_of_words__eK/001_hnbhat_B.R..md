I can't understand the purpose of your question. There two methods of derivation and definition.

  

The first is the function of a निरुक्त of whom यास्क has laid down an outline generally, decoding the structure of a word according to its meaning. That is why it is called निरुक्त. य़ास्क deals with Vedic words, in the vocabulary of Vedic Words called निघण्टु sorted content wise.

  

वर्णागमो वर्णविपर्ययश्चद्वौ चापरौ वर्णविकारनाशौ \|.

धातोस्तथार्थतिशयेन योगस्तदुच्यते पंचविधं निरूक्तम्।

  

For Classical Sanskrit, अमरकओश functions as निघण्टु or vocabulary as for Classical Words used in Classical Language and so it contains both words used in Vedic Texts and Classical Literature generally. Only their derivations are differing in quality and quantify according to the needs of the context.. As for the derivation of etymological and grammatical decomposition of words, Paninian Grammar is followed generally.

  

Amarasimha doesn't give any derivation of the words than the collection of synonyms of words and a category wise gender analysis of the words at the end.

  

The commentators give the different derivations according to the Paninian rules generally. That is the source for the grammatical derivation. Other definitions offered by Puranic and other sources is just following the guideline of यास्क, but not necessarily follow their grammatical analysis offered by Paninian rules.
