Hi,  
Could any members please help me with a PDF version of  
  

1.  Vakyapdiya Vol 2 Edited by Raghunath Sharma published
    underSarasvatibhavana-Granthmala Series( I have Vol 1 and Vol 3)
    All my efforts to purchase this volume has been futile. 2.  Vakyapadiya with Prakiirnaprakash edited By Ravi Varma published
    under Trivandrum Sanskrit series

I have already made a rough draft and have got a publishers approval for a kannada and English Translation  
  
Help would be gratefully acknowledged  
  
Thank you,  
  
Warm Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
