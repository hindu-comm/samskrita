bhartRhari's vAkyapadIya is a work regarding the philosophy of  
language - i.e., general linguistics philosophy that transcends any  
one language. It is true that the book is written in saMskRta, and all  
of the examples are saMskRta. And yet, its discussions are widely  
applicable: it is concerned about the relationship between mental-  
meaning and sound-language. For matters regarding the philosophy of  
grammar, it has approximately the same weight of authority as the  
mahAbhAshya has in matters of usage.  
  
The book is not relevant for anyone who has a specific question  
regarding usage - e.g., what is the saptami dvivacana of "go".  
It is possible that our group has not had many discussions wherein we  
had to look into bhartRhari's insights. (I am not surprised that  
philosopjical issues regarding general linguistic philosophy come up  
rarely.) But I myself remember recently quoting bhartRhari's  
description of anvaya-vyatireka to extract meaning out of sentences  
during language acquisition.  
If someone is currently studying the vAkyapadiiya, I would be glad to  
read about their explorations.
