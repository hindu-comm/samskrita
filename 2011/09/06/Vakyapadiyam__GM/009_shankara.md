Ajitji,

  

The link to Volume 2 of Vakyapadiyam edited by R Sharma is disabled, may be due to copyright law. I too could not download it. If you write to [feedba...@gmail.com]() or [ba...@serc.iisc.ernet.in]() ([Dr. N. Balakrishnan](http://swati.dli.ernet.in/balki/), Associate Director, Indian Institute of Science,Bangalore) stating your purpose, they may sometimes send you a pdf of this volume.

  

I could not find the other volumes of TVM series of Vakyapadiyam.  



regards  
shankara
