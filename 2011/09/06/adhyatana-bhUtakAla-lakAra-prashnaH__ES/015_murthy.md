In this context may I quote a passage from "The student's guide to Sanskrit Composition" by VS Apte.

Page 142 Para 207

" But later Sanskrit writers lost sight of this difference between the Imperfect, Perfect and Aorist, and the three are found to be promiscuously used to denote merely *a past action,* whether recent, remote or not witnessed by the speaker; as "तदाहं किमकरवं क्वागमं किं व्यलपमिति सर्वमेव नाज्ञासिषम्" \[From Bana's Kadambari\]"
