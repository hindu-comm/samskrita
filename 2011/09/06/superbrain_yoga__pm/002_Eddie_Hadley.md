P.K.



And it’s not the first time that someone cashes in on common knowledge.

Someone calling himself a [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/asia/06maharishi-1.html) did it on a global scale, with the mantra.



As the ancients say, knowledge is power.

In itself, It is neutral.

Its application, however, is threefold.



Its balanced dissemination, likewise threefold.

 Thoppikaranam, also referred to as thoppukaranam is old news.

 It goes back to 2009, at least.
