Dear Sri Srikanth,  
My view in this matter is as follows:  
Sanskrit grammar has two aspects: syntactical and derivational. Derivational  
aspect is by and large unique to Sanskrit. In derivational part of grammar,  
you learn how one could derive say "raamasya" from the stem "raama" using  
Panini's theorem-like rules embedded in his sutras.  
If one gets a good knowledge of syntactic grammar and learns by heart  
declensions of important noun paradigms and conjugations of important verb  
paradigms, and one has ready in hand some standard books of grammar for  
reference and a good dictionary (Apte's) Eng->Sans and Sans->Eng. one need  
not bother to go to learn Panini's grammar. You need to learn Panini if you  
want to specialize in Sanskrit Grammar.  
Often by straigh away trying to go to Panini, one may get lost and learn a  
little of Panini and much less of Sanskrit.  
Regards  
Murthy
