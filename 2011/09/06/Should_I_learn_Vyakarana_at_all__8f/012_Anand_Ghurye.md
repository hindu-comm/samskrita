Dear Friends ,  
  
I have slightly different take on this subject .  
  
Given below is my understanding .  
  
Six vedangas are the precondition to learning of Vedas .  
  
The six vedangas are  
  
1. Shiksha (s'iks.a-): phonetics, phonology and morphophonology (sandhi)  
 2. Kalpa (kalpa): ritual  
 3. Vyakarana (vya-karan.a): grammar  
 4. Nirukta (nirukta): etymology  
 5. Chandas (chandas): meter  
 6. Jyotisha (jyotis.a): Knowledge of subject / attitude to learn  
  
Vedas is the body of knowledge that leads us to realisation in time to come .  
  
To properly study and practise this body of knowledge , precondition is learning six vedangas . So learning the grammar is a must . If you do not learn Vyakarana and Nirukta how do you make sense of any sentence in language or get to the meaning of it ?  
  
Having said that , what should be the sequence of learning the vedangas or should they all be learned simultaneously ? My opinion is that all should be learnt simultaneously . see , hear , speak , do , understand ,make mistakes and continue the loop . This way it is fun to learn , applied immediately and learnt automatically .  
  
The way Sanskrit was taught in my school days was sequential , boring , and tedious and far removed from reality . It was only in higher studies when I began to learn nyaya etc that I realised the beauty of the language .  
  
Now we run a course for spoken business english for graduates and 12 th standard students using Natural Language processing algorithms and neither grammar nor nirukta pose any problem .  
  
I will like to hear views of all learned members from the forum .  
  
Regards ,
