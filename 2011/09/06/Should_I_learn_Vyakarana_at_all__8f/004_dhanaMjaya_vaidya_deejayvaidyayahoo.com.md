\> I feel like if I keep on reading simple sanskrit magazines like  
\> (chandamama, sudharma, rachana, sampratam, vaak, sambhashana sandesha  
\> etc), prabhanda - nibhanda, text books etc, I could get a fair grip of  
\> Samskrit without studying Vyakarana.

That is probably corrrect.

The grammarian पतञ्जलि mentions those who say that : वेदम् अधीत्य  
त्वरिताः वक्तारः भवन्ति , वेदात् नः वैदिकाः शब्दाः सिद्धाः लोकात् च  
लौकिकाः । and he does not contradict this.

I.e., vaidika usage can be known by learning the veda, and correct  
laukika usage can be known from the practice of common usage.

However, note that non-native adult learners of any language (even  
modern languages) often cannot get this internal "instinctive"  
knowledge of the correctness of usage - native speakers of any  
language that learned the language as babies seem to have that  
"instinctive" sense of correctness of usage. Therefore we, being non-  
native adult learners of saMskRta, may benefit from learning grammar.

There is no need that the grammar be the system given by पाणिनि. Any  
system that helps you get the correct usage will do. Grammarians of  
the पाणिनि tradition agree that his is only a system of convenience to  
get to the correct usages. Once the correct usages are attained, the  
system has no significance. (उपेयप्रतिपत्त्यर्था उपाया अव्यवस्थिता: ।  
They are only ways to get to the ends, other than that the means have  
no standing.)

धनंजय
