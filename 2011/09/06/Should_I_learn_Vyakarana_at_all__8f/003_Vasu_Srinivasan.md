having gone through the same route to Samskritam my feeling is - there is no point being intimidated by the enormity. How muchever you learn, there will always be more to know, but as they say: lets take it one janma at a time :-)  
  
But Fact is, study of Sanskritam is much easier/better than it was 20-30 years ago with availability of so many pdfs, audio lessons, access to books, printed and rare etc. Sanskritam has never been this accessible (to public) than in the last 10 years (of the recent past).  
  
Learning for learning's sake and passion alone can be the guide - which you seem to have plenty already.  
  
Given that, I would say audio lessons like that of Siddhanta Kaumudi, Smt Sowmya Krishnapur ([ggss-lessons.org](http://ggss-lessons.org)), Swami Tattvavidananda's LSK (available from Arsha Vidya Gurukulam), BR Shankara's Panini are of immense help to immerse oneself in. Also there are several books available in shops like MLBD etc which can be used for reference etc. My favorite route has been the audio lessons, I can listen to it how many times ever I want, without letting others sense how dumb I am, and not straining the teacher's vocal chords ;-). Of course one can't ask questions to the mp3 player, but thats why this forum is for!
