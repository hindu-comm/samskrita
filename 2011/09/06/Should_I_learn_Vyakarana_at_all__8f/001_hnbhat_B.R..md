To be frank, if you want to learn VyakaraNa you can learn VyakaraNa. If you are satisfied with reading Chandamama, Sudharma etc. you can continue to do so.

  

"Necessity is the mother of invention." hold good in in this case also. If you are in need of learning VyakaraNa, you have to learn VyakaraNa only and nothing else. You will reep as you sow. If there is not necessity or need, no efforts would accomplish the goal.

  

  

There are many sites offering online teaching in Grammar, and language in general in addition to word generators, form generators and so many tools without learning grammar you can gain knowledge of the Sanskrit words. Choice is yours and the proper choice at proper time will help you if you want success in your endeavor.
