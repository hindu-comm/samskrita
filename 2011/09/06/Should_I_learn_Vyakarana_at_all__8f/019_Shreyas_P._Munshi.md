Respected Kalivardhana Sir,  
I am taking the liberty of writing to you because I read your mail to a student that you are an SB teacher.  
In the first half of July this year, I attended at Delhi the SB's 14day sanskrit sambhaashaNa aawasiya shibir at Mandoli (Delhi NCR). But how to continue practising? With whom to converse? There are no SB's centres in north western Mumbai (Andheri area to be precise; there is a lot of SB activity in Mulund and Thane area but they are very far off for me for time and travel and cost).If i dont practice, i might forget what I have learnt, no? Kindly advise.You must have many people asking this question!  
Thnx and regards...Shreyas
