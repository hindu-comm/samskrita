Dear shrIkAnt,  
  
I think you have neglected one reason to study vyAkaraNa. (I myself started reading bits of laghu kaumudI only a few days ago; and I am not into kAvya at all.) It is its stunning beauty. If you are the kind of person who enjoys the sound of things neatly falling into place while reading Euclid or Newton, you will enjoy vyAkaraNa for its own sake.
