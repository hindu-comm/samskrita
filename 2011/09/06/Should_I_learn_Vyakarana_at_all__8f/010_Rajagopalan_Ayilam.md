Dear Srikanthji,  
  
When I started learning Sanskrit, I was also confused like you whether to go ahead with a detailed study of Grammar, or partial study focussing on other topics like kavya, alamkara etc. I studied Sanskrit at School level and was not in touch with the language for almost 13 years. My interested started again after reading a translation of Bhartruhari's neetishatakam. Then Kalidasa. Then I wanted to enjoy their works in original form, for which I started studying Vyakarana. There are also the beuty of Panini's work attracted me. But soon I realised that if want to master Vyakarna and then study Kalidasa and others, that will remain as dream only. As mentioned by Murthyji, I by hearted Sabdamanjari and Dhatumanjari and basics about Kararkas and few other basics. With the help of a Guru( I am forutunate to have a good one) I started reading Kalidasa's works. Initially it was very difficult. But with several "avruthi", I am now able to enjoy those Kavyas. After kalidasa I started Bharavi, Magha, some works on alamkara.....and I think the list goes on. Recently from this forum I got Bhallatashatakm and Subhashitaratnakosa, which I am yet to go through.  
  
So I think you need to decide what is that which is most attractive in Samskrit and work for that.
