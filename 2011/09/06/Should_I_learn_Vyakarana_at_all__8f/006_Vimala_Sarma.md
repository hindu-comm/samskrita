Dear Murthy Mahodaya and SriKanth Mahodaya,  
Yes but the derivation of stems from roots is not unique to Sanskrit as  
people with a background in comparative philology know (see ancient Greek,  
Latin etc) - like the Indologists who rendered Sanskrit grammar into  
Western concepts very accurately. Good starting places and references -  
MacDonell's grammar, Whitney's roots, Speijer's syntax.
