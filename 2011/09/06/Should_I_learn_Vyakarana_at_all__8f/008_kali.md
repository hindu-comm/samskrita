Hari OM!  
  
namaste ji\|  
  
As a Samskrita Bharati volunteer in Chennai, my humble suggestion in  
this regard is as follows :  
  
Yes, you need to study at least the basic grammar like Sandhi  
Prakaranam, Samasa Prakaranam, Krut TaddhitantaH, etc to augment your  
quest to proceed further. The simplest route is known to you  
already ! Continue with Samskrita Bharatis regular sikshana kendra  
Gita Sopana classes thru levels 1 to 3 or join and complete Prevsha  
thru Kovida both of which might take about two years to complete. The  
SB lessons are organized in a very simple and elegant way so as to  
keep the aspirant's enthu in place!  
  
best regards,  
kalivaradhan  
SB Chennai
