Dear Srikanth  
Even to read and understand properly Kavyas and Itihasa a good knowledge of  
grammar is necessary. What to say about "speaking Sanskrit flawlessly"?  
After years of learning grammar I cannot speak it naturally and stumble upon  
even basic simple sentences. This is because I am learning it relatively  
late in life.
