Respected Members,  
  
I started learning Sanskrit through Samskrita Bharathi and then  
started reading other Samskrit books, journals, magazines etc. I could  
fairly read and understand (though not been able to write properly  
yet) Samskirt.  
  
I think the next step for me is to start memorizing Amarakosa, Panini  
Sutrapata and then planning to get into Vyakarana. Is this correct  
route?  
  
As I look forward, I am boggled down by the enormity of Sanskrit  
Vyakarana and now I have started to think whether I really need to  
study Vyakarana at all. As it seems it would require several years of  
dedication and hardwork and a learned Guru (I have to search for her/  
him yet), which I am willing to do if its worth it.  
  
I have no intention to become a Pundit and write Samskrit poetry. The  
reason why I study Samskrit is to study, comprehend and enjoy Kavyas,  
Itihasa - Puranas, write and converse in Samskrit flawlessly. Is  
Vyakarana must for this?  
  
I feel like if I keep on reading simple sanskrit magazines like  
(chandamama, sudharma, rachana, sampratam, vaak, sambhashana sandesha  
etc), prabhanda - nibhanda, text books etc, I could get a fair grip of  
Samskrit without studying Vyakarana.  
  
What is the learned member's opinion on this. Please guide me.  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
