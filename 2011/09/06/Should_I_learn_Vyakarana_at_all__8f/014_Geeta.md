Dear Srikanth  
  
Check the lessons on this site <http://murthygss.tripod.com/samskrutasopanam_1.htm>. I think you will like it. It will take you toward your first goal of reading literature with the required emphasis on grammar. The exercises in Sanskrita Bharati's Geeta Sopanam and Bhasha Praveshah offer further practice and with their emphasis on spoken Sanskrit will take you to your second goal of speaking Sanskrit without effort. Another very useful site is [chitrapurmath.net](http://chitrapurmath.net).  
  
I have now completed half of Mr Murthy's lessons and have just started on Sanskrita Bharati's books. And am having a fantastic time. :)  
  
Best wishes  
Geeta
