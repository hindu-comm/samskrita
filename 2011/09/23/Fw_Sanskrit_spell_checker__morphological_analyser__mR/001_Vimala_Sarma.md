Amba –Ji

This looks very interesting.

What input is needed? Devanagari or Roman with diacritics?



Can this pick out Sanskrit words from a document with English texts and then check if it is written correctly with Roman diacritics such as:

“the Upanisads are the last sections of the vedas”.

Vimala
