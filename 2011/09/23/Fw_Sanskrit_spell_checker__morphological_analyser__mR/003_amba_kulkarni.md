Namaskar Pathak ji,  
  
The tool is a web service. It takes input only in Devanagari UTF-8.  
  
If you have a Linux Operating system on your machine, you can also  
install this system on your machine.  
  
Since Leap Software is Windows based, this tool does not work with  
Leap.  
  
Regards,  
Amba
