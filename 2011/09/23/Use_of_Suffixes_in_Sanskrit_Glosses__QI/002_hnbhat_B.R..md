Here is the available definitions for the different types of commentaries available in काव्यमीमांसा of राजशेखर:

  

सूत्राणां सकलसारविवरणं वृत्तिः \|  
सूत्रवृत्तिविवेचनं पद्धतिः \|  
आक्षिप्य भाषणाद्भाष्यम् \|  
अन्तर्भाष्यं समीक्षा \|  
अवान्तरार्थविच्छेदश्च सा \|  
यथासम्भवमर्थस्य टीकनं टीका \|  
विषमपदभञ्जिका पञ्जिका \|  
अर्थप्रदर्शकारिका कारिका \|  
उक्तानुक्तदुरुक्तचिन्ता वार्त्तिकमिति शास्त्रभेदाः \|

  

Some more categories are defined in Arthashastra. There is no strict division could be found in practice in the texts named as such. The other names as viveka, prakasha,

  

आत्मानात्मविवेकः, काव्यप्रकाशः, काव्यालंकारः, are part of the titles signifying the nature of their contents. If they are appended to any commentary, the same has to be taken. Just like, काव्यकल्पलताविवेकः, कल्पतरु-विवेकः etc.

It depends on the type of work it refers. Mm. Vimala has given the meanings in plain English and hence I am not translating the above sentences.

  

  

In respect of भाष्य, the only commentary prefixed with महत् - and not appended to anything else, is महाभाष्य of पतञ्जलि an elaborate commentary considered as the highest authority in Paninian system of Grammar. Even the भाष्य of पतञलि or पातञ्जल-भाष्य would not convey the meaning as महाभाष्य, it would convey only the commentary on योगसूत्र-s of पतञ्जलि. It is unique to महाभाश्य itself and not used in respect of any other commentary however great it may be.
