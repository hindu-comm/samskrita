Vimla,



 I have not one, but two copies. Hard copies. And that soft copy.



My impression:



It is indeed a translation. An absolutely mechanical one. As if done by a machine, word by word from with a walking-talking Sanskrit-English dictionary to hand!



The man himself is the first to admit to his incomprehension – in the second paragraph of the very first page – in the preface!

A Harvard professor!



His very use of ‘mind-stuff’ for example, for a simple term like citta, has fostered many a baffle-speak offspring!





Fortunately, there are a few around with buckets full of that, not so elusive ‘mind-stuff’.



Here’s just one, that’s better able to lead us out of the woods:

Also a Wood, Ernest Wood. An altogether easier read, much more insightful.



The pages of which, now somewhat yellowed, first led me to that not at all elusive clear-light conscious state being – literally so.



In a chapter headed ‘The Use of Sounds in Yoga Practice’, all thirty pages of it, we have among many others, a- u-m.

The operative word there, is ‘sound’. None of that incomprehensible philosophical ‘pure-mind’ baffle-speak stuff.



You should know where I’m coming from by now, but:



Not all philosophical matters are incomprehensible, its just that some are more annoying than others!

I can remember getting annoyed with a Mr Plato and his Republic, when reading his work as schoolboy of 14 – “What is he doing – his argument goes round in a circle – he’s moving the goalposts behind our [backs!” I would be wanting my money back, but it was a free library copy.]()



When I tried that mantra stuff of Woods’, attending the *sound itself* as it travelled from belly to brain, as it follows the changing pitch from a to mmm, a light grew in the head, literally, and simply, just like that.

A quantitative change at first, then on rare occasion, via that dark tunnel experience, a qualitative change into ‘pure mind stuff’. From white light, as in snow, to clear light, as in air. Unmistakable and unique.



Today, knowing of the electro-chemical nature of the neurons in the pink-stuff, the analogy is of the electric battery, as in an LED pocket torch etc. Viewed from the standpoint of battery as a container of the electrical energy. The flow of electrons cease when demand from of the LED diminished to zero.

Then, that which illuminates, stands.

Whereas, otherwise it flows.

Well it would, wouldn’t it!



Our battery is of course, one of them re-chargeable ones, and of variable capacity.

But even so, the energy, so stood, powers no LED, and might just as well not be there.

However, it is all harnessed up and ready to go – on demand.



More complicated devices, can all call upon the same source to power them.

Many are the electro-chemical devices in ‘pink-stuff’ to be so powered – or not, once properly harnessed.



As will be apparent, I have my work cut out restraining internal-organ-device, the first.



Our Ernest Wood, by the way, is also up there in cyber space. I have a copy around somewhere.



Eddie



PS.



 ‘electron’ is of course a concept, no less so than the concepts of old, but nevertheless, a useful one.
