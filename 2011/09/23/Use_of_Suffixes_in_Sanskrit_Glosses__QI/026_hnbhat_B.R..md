Dear Madam,

  

I think you have misplaced your response in the wrong thread. You are referring to the grammatical error of Patanjali in the YogasUtra-s, here it points out to the error of even Panini himself and presents Patanjali as the incarnation of शेष following the basis for of identification, as invoked by Panini himself.
