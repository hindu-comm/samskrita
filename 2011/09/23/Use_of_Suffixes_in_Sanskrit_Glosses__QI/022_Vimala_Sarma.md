Ajit Mahodaya

I do not know about where the grammatical error is or what is it but it is used by AB Keith as one reason for doubting that the that two are the same Patanjali.

Also here is some further thoughts on the matter, from the much-maligned Wiki, and the source of the traditional namaskarma or nandi for yoga is from a bhAshya from Bhoja's Rājamārttanda:

Whether the two works, the Yoga Sutras and the Mahābhāṣya, are by the same author has been the subject of considerable debate. The authorship of the two is first attributed to the same person in Bhojadeva's *Rajamartanda*, a relatively late (10th c.) commentary on the Yoga Sutras,^([\[4\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-3)) as well as several subsequent texts. As for the texts themselves, the [Yoga Sutra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutra "Yoga Sutra") iii.44 cites a sutra as that from Patanjali by name, but this line itself is not from the Mahābhāṣya. This 10th century legend of single-authorship is doubtful. The literary styles and contents of the Yogasūtras and the Mahābhāṣya are entirely different, and the only work on medicine attributed to Patañjali is lost. Sources of doubt include the lack of cross-references between the texts, and no mutual awareness of each other, unlike other cases of multiple works by (later) Sanskrit authors. Also, some elements in the Yoga Sutras may date from as late as the 4th c. CE,^([\[3\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-gavin-2)) but such changes may be due to divergent authorship, or due to later additions which are not atypical in the oral tradition. Most scholars refer to both works as "by Patanjali", without meaning that they are by the same author.

In addition to the Mahābhāṣya and Yoga Sūtras, the 11th-century commentary on [Caraka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caraka "Caraka") by the Bengali scholar Cakrapāṇidatta, and the 16th c. text *Patanjalicarita* ascribes to Patañjali a medical text called the *Carakapratisaṃskṛtaḥ* (now lost) which is apparently a revision (*pratisaṃskṛtaḥ*) of the medical treatise by Caraka. While there is a short treatise on yoga in the medical work called the Carakasaṃhitā (by Caraka), towards the end of the chapter called śārīrasthāna, it is notable for not bearing much resemblance to the Yogasūtras, and in fact presenting a form of eightfold yoga that is completely different from that laid out by Patañjali in the Yoga Sūtras and the commentary Yogasūtrabhāṣya.

The tradition that holds that all three works are by the same author is summed up in this verse from the beginning of Bhoja's Rājamārttanda commentary on the Yoga Sūtras:^([\[5\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-4))

yogena cittasya, padena vācāṃ, malaṃ śarīrasya ca vaidyakena ।  
yo'pākarot taṃ pravaraṃ munīnāṃ patañjaliṃ prāñjalir ānato'smi ॥

पतञ्जलिप्रार्थनं॥ योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैदिकेन । योपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि॥

English translation: I bow with my hands together to the eminent sage Patañjali, who removed the impurities of the mind through yoga, of speech through grammar, and of the body through medicine.



Further research, on the tradition of identifying Patanjali with Sesha or Anantha:

**Madurai and Chidambaram:**

**The Tamil Cities that Created Important Sanskrit Myths**

**by S. Palaniappan**

**May 1999**

**Introduction**

In his paper, "The Changing Notion of ziSTa from pataJjali to bhartRhari", (in "Bhartrhari: Philosopher and Grammarian" edited by Saroja Bhate and Johannes Bronkhorst, first published in 1993) M. M. Deshpande writes,

K. V. Abhyankar (1954:352) suggests that the southern grammarians knew the account of the transmission of the mahAbhASya and its recovery by candrAcArya from the south, and then they created the elaborate myths about pataJjali appearing in Chidambaram. However, this does not explain why pataJjali should have been regarded as an incarnation of zeSa, rather than some other divinity." (p.113 n.7)

In his later paper, "Who Inspired pANini? Reconstructing the Hindu and Buddhist Counter-Claims", JAOS, 117.3, 1997, Deshpande writes,

It would thus seem that the notion of pANini having been inspired by ziva may have developed in certain zaivite communities around the middle of the first millennium A.D. It was originally, in all likelihood, independent of the Chidambaram mythology associating ziva naTarAja with pataJjali incarnated as AdizeSa. David Dean Shulman (1980: 122ff.) discusses extensively the complex relationships of AdizeSa with various different south Indian zaivite shrines, most of which have little to do with his character as the grammarian pataJjali. In fact, I have a suspicion that bhartRhari, calling pataJjali AdiziSTa, may have been later \[mis\]understood as referring to AdizeSa." (p. 453)

Deshpande also acknowledges the interaction between the Tamil and Kashmir zaiva traditions in the spread of these myths. However, he seems to prefer Kashmir as the source of these myths.

In the Indology query, initiated by M. M. Deshpande to get early textual references to identifying pataJjali with AdizeSa, P.Magnone wrote on 20 Mar 95:

\> As for YS II,47, there indeed is a varia lectio ananta/aanantya; among

\> the commentators reading ananta, Vaacaspatimizra, VijJaanabhikzu,

\> Raghavaananda Sarasvatii, BhaavaagaNeza, NaagojiibhaTTa, Raamaananda and

\> Sadaazivendra Sarasvatii refer this to ZeSa, but they are all later than

\> KaiyaTa. ... they are all later than KaiyaTa except for Vaacaspati, of course.

Enrica Garzilli wrote,

Even though is likely that Patanjali of the YS is not the Patanjali of the Mahabhasya, (See e.g. A.B. Keith, Jacobi, onwards), the YS II, 47 explicitly mentions Ananta. It was interpreted by Vacaspatimisra (IX cent. A.D.) as Vasuki, teh mithological snake (brother of Sesa). (However Ananta is also the name of Sesa himself, the snake-god) . King Bhoja (IX cent.) read it as 'endeless', 'eternal'.

M. M. Deshpande concluded the discussion saying,

Thanks for the reference to Yoga-suutra II 47 which refers to Ananta. Though it is doubtful that the word refers to the snake divinity in the original suutra, one can see how a later commentator could take it as a proper name referring to the snake divinity. However, it is not clear how even this reference could have led to the identification of Patanjali as an incarnation of Shesha.

All these efforts to analyze the myths regarding pANini and pataJjali have not been fully successful. However, if one looks at the Tamil materials, literary and epigraphical, one can arrive at a better understanding of the history of these myths. There are different elements which have contributed to these myths. These include competition between zaivism and Jainism, competition between Pandyas of Madurai and the Pallavas/Cholas associated with Chidambaram, and competition between zaivism and vaiSNavism at Chidambaram, the telescoping of pataJjali of yogasUtra and pataJjali of mahAbhASya. But the fundamental factor seems to be the political and religious competition between Madurai and Chidambaram. This competition seems to be the motivating force behind the adoption of the myths linking pANini and pataJjali with ziva at Chidambaram. These myths were carried to the northern Sanskritic tradition through the medium of zaivism. In effect, the myth linking ziva and pANini was not independent of the Chidambaram mythology.



Sorry for such a long post.
