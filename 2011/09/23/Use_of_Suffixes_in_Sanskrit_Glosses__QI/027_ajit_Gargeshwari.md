Hi Eddie,

  

Philosophy is words and thoughts – anything goes – the more fanciful and imaginative the better.  

  

Probably in addition to The link Vimaji has sent you must also read the books I had given in " use of Suffixes in Sanskrit Glosses"

Anything and everything one writes from imagination is called poetry and not Philosophy. Yoga has robust strong, a highly developed and complete system of philosophy.  

  

Those unburdened by such a weight of received wisdom, find it easy to detect the vast difference between the nature of the works such the Saṃkhya and those such as the YS.

  

"Yoga and Sankhya", Mimamsa and vedanta " and "Nyaya and Vaisheshika" are Samnan Tantra.

  

Yoga system by and large accepts the basic tenants of Sankhya.

Both are dualist systems though scholars differ in detail details. You can read Dr. Anima Senguptas works on Sankhya to undersatnd the close relation between Sankhya an Vedanta. The yogic School of thought accept Purusha and Prakrita the Sankhya cocept of Evolution, The primary epistemological, Ontological position of Samkhya system of thought.  

  

All the evidence is that the YS are simple instructions, but the manner in which they are given, in what was manifestly everyday words of the time – technical terms are carefully explained – the same in everyday words. Nothing the least bit esoteric – at the time.   

  

Yogic Asasnas are a part of Hatha yoga which is popular among masses and is just one limb of Astanga yoga. So do not confuse between Asanas which are only the third step with the philosophy of Sankhya and Yoga  

  

Patanjali and all subsequent commentators and scholars have discussed the philosophy of Yoga

  

Yoga is not a Manual for where common everyday words are used. Every word in Yoga Sutra is used in a highly Technical and Philosophical sense.

  

I f you Have Dr. Rukmini's translation in four Volume that you have said you have it with you it will be clear.

  

Yoga mixed with Tantrik doctrines written in popular language may have many esoteric doctrines. Tantrik and Budhists are very old systems of thought and have profound and deep philosophy in them.  

  

  

The wondrous properties of the Soma juice for example is extolled over and over again in the writings,   

  

Can you give me any one quotation from any of the traditional commentators of Yogas Sutra where the writers talks about Soma Juice.

  

The earliest and most reliable ‘copies’ in India, are hardly a few centuries old!  

  

  

You Can go through the list manuscripts held at different Oriental libraries across India and Europe to get old and authentic manuscripts.

  

Regards
