Ajit,







 2,000 years of history have indeed linked and associated the YS with the Saṃkaraḥ – in the minds of those endlessly subjected to such teachings.



Those unburdened by such a weight of received wisdom, find it easy to detect the vast difference between the nature of the works such the Saṃkhya and those such as the YS.

To many, it is quite apparent that the YS is no more a philosophical work, than is the āyur-vedas.



Philosophy is words and thoughts – anything goes – the more fanciful and imaginative the better.

Not so with medicine and disease. Authentic copies of prescriptions are vital.



Likewise with the YS – something you do. Where again, authentic instructions are vital, otherwise incomprehensible and meaningless.



The earliest and most reliable ‘copies’ in India, are hardly a few centuries old! Trade routes, vastly older.



It is clear that I am drawing a blank here. It could be, of course, that my question is not understood, through being badly expressed.

However, the awareness of the YS as being somewhat other than philosophy has long been around out in the world at large, along with its rightful interpretation.



All the evidence is that the YS are simple instructions, but the manner in which they are given, in what was manifestly everyday words of the time – technical terms are carefully explained – the same in everyday words. Nothing the least bit esoteric – at the time. The words on your papers, however, that exist side by side in the present, and so associated in the mind of the reader, are actually as different as centuries of time, geographical divide, and great cultural differences can make them.



The wondrous properties of the Soma juice for example is extolled over and over again in the writings, - when to collect it under the moonlight, how to partake of it etc. etc. etc. Alexandra the Great speaks of it! Unfortunately, the whole heap of paper is useless,. In practice, a vital piece of information is missing. The absence of a glass of Soma juice is far to serious a matter to be handed over to philosophers – real people don’t have 2,000 years to wait!



I’ll just have to make some more saṃyāma, then I suppose.



Eddie
