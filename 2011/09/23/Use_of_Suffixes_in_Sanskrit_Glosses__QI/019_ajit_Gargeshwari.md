Hi Eddie  
  
  

"The application of a bit of technology such as reverse engineering, i.e. determining what (hard) problem a given (soft) solution was designed to solve, can be quite revealing. "  
  

I do not understand what reverse engineering you are talking about in determining textual problems. (When reverse engineering is tough for a simple product available in market ). Please keep in mind Yoga sutras has more than 2,000 years of history and is closely linked and associated with Snakhya School of thoughts.  
Even the Great Shankarcharya ascribed to have lived in the 8 century considers sankyhya to be a Prdahana Malla.  
  
Artha Shastra uses the word Yoga a which is an even earlier text.

  
  
However, I have not come across a 57 sūtra version, but it would be instructive to chart the recensions. I am ready to believe that the most original editions extant may well be in Arabic, or Chinese, Persian even. Research these days, is multi-national and inter-disciplined.  
  

Please understand when you one is taking about an ancient text such as Yoga Sutras I do not know about the reliability of Arabic, or Chinese, Persian even etc. I would prefer to use contemporary traditions of thoughts that existed at that time.  
  
Technology may give you access to manuscripts how do you determine the manuscripts age by a scanned copy !!!!. One will have to understand the background of the manuscript to determine its reliability ( Like the place of origin the type quality scripts used etc). Do you have access to all copies of Yoga sutra manuscripts in a scanned format??  
  
Many old manuscripts are written in different ancient scripts and not necessarily Devanagari  
  
With this note Eddie, I want you to give me Ten reliable and concrete proof about the number of sutras in Vibhuti pada. If you are only dependent on Dr Rukminis texts( with due respect to the learned author) you get a view point of Vivarna tradition only. There are other traditions for the interpretation and of Yoga sutras including Oral traditions.  
  
  
  
Please click on the below links that will help to understand the complexity of the question involved. as far as as research is concerened a critical edition on the first pada is available.
