Vimalaji,  
a traditional verse says  
योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैदिकेन ।  
योपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि॥

  
  
Scholars came to this conclusion because some of the grammar rules were broken in YogasUtra!  
  

No rules of Grammar are broken in Yoga sutras  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali>  
  
Gives some information about Patanjali  
  
Dasgupta has written a book a study of Patanjali in which he talks about three Patanjali's. ( Its available at [archive.org](http://archive.org))

All book is available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). None of these books or authors says Grammar rules were not broken, but Scholars assign different reasons for assigning the time of composition of Mahabhashya and Yoga sutra  
  
Even Scholars such as Jan gonda Volume 6 part 3 while discussing about dates of YS do not talk about incorrect Grammar in yoga sutras ( the book is available [sribd.com](http://sribd.com) for a download)  
  
A sutra is defined as  
*alpākṣaraṃ asandigdhaṃ sāravad viśvatomukham  
astobhaṃ anavadyaṃ ca sūtram sūtravido viduḥ  
  
If a composition is said to be a sutra it has to be flaless at least in terms of Grammar
