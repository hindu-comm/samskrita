Thanks for the comments. I could not remember any deviation from Paninian Grammar in the Sutra-s. Even if it is against, explicitly, identifying him, with the Grammarian, Patanjali had modified and deleted many rules of Panini. One cannot so easily identify without swarming through out his महाभाष्य.

  

I myself for the one, who do not believe in their being identical for many other reasons offered by historians of Sanskrit Literature. It is the common belief that identified both as one in the tradition which culminated in the following verse:

  

योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य तु वैद्यकेन।

योऽपाकरोत् तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोऽस्मि॥

  

very often quoted verse identifying the three Patanjali's, not two (including Caraka-patanjali, the compiler of चरकसंहिता in आयुर्वेद ).
