This is the verse quoted byBhoja's Rājamārttanda Varttika on the Yoga Sūtras in the beginning. The identification is debated among the scholars and it has been said the identification of the three as one, is based on the South Indian Tradition of Chidambaram reference in the Tamil Shaivite and Vaishnavite religious Works as the incarnation of Sheha.

  

The works listed by Ajit Gargeswari can be consulted for the discussions. There are some more references in the Vikipedia article also on this topic.
