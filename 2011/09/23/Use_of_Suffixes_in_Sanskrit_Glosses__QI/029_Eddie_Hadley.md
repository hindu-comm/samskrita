Ajit,



I have a request for details of the Yoga Sutra Vibhūti pāda with 57 Sutra.



I would like to get my hands on the particular work that you so kindly listed in the Forum, for us members.



A hard copy or a soft copy will do.



I have had a good look on the internet for the item:

“Yoga Sutra Vritti published by Vani Vilas Press as number11

in their Shasra series has 57 sutras in Vibhūti pāda”



But without success.



As the person who listed the item, perhaps you can provide the details where it be found.

Of course, If you no longer have them to hand, please don’t take any trouble over it.



Can anyone help me out here, please.





Thanks,



 Eddie
