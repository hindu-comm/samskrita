Ajit,



“No rules of Grammar are broken in Yoga sutras”  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali>  



Not a criminal offence, perhaps, but what about breaking the YS themselves!



 The assertion that there are 56 sūtra to the Vibhūti pāda, puts doubt as to the reliability of the contributors of the article.

There are 55, not 56.

The mistake comes from a scribe, taking the final line from Vyāsa’s commentary on III. 21

viz. *Etena śabdādi-antardhānam uktam veditavyam,* and attributing it to Patañjali.

 Reverse engineering can help rehabilitate the criminals!

The application of a bit of technology such as reverse engineering, i.e. determining what (hard) problem a given (soft) solution was designed to solve, can be quite revealing.



‘Reverse engineering’ is dignified computer-speak for the process of documenting a project – after the project is finished, and the original ‘software engineers’ have long gone. Its not an easy task. Often the original engineers never fully understand their own solutions. Developments of all kinds, involve a great deal of good old fashioned trial-and-error.

The understanding only ever comes after the solution is discovered, how could it be otherwise!



Water flows downhill. Yes, but why? ‘Gravity’, whatever that is, could just as well push water uphill. That is not understood, but it always works that way when I turn the tap!
