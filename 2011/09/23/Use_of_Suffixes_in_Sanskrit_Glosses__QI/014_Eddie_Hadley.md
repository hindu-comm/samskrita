Ajit,



 Facts can be inconvenient at times, but the evidence is there for all to see for themselves - Vyāsa does comment on III. 21, that:

 *Etena śabdādi-antardhānam uktam veditavyam.*



 No great critical powers are required to declare that the particular edition(s) in question is not ‘a critical edition’. Anybody, can see that.

More to the point, it shows that these publishers, authors, government authorities, etc. etc. are hardly to be relied on as Authoritive sources.



A few of these works, are indeed thoughtful productions, as are some of their readers.

My information came from two sources, the first, a publication that simply drew attention to the fact of there being 55/56 sūtra versions. The second from a member of a forum (long ago) whose posting provided the additional information about Vyāsa.



However, I have not come across a 57 sūtra version, but it would be instructive to chart the recensions. I am ready to believe that the most original editions extant may well be in Arabic, or Chinese, Persian even. Research these days, is multi-national and inter-disciplined.



To quote your source, Wiki, where the information is only as unreliable as the last person who takes it upon himself to update the page, it is a matter of determining ‘the original’.



“The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work *is the production of a "critical edition" containing a text most closely approximating the original*.”





Wiki:



Ancient scribes made errors or alterations when copying manuscripts by hand.

Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic seeks to reconstruct the original text (the archetype or autograph) as closely as possible.

The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate editions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history.



The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work *is the production of a "critical edition" containing a text most closely approximating the original*.





And beyond that, there’s the small problem of determining how much the author himself understands of what he writes about. It is that understanding that matters, not who or when, where and in what country, the stuff was written.



Anyway, a lot of water is passed, over the millennia. And for a subject such of this one - the same world common to all, the ultimate teacher, common sense, is as ever, always available for a second opinion.



In addition to others, I now have T.S Rukmani’s four volumes, which is the most more modern I have. She gives 55, and provides both parts of the information.



But as to 57?



Eddie
