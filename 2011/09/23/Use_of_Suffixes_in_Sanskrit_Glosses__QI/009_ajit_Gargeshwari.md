Hi Eddie  
  

The assertion that there are 56 sūtra to the Vibhūti pāda, puts doubt as to the reliability of the contributors of the article.

There are 55, not 56.  
  

I do not know if Yoga Sutras of Patanjali has a critical edition  

  

-   Yoga Sutra Vritti published by Vani Vilas Press Number as number11
    in their Shasra series has 57 sutras in Vibhūti pāda -   Paatanjala Yoga published Anand Ashram sanskrit series volume47 has
    55 sutras in Vibhūti pāda -   Science of yoga By I.K. Taimni has 56 sutras in Vibhūti pāda -   The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Translated by Rama Prasad inSacred
    books of the Hindus Volume 4 has 54 sutras in Vibhūti pāda -   Yoga System of Patanjali edited and translated by J HWoods in HOS
    Volume 17 has 55 sutras in Vibhūti pāda -   Paatanjala yoga sutra bhashya vivarnam published in Madras Goverment
    oriental series has 55 in Vibhūti pāda -   Paatanjala yoga darshnam published by Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan has
