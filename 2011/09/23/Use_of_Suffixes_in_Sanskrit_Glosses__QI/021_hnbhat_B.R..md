Sorry madam,

  

Hope this will be readable.

I didn't type it, but only it is image of the relevant section from the
page of the scanned book.

  

The last paragraph justifies their difference as the author of YogasUtra was earlier than Panini, as Panini refered to पाराशर्यसूत्र (ब्रह्मसूत्र) which in turn refers to "Yoga-\[sutra?\]" of पतञ्जलि.

  

By the way as he has mentioned, I too could not locate the verse attributed to Bhoja's Rajamartanda-vArtika (in the Vikipedia article) which identifies the three as one in the published Edition available with me. Here it is not confirmed as to which work he has quoted, may possibly in his सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण (व्याकरण), but could not be confirmed.
