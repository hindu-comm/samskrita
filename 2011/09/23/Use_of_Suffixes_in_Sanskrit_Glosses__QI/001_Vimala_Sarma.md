Dear Bala Mahodaya

The different endings for works refer to different classes of literature – it has nothing to do with depth but with what is being written –they do not all refer to commentaries.

bhāṣya –commentary (explaining some existing work)

vārtika,- usually a critique putting forward a view contrary to what is being criticized;

tīkā, - not sure about this

prakāśa, - notes explaining for example, directions for actors saying particular lines

rahasya, - some obscure or secret meaning, taking more than what is said in the text.

māla, - usually a list of something or a compilation of like things

vṛtti, - events, happenings?

kārika, - composed verses or a new work

prakāśika – notes going with sUtras for instruction to student etc ?

patrikā, - letter, newspaper?

viveka, - distinctions, discernment, showing differences in meaning

alaṅkāra –elaboration and decoration, aesthetics.
