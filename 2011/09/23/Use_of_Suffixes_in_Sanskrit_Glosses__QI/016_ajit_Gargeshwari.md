Hi Eddie,

  
  
To quote your source, Wiki, where the information is only as unreliable as the last person who takes it upon himself to update the page, i

t is a matter of determining ‘the original’.  
  
Dr T.S Rukmani’s has not claimed that the edition printed is a critical text.  
  
  
Wiki or a book or a any research paper remains a source to know a view point of the author. Till a critical edition is is published and reasons assigned by the editor is accepted 55/56/ 57 remains open.  
  
To chart recessions one needs to go through several manuscripts sort them to groups and for a Vulgate version has to be done...........etc. I totally agree with you.  
  
If you are reading printed editions without reading Manuscripts spread across different Manuscript library then you may not be able correctly fix the number of sutras. This is my opinion.  
  

Ancient scribes made errors or alterations when copying manuscripts by hand.  
  

A critical edition can answer .  
  
My source of knowledge is confined to printed books alone.  
  
My answer pertained to Grammatical errors in the Yoga Sutra ( I mean on Sutras excluding Bhshyas etc.). A Sutra can never be Grammatically incorrect. Even a Vartikakara while writing about ukta, anukta and durukta on a Bhashaya never says a sutra is Grammatically incorrect. I have also referred to standard texts covering various aspects of Indian Philosophical systems to substantiate my answer
