Ajit,



“Dr T.S Rukmani’s has not claimed that the edition printed is a critical text.”



Indeed she hasn’t, and neither has Eddie claimed that Rukmani's has claimed that the edition printed is a critical text.

What Eddie did do, was ask a simple question about variety number 57.



Critical text or not, the good lady does build up on previous knowledge regarding variations, and researches the material, to determine the authenticity.

In other words she traces the source of the errors in transcription, and passes on her findings to her good readers.

As such, such publications add to the sum of knowledge, rather than just reproduce old findings.



Anyway, what you have to say about comparing manuscripts, takes a bit more than just reading.

Such manuscripts are increasingly available in their scanned versions, these days, ready for perusal by fresh minds.



When I tell you that I have seen a headmaster (my own cousin), teach a class of pupils, that you can only castle the Queen from one side of the chessboard, you will understand that such handed down teachings have scope for a little confusion down the line. And you will surely be aware of a certain translation from Hebrew into Greek, whereby ‘maiden’ – simply an unmarried women - became ‘virgin’, and remained so at the time of a famous birth, even. The consequence of that innocent scribes event, shapes the geography of nations, even today.



However, I’m not an historian, but a systems analyst by profession, and probably by nature, so specifically, do you have access to the version with the 57 varieties? What specifically does that version say, what are that differences. Which version most closely reflects the original system? Or has nobody bothered yet?

I can understand, that there are many that find these matters, rather dull in comparison to the narratives, but you must admit it does have its interesting side. Not to mention being a legitimate concern.





Eddie.
