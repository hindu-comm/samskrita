नमस्ते ।

To all the learned members of the forum:



In searching for Sanskrit commentaries and glosses, I have come across the following suffixes. I suspect there could be more. I would like to know if there are any strict rules to be followed in using these tags, or are they just arbitrarily used by the authors? Could one judge the intensity and the depth of the gloss from the suffix?

भाष्य, वार्तिक, प्रकाश, रहस्य, माल, वृत्ति, कारिक, प्रकाशिक, पत्रिका, टीका, विवेक, अलङ्कार. (bhāṣya, vārtika, tīkā, prakāśa, rahasya, māla, vṛtti, kārika, prakāśika, patrikā, ṭīkā, viveka, and alaṅkāra).



धन्यवादः

Bala
