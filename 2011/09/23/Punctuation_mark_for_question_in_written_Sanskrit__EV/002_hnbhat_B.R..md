I agree with Mr. Ramakrishnan. The punctuation is an orthographic convention used in the written language to make the sentence clear while it is done with intonation in spoken language. In written documents of Sanskrit in palmleaf, barch etc. no other marks than ones to indicate the end of a sentence or a verse are used. That too in many cases will have to be guessed by reading the sentence. In modern convention of writing, all the punctuation marks available in other languages can also be used for writing/printing Sanskrit if it makes clear the meaning. I am using all the possible punctuation marks available in English in addition to a "danda" which is native in Devanagari orthography.

  

There are interrogatives, exclamations (either words/phrases), rhetoric questions, emphatic/affirmative/negative implications by change of tone in spoken language. All these could be inferred in the absence of any punctuation mark or could be easily understood while reading by any one provided they do not interfere with the meaning. In verses, punctuation marks may hinder the reciting of them, but in prose they could be conveniently employed. I could not see anything beyond this in the above cited examples.
