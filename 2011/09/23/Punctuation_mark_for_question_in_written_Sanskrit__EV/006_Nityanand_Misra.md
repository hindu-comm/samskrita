Avagraha in current day Devanagari shows what is called अकारप्रश्लेष (coalescence of the vowel 'a'). What is अतिप्राचीन is the sandhi rules which mandate अकारप्रश्लेष, rather than the practice of indicating अकारप्रश्लेष by an avagraha sign. Bear in mind that Upanishads are older but Devnagari only dates from 8th century AD, so one cannot conclude that usage of avagrahas is ancient since it is seen in current day renderings of ancient Upanishads in Devanagari.  
  
The question is still valid, when did the usage of avagraha sign begin to show a leftover 'a'? To answer this, one must explore if the avagraha sign or its equivalent is present in pre-Devanagari scripts like Gupta-script or Brahmi-script.
