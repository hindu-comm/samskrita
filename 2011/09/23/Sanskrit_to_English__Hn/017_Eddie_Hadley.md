Anunad,



 Those scripts that you have copied from somewhere, have an entirely different purpose.

 They are designed to be used from a server.



 Embedding scripts into a web pages for users to use in local mode, requires a somewhat different procedure.

 There are many free online tutorials to tell how.

 But . . . that’s old technology - embedding scripts into web pages is an especially unsafe way to go, in this day and age.

 As it happens, the presence or absence of those three scripts, makes absolutely no difference – they never get invoked.

 I have tested your html, with and without them.

 They might just as well never be there.

 Members will be relieved to know that by pure chance, they do no harm.



 Using unsuspecting users, as Guinea pigs is irresponsible at best.

 And nowadays, the way to go is by managed code i.e. with Microsoft .NET packages.



 Anyway, there have long been plenty of very capable packages to be had for free, simply by the looking.



 Eddie
