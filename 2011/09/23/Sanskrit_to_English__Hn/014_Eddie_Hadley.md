Anunad,



 Some feedback.



 “Please find attached 'Sanskrit transliterator' as a single html file. This can be used offline.”  

 Offline?

 All web pages are ‘offline’ once its link has been clicked and they download!

 You could just as well have included those references in your post!



 Anyone wanting to work offline only has to Google for ‘offline sanskrit transliteration’ and take their pick!

 Plenty of advice and comparisons for the unadventurous.



 Check out the likes of the venerable Itranslator:

 Anunad, the ones you list are very much online, viz. [Google Indic transliteration](http://www.google.com/transliterate/indic) and ‘this picker’:



 Sanskrit transliterator.html is just a short web page of URL’s – to online sites!

 Mostly Wiki pages - even see ‘these instructions’ is a Wiki page.

 ‘this page’ gives a 404 error.



 For what its worth, the –online- [Google Indic transliteration](http://www.google.com/transliterate/indic) and ‘this picker’ sites do work just fine with IE.9 under Windows 7 Home Premium, when JavaScript is enabled.
