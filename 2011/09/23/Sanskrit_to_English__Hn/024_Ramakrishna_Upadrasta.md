namaste to followers of this thread:

It seems that the main question is for an \*offline\* script that  
converts from ITRANS to devanaagari. The following perl script written  
by Shri Pankaj Gupta is simply an excellent one.

Itrans to unicode Devanagari using Perl ! A Perl script  
[itrans2html.pl](http://itrans2html.pl) written by Pankaj Gupta to convert Itrans text to html  
containing unicode Devanagari for Linux/Unix command line conversion.  
(Rename from itrans2html_pl.txt [itrans2html.pl](http://itrans2html.pl) for implementation.) It  
can be used on windows machine using Cygwin. The benefit of this  
script is offline use, and ability that the user can easily customize  
it. This script would work on very big texts that cannot be submitted  
for conversion via a browser, and is very fast in general. For  
example, it takes about 40-50 seconds to convert 166,000 lines in  
whole of Mahabharat itrans text. The output of entire Mahabharat,  
encoded in HTML Unicode Devanagri is about 40 megs. Please provide  
suggestions (email [sans...@cheerful.com]()) for improvements or feel  
free to implement additional features.

I have modified the above script of Shri Pankaj Gupta to do "stuff"  
for the mailing lists I run (like automatically select texts, send  
mails to subscribers of the groups, etc.). One can have a look at the  
mails of the following lists to see how excellently the script runs.

<http://groups.google.com/group/gita-anvaya-sandhi-vigraha>

I use a linux machine do to the above, but I think the above  
conversion can be done on a WIndows machine with CYGWIN installed as  
well. But most importantly, I agree that doing any of these needs some  
expertise of UNIX and perl.

Hope it helps!  
namaste
