 JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace from [JavaScript](http://www.crockford.com/javascript) files.

> It typically reduces filesize by half, resulting in faster downloads.



. . . faster downloads, like, as from a SERVER, perhaps?



In plain English:

 Not only the 992 lines of script but the entire .html does nothing whatsoever.

 It only a bunch of URL’s, what it actually does in a roundabout 1,000 line way is link to a couple of web sites.

 Look! one click – one line.[Viola!

Thankfully, nothing whatsoever is offline on users PC.



You do understand the ‘Thankfully‘bit, don’t you!
