Eddie Hadley mahodayaH,  
  
Do you mean following three lines (statements) are redundant for offline use?  
  
\<script type="text/javascript" charset=UTF-8 src="json2.js">\</script>  
\<script type="text/javascript" charset=UTF-8 src="convert-data-sa.js">\</script>  
\<script type="text/javascript" charset=UTF-8 src="convert-in.js">\</script>  
  
Then I do not see the statements which are responsible for all the great conversions in this 'small' html file? I tested the program with these three lines and without. It works with but not without (It looks strange to me).  
  
Can you (or somebody else) explain the real purpose of these lines?
