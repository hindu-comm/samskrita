Good Question. Panini has compiled all his concepts in his अष्टाध्यायी. K V Abhyankar had listed them in his Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, a link for it was posted here long ago. There are many other technical terms Panini borrows from already designated by earlier grammarians and the commentaries, say पूर्वाचार्याणां संज्ञा.

  

For example, वर्णसमाम्नाय and अक्षरसमाम्नाय are equivalents and Patanjali takes them as synonyms as designated by earlier Grammarians. "वर्णं वाप्यक्षरं प्राहुः" in the प्रत्याहाराह्निक, by पूर्वाचार्याणां वर्णस्य अक्षरमिति संज्ञा। There are many others you can come across, as you go on progressively with SK.

  
Thanks for your effort of building a new reference manual.
