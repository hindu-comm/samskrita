Thanks for the information. Very nice work done by Pushpadi DikShit who had been organizing VyakaraNa classes regularly or periodically divided in convenient sessions.

  

Broadly the content is in the following order:

  

1 Chapter is devoted to generally संज्ञा-सूत्र-s. Those not covered in this chapter are scattered and pronounced before the immediately relevant सूत्र as and when required. This chapter is combined with परिभाषा-s.

  

2\. Chapter is devoted to समास listing and operations in General classification .

  

3\. Chapter is devoted to verbal primary derivations - conjugations and participles

  

4 -5. Chapter is devoted to feminine forming suffixes up to 4.1.76 and the rest of 4th chapter and 5th Chapter devoted to तद्धित suffixes and समासान्त suffixes included in them at the end of 5th Chapter.

  

6\. Chapter devoted to Sandhi (svara-sandhi) in the first Paada and accent regulations and certain stem formations अङ्ग before certain suffixes like duplication, modification etc, अलुक् etc .

  

7\. Chapter also continues with modifications to the stem before suffixes.

  

8\. Chapter takes up another duplication operation in the first chapter and continues up to 1st Pada. and has an important Sutra befinning the 2nd paada.8-2-1 पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् । after which also many operations are prescribed. Here appears many consonant sandhi-s again after regulations of स्वर, this time to consonants in Sandhi.



This is the general outlay view of Ashtadhyayi at a glance. Detailed contents can be seen in the Dictionary of Paninian Grammar. or in the Book by Pushpa Dikshit.
