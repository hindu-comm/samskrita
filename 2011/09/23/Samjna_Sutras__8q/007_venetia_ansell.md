Namo namaH



Thank you all very much for your comments. As I see it there are several issues at play here:



1. What exactly do we mean by a saMjnA-sUtra?



When I was creating this list I realised that this questoinwas much more complex than I had originally thought. In some cases, it is clear that Panini is defining his terms - for instance'bha' (yaci bham) or vRddhi (vRddhirAdaic). In other cases, though, I couildn't decide whether he is defining a term or simply applying a term to a set of words (if we can make such a distinction), for instance with the samAsa categories, where he simply says this sutra and the following sutras up until x point are called 'tatpuruSa' etc. There are also seeming inconsistencies, such as that of kRt and taddhita. kRt seems to be defined by the sutrakRdatin while taddhita is more like the samasa sutras in that a single sutra (taddhitAH) tells you that the following sutras are all mandating taddhita suffixes.

What I tried to do in this list is cover theterms that it is useful to know when starting to learn vyakarana. However, I didn't include the many terms that Panini does not define in sutra form (such as lakAra or pratyaya) simply for lack of time.



2. Other concepts/terms



I also found that there are several terms or concepts which were not glossed as saMjnAs by the commentators but which seemed to me to fit the bill. For instance, ekashruti.



3. SaMjnA-prakaraNa



As someone has pointed out in the email exchange above, while commentators do divide up parts of the Asthadhyayi into saMjnA-prakaraNa etc, this is not something that Panini did. Moreover, I find that while many of the samjnas do fit into the first part of 1.1 and other sections that are termed as samjna prakaranas (I think there is another one in 1.4 for instance), there are other floating samjnas which are introduced before that particular term is used, as with the term abhyAsa.



4. Siddhanta Kaumudi



I have been through the SK saMjnA chapter and find that it is not, as you might suppose, a list of all saMjnAs in the Asthadhyayi, but rather a collection of important sutras used to form pratyAhAras and so on, plus some of the saMjnA sUtras. In fact it was after reading this SK chapter that I realised I needed a complete list of saMjnAs to help me with my own study and as one didn't seem to be available, I attempted to create it.



SL Abhyankar mahodaya asked the following question:"एकतानता", "समत्वम्" एताविधाः "ता-" अथवा "त्व"-प्रत्ययात्मकाः संज्ञाः भाववाचकाः । एतेषां न कश्चिदुल्लेखः भवत्याः संकलने । कथमेतत् ? नास्ति किञ्चित् सूत्रं एतद्विषये ?

If you could let me know the saMjnA sUtras for tA and tva (are they known by a collective term rather sat refers to shatR and shAnavac?) I would gladly include them.





The book Vidya-mahodayaa mentioned sounds very useful and I will try to get it from Aksharam if it is available there.





If anyone would like the document in Word format to be able to copy and paste it, just let me know.





Thank you again for your comments, all of which are of great use in helping me understand the Asthadhyayi.



Best,

Venetia
