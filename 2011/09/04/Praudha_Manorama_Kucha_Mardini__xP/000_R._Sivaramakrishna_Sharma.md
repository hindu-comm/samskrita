Namaste All,  
  
I'm a new member to this Group. I am looking for a book entitled  
"Praudhamanorama Kucha Mardini" also sometimes known as "Manorama  
Kucha Mardini" of Panditaraja Jagannatha.  
  
Has this work been published ? If so is there any online version of  
this book. If there is no online version (scanned copy) of this book  
any details of availability (publisher etc.) would be appreciated.  
  
Thank you.  
  
R. Sivaramakrishna Sharma
