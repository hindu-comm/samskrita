Namaste,

My understanding of this is that because aNuditsavarNasya cApratyaya, which tells us that aN (aiuN to laN) can be used to refer to its own form (svarUpa)as well as its savarNas, comes afternAjjhalau we have to assume that the ac in nAjjhalau refers only to a-i-u-R-L-e-o-ai-au and not to the dIrgha, pluta, anunAsika, niranunAsika, udAtta, anudAtta and svarita forms of these svaras. If that is the case then the ac in nAjjhalau doesn't include dIrgha akAra and we would then have a problem because AkAra and hakAra would be savarNa.

This would lead to situations like:

vishvapA + bhis

vishvap + Dha + bhis (by ho DhaH)

which are aniSTa-rUpams (non-desirable forms). Thus in the Kaumudi, the sutra is split to include AkAra (na + A + ac + halau) to avoid this problem.

However, as far as I can see we still have a problem with IkAra+ shakAra and RRkAra (dIrgha RkAra) + SakAra where savarNatvam is not prevented by nAjjhalau. I'd be grateful if anyone could explain this aspect of it.

Best,

Venetia
