Maybe a digression from the topic, but what you mentioned below is what we have been programmed to believe by our system. But is it not ironical that Indian lawmakers of 1940s took nothing from Manu, Yajnavalkya, Chanakya or Apastambha and just copied from English, German, French and American law?  
  
Particularly on this point, I do think it is justified to have a higher punishment for people with higher status since the masses do follow the examples of people in power or higher positions -  
  
यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः ।  
स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते ॥
