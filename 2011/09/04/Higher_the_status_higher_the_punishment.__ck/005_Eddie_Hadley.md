Philosopher P.K.,



 As a philosophical question, much can be said, but given the context, some ‘definitions’, please.

It is necessary to define ‘crime’, ‘punishment’ ‘status’ etc. etc. before even beginning to debate such issues.

For example, here is but one definition of crime, whereby the great are judged not only on what they do, but what they don’t do . . ..



* crime, n.*

* 1. an action or an instance of negligence that is deemed injurious to the public welfare or morals or to the interests of the state and that is legally prohibited.*



Each case to be individually judged on its particular circumstances, and merits balanced against demerits.

. . . and in the meantime, the accused should show public spirit, and place themselves under house arrest while the matter is being resolved . . .

But surely, ‘the way forward’ seen by those possessed of ‘great vision’ is better to be decided upon, by other than by poetic means.



The man deserves a X on the ballot sheet.



Eddie
