Vimalaji,



I disagree with you. There are 2-3 reasons:

1. If a minister is corrupt then all below him are going to be corrupt as they can sight his example. Recently Justice Sen did this by saying “I am being singled out but most politicians are corrupt.”

2. The policy impact of a national leader is far more than regional leader. So PM Manmohan Singh should get harsh punishment than the mayor of the city I live as the corruption happening under PM is impacting the whole nation.
