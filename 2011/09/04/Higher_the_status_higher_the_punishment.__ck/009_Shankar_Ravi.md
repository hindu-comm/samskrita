The smritis are social norms and practices established through experience of society and life. The relevance of such norms, as well as their implementation should be approached with caution and respect.
While it is important to understand the underlying value of a norm, believing and implementing without understanding might be much detrimental to the very practice of the tradition, possibly doing more harm. I refrain from providing examples only to avoid much debate.
However, i do believe in the revival of Sanskrit as a language for all, not only for the preservation of scripture but also the renaissance of one great faith for the modern age. We need law givers like Manu, Yagnavalkya, and parashara for the new millennium.  
  
Dhanyavaadaha,  
  
Shankara.
