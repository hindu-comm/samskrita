I got forwarded to me a message from a person for a sloka justifying higher punishment for a person of a higher status for the same offence.
It seems the

leader of opposition in the Parliament wanted some such thing. I have given him

the following sloka-

  

यथा वृक्षान् विनिपति

न तृणं चण्डमारुत: /

दण्डयेत् पौरमुख्यान् वै

तीव्रमल्पं तथापरान् //

--अभिनवचाणक्य:



Just as the storm fells the trees

to the ground but not the grass,

eminent people should be punished

severely (for their crimes) but the

people of lower rungs should be

punished mildly.



Comments on the above are welcome.
