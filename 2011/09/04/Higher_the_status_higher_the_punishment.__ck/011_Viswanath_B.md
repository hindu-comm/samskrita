All men (and women) are equal under the law.  
  

I believe this statement is true only for declaring somebody a culprit. Where as the referred shloka talks about how for the same offense, the punishment is different.  
  
Even today, Judges are empowered, with in the ambit of law, to handout
varying levels of punishment for the same offense, depending on a variety of things. I believe our (Indian) Law allows that.  
  
How many times are we fooled by the 'maximum permissible, and upto x years of Jail' etc ?
