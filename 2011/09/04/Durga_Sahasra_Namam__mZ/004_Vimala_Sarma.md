Dear Radhakrishnan Mahodaya

I think one should distinguish between masculine and feminine as grammatical concepts and not mix it up with sexual genders – man or woman.

For example the word devatA is feminine grammatically, but the word applies to any deity - male or female deity.

The word atmA is masculine grammatically, but applies to men and women – I am also an atmA as a woman.

Similarly the word nAman (name) is neuter grammatically but applies to males and females – everyone has a nAman.

Hope this clarifies

Vimala
