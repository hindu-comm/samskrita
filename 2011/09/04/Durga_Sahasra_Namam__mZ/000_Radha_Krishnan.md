In Durga Sahasranamam, there is a word:

samudbhAva-bhAvitAtmA

The word "atmA" is masculine gender. But, in the Durga Sahasranamam  
"tAp" pratyaya has been added to make it feminine gender. But, in the  
Durga Sahasra namavali, om samudbhAva-bhAvitAtmane namaH . In this  
place, masculine is used, instead of feminine. Can anyone pltease  
tell me why it is?

TIA,  
Radhakrishnan.
