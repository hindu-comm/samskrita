It is very simple. Only आत्मन् is masculine. It is not the case. Have you tried to know the meaning? The text in question reads as follows:

  

महालक्ष्मीसमुद्भावभावितात्मा महेश्वरी ।। २१



and in this case, it seems to be बहुव्रीहि and in बहुव्रीहि it need not be in masculine. And it is feminine here in बहुव्रीहि and there is no change in form in बहुव्रीहि for आत्मन्. It will not take any feminine suffix and can be used as in masculine gender.

  

Hope this makes clear.
