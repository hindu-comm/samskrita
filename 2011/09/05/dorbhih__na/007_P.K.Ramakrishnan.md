Thanks for the lengthy message.

  

The point I was trying to decipher was this.

  

In olden days as a punishment, boys were asked to do toppikkaranam several

times. It is learnt that word is derived from दोर्भि: कर्णं meaning holding the

ears by the two arms. This is performed even while worshiping Ganapati in

the temples.

  

Here only two arms are used. But dorbhih is more than two. Karnam is

singular but two ears are involved in the process.

  

Dr.Bhat could probably resolve the problem.
