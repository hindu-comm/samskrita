Anyhow, I have not heard anything in Sanskrit to this effect though I have also been given the punishment in my younger days in the school and had the exercise also before Ganapati.

  

If any exact verse of Sanskrit is cited, I can solve the problem, but not of this type.

  

बिभ्रद्दोर्भिः कुठारं मृगमभयवरौ सुप्रसन्नोमहेशः।

सर्वालंकारदीप्तः सरसिजनिलयो व्याघ्रचर्मात्तवासाः।

ध्येयो मुक्तापरागामृतरसकलिताद्रिप्रभः पंचवक्त्र-

स्त्र्यर्क्षः कोटीरकोटीघटिततुहिनरोचिष्कलोत्तुङ्गमौलिः॥

  

Just like the question is simple, the answer is also simple. Many do the exercise, holding their ears with their hands. (Only one has two ears and two arms. But no one can have a single ear and many arms as you have cited. But many have many ears and generic term ear कर्ण). If it is a valid citation, it can be solved like as I have explained here above.
