Kalidasa in Kumarasambhava has a sloka mentioning how a person is welcomed

according to his status.

  

The scene is the marriage ceremony of Siva and Parvathy.  Various dignitaries

like Brahma, Mahavishnu, Indra and the Devas start arriving and declare their

arrival to Siva. Siva welcomes them one by one in the following manner.

  

कंपेन मूर्ध्ना शतपत्रयोनिम्

वाचा हरिं वृत्रहरं स्मितेन /

देवांश्च सर्वानवलोकयेन

स्वीकारयामास यथाप्रधानम् //

Satapatrayoni = Brahma Kampena murdhnaa = by the shaking of the head

Hari = Mahavishnu Vaacha =by word

Vruthraharam = Indra Smithena = by a smile

Devan cha srvaan = all the Devas Avalokayene = by looking at them

Sweekarayaamaasa = recceived

yathaa prathaanam = according to status.
