Another way is to use a publication url ...  
  
<http://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=jroyasiasocgrbi>  
  
and drill down to the years for the green icon content..  
  
still wont be able to download whole pdf, but can download individual articles from within the journal  
  
for eg see a note about bhaskaracharya -- <http://www.jstor.org/stable/25581228>
