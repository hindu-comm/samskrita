JSTOR, the scholarlyjournal platform, has made some of its content freely available - anything published before 1923 in America or 1870 in the rest of the world. See the announcement here: <http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/individuals/early-journal-content>.

This will be very useful for independent researchers who cannot usually access this content except by purchasing it. A simple search for Sanskrit throws up lots of interesting looking articles.
