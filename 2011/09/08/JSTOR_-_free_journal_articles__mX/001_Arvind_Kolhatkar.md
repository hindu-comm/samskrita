Venetia,  

  
\<A simple search for Sanskrit throws up lots of interesting looking  
articles. \>  
  

I did so but, after trying in every which way, could not bring up a  
single entry. Can you set out what steps you took - preferably with  
screen captures of the relevant portions?  
  
(Incidentally - and I hope I am not being naive about it - Windows 7  
has a very useful tool, hidden deep inside for some unknown reason,  
for taking screen captures of only that portion of the screen you are  
interested in, and not the whole screen, It is called 'snipping tool'  
and you can find it through Start - Search. Please see  
<http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows7/products/features/snipping-tool>.  
After you take a snip, it goes to the clipboard and can be pasted  
anywhere you want or saved.)
