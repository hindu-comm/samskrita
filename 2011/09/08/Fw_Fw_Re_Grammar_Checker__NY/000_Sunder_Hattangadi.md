Dear all,  
  
The Sanskrit Grammar per say though not available, still the available  
tools can help one to check the correctness of a sentence.  
For example, the tools tell you  
a) which of the words are not recognised by the machine. These then  
are probably the cases of spelling mistakes or sandhied words or  
compounds.  
For example try the following sentence:  
दशरथपुत्रः रामः अयोध्यानगर्यां कोशात् हस्तेन ब्राह्मणाय धनं ददाति.  
on our server  
<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/SHMT/shmt.html>.  
  
It will produce an output where words are in coloured cells. The  
colors indicate their vibhakti in the context.  
Words that are not recognised by the morphological analyser are marked white.  
So for example in the above sentence machine fails to recognise the  
two compounds  
दशरथपुत्रः and अयोध्यानगर्यां.  
  
However, when we run the same sentence by enabling the pre-processor  
(with Anusaaraka splitter), you will see that even the compounds are  
split and are recognised by the machine.  
  
So if you are interested in developing a padagogical text or a text  
with sandhi split, then this tool helps you to identify all those  
places where a split is necessary.  
  
If anybody wants these tools to develop applications on top of it,  
please write to me.  
All our tools are available under GPL.  
  
Further, to check whether the sentence is grammatically correct or  
not, you may use the same system which shows the kaaraka analysis as  
well (if you bring the cursor on the sentence number(eg. 1.1.L) in the  
above case.  
If the sentence is grammatically incorrect, either there will not be  
any parse or the parse will be wrong.  
  
I hope it helps you.  
  
I would apreciate your suggestions in improving the system further.
