Here are the links that explain the concept of Kalpa, Manvantara, etc.

Vicki source:

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manvantara>

  

The same creation exactly is created after a day-break (each kalpa) as in the earlier according to reliable sources. So in each "dvapara" a व्यास (appears in each Manvantara) and divides Veda. Only in this present वैवस्वत मन्वन्तर of the current श्वेतवराहकल्प that कृष्णद्वैपायन re-organized the Veda-s in this 28th द्वापर युग and we are still enjoying the divisions yet. No more details of other मन्वन्तर-s than the name of the sages acting as व्यास-s are available, up to 36 मन्वन्तर-s (and not beyond that is available). No more details of the other कल्प-s and their creation is available than their names and the corresponding मन्वन्तर-s (some times listed).

  

The question is simply answered as at the युगान्त pralaya ब्रह्मा sleeps and next day break is his creation. At the final प्रलय he also retires into ब्रह्माण्ड and again he is the first born in the next cycle of ब्रह्मा. Here Vaishnavite tradition maintain नारायण in his cosmic body absorbs every thing into his stomach and in the next cycle it is created as it is in the earlier Kalpa.

  

This is confirmed by the statement:

  

धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत्

(अहोरात्राणि विदधद्विश्वस्य मिषतो वशी॥ सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ*धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत्*। दिवं च पृथिवीं चान्तरिक्षमथो स्वः॥ -ऋग्. १०.१९०.१-)
