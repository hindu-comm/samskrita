Hi,  
The Pursusha Sukta hymns are not aware of a rigid caste system as present in the Indian society today. Many scholars think the castes these Hymns suggests or talks about were for the purpose of division of labor.  
  
Vedas have a class of Suktas called Khila suktas ( or supplementary verses) some scholars are of the opinion that this may be some very old verses  
  
As far as Atharvana veda is concerned vimalaji is right. Some scholars think it is an early veda but definitely later than the Rig veda as The Atharvan hymns contains spells, curses and remedies etc.  
  
How the Hyms and chants are to be used is clerly mentioned in the Bramhanas and the Kalpa Sutras. These are slightly later works and are not as early as the Vedas. The supervising priests had to know all the vedas, its usages and procedure of sacrifices or Yagnas. (Shistachar conduct of the wise is a source of Dharma)  
  
It is clear at least during the Sutra period the three vedas as Trai existed. Not much is mentioned about the Atharvana veda as its use was restricted. The Atharvana Veda has also Bramhana called Goptha Bramhana and several upanishads are attached to this veda.  
  
The division of vedas were complete long before Chankaya as he speaks about Trai a, Dandaniti etc.  
  
Traditional scholars do not accept this division and history and say all the Vedas, Bramhans Arnyakas upanisads, Kalpa sutras and Dharma Sutra form a single unit. This may be a reason for divegence of opinion between a traditionalist and a modern scholar.
