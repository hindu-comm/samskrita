These things need scriptural proof.  
So, if you get any about anything, you should accept and not otherwise.  
So, sun, moon, etc. are created as they were before because we have a shruti - sUryAchandramasau dhAtA yathApUrvamakalpayat.  
If you get any support in shrutI, purANa-s etc. about avatAra, then you should accept that these will happen as before too and not otherwise.
