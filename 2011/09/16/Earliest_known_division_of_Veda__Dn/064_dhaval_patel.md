Dear Shambhuji,

Very detailed analysis indeed..

  

Some further clarifications are needed in this regard to clarify the issue:

1.सप्तास्यासन् परिधयः and सप्त समिधः कृताः - this refers to the cosmic egg and other events of cosmologic importance.. Kindly give the source / commentary which would benifit us sir...

2. Can this 360 / 365 factor be the number of days?

3. Whether brahmANDa or the egg of brahmA theory is also a later puranic theory or a vedic one ?

4. Any mention of time factors such as kalpa, manvantara, parardha etc.. in vedic literature ?

  

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Dhaval Patel
