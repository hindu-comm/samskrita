Hi,  

Regarding the Origin and growth of Of Vedas and related literature theories propounded by Various scholars can be broadly classified into four

-   Historical Methods: Working hypothesis of Max Muller and others
    which were assumed correct without reading that he proposed dates
    sating that this there are tentative and a working hypothesis. One
    can read Subash C Kak's and other scholars rebuttal of this theory.
    This also includes archeological methods.  
-   Astronomical Methods: Propounded by Bala Gangadhar Tilak . Theories
    of Shyama Shastri Subash Kak's interpretation etc. -   Linguistic and Comparative methods.  
-   Mythological Methods: Reading studying and understanding our Puranas
    and expressing the views contained believed and expressed in Puranas
    and allied literature.

There may be more and better methods not ruling out such a possibality.  
  
Those who are interested in this subject can read different scholarly contributions made by different scholars and undestand the problems and difficulty involved in all or any one of these methods. There is still no unanimity about Vedic dates and when and how the Vedas were divided and classified.  
  
I hope some discussion can be by this Group members and arrive at a woking hypothesis on this difficult and complex subjects involved on this subject  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
