Thanks to the lucid references put forth by Shri Bhat Mahodaya, My question is answered. I think Mm Vimala summarized it nicely saying " the earliest reference to three vedas is in puruSha sUkta".Had I been littlecarefulI could have known this myself.

  

Like I mentioned, I wanted to find out the approximate time of 'division' of a single veda into the three/four we see today. Since we roughly know the time of our epics- ramayana in treta yuga, mahabharata in dwapara yuga etc, I hoped that by soliciting references to anyoccurrencesof veda names, I could get some timeline. 

  

My question is not whether vyAsa being the compiler / person responsible for a division. It was more on the time line.Of courseI assumed any division was done by vyAsa.

  

The reference to the names in puruSha sUkta is the ultimate reference. (My personal belief is that of) the veda being the apauruSheya, it implies that we had four / three veda from the 'beginning'.

  

Yet it is usually attributed to Vyasa that he has compiled/divided. So, something he has done that is similar to such an activity, but we don't know what it is -

  

Thanks for all the answers, The depth and bread of our group and people in it is truly amazing.

  

Thanks a lot,

  

Viswanath.
