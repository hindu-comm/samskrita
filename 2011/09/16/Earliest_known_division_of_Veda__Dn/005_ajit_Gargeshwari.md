Hi ,  
  
  
My apologies for the error in my previous mail. at the beginning of each Kalpa, a Bramha is born. Bramha through his Manasica Putras ( mind born Children) and the first progenitors of mankind re-communicate the Vedas. At the end of every Kalpa the entire universe ( Brmahanda) dissolves back to its source and from the source the Bramhanda evolves back. The Puranas are the source for this information.  
  
The source for of this theory of evolution and involution can be traced back to the Upanishads or to even earlier texts of Bramhanas ( a division of vedas) or some Samhita texts of Rig Veda.In short nothing is created exists or evolves apart from the source which can be called "Brahman" from a philosophical perspective.  
  
Strictly speaking The Vedas were one unit. Vyasa ( literally means a compiler) also called Veda Vyasa compiled the Vedas ( His real name according to Mahabaratha was Krishna Dwaipayan).  
  
When Vyasa compiled the Vedas he divided them into 4 Samhitas and further divided the Samhitas in to four parts. The time of this compilation and division is said to have been done at the end of Dwapara Yuga according to mythology.  
  
Historical perspective offered by modern scholars are different from this  
  
  
  
Regards  
Ajit
