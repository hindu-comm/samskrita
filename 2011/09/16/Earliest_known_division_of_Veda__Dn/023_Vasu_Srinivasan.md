Bhat-ji thanks for excellent references...  
  
Also here is one from Ramayana, where Rama (talking to Lakshmana) heaps praise about Hanuman's knowledge in all 3 vedas:  
  
नानृग्वेदविनीतस्य नायजुर्वेदधारिण: । नासामवेदविदुष: शक्यमेवम् विभाषितुम् । (Kishkinda kaanda, 5.3.26)  
  
To re-iterate the original question, Vishwanath had mentioned that he had wrongly believed that the division happened at beginning of Kali yuga. (Which is not the case). So the question was simply what did Vyasa "compile" ?  
  
The "when/timeframe" answer is best accepted traditionally. Non-traditional "explanations" will merely be opinions.  
  
@Vishwanath  
  
Though this is side tracking - im not sure if Vedas directly mention that paramaatma is nirguna -- the acharyas schools are different...isnt it. (shankaracharya says is nirguna, but not ramanujaacharya and madhvacharya)
