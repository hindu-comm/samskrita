I for one agree that the process of differentiation in the Vedas as lucidly given by Vimalaji is very plausible.

As regards number of authentic Upanishads, one needs to check references made to Upanishads in later works before believing that only 12 are authentic. Recently I came across reference to an Upanishadoutside this twelvein a work dated to 10th to 12th century. I need to search and spend much time to give more details.
