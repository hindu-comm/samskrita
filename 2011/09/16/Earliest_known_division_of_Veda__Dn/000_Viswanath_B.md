Respected Friends,  
  
It is widely held by vaidikas that the veda is originally is a single one, and was divided in to four by Vyasa. I am a bit curious about when this event happened. One way of finding out in an approximate form is to look at our itihasa etc, and see if they mention the veda by names. For example,  
  
1. In bhagavadgIta , krishna says "vedAnAm sAmavEdOhaM". So a division of veda happened before that time.  
  
2. In bharata, when paNdava were leaving for forest having lost the 'match', they are accompanied by their purohita dhoumya who is said to be chanting the atharvaNavEda mantras. So a division of veda happened before that time.  
  
I somehow believed earlier, wrongly, that such a division happened around the beginning of kaliyuga. But now I have reason to believe it happened much earlier. By the time of Kaurava/Pandava, the system is already in place.  
  
Can you site any examples from other epics / otherwise ? Or is it known as to when vyasa did what he did ?  
  
Thanks a lot,  
  
Viswanath
