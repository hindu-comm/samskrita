PS : In continuation of my previous mail. The reason that the division of Vedas already appears to be already in place is due to the fact that Vyasa not only compiled the Vedas divided them he wrote the Mahabaratha and all the Puranas. Vyasa plays an important role in the story of Mahabaratha.  
Please keep in my mind that the entire Mahabaratha is written in the form of a flash back of events narrated at the Sacrifice of Janmejaya.  
  
Hope this clarifies what I have written earlier  
  
Thanks
