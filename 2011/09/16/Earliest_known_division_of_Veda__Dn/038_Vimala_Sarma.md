No it is not valid to conclude Atharva is included in PuruSa sUkta. The verse just mentions hymns, chants, metres but we are not sure if the reference is to the collections (vedas) or to what happens at a yajna. One should be careful in not jumping to conclusions. It is not clear if the vedas all existed as complete works at the time. It is strange that one hymn in the Rk should mention itself as complete and all the others, so scholars regard the puruSa hymn as being one the latest in Rgveda. Another reason for thinking this is that it also has the only reference to the four castes in the Rgveda. Rk means hymns of praise to gods. The Atharva has spells, curses and rememdies etc. Also not valid to think the supervising priest in the yajna - the brahman - knew the atharva. This collection came much later and many communities still regard the vedas as being "threefold - trayI"
