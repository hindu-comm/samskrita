Whatever is written in the linked pages has no shAstra basis.

If Vedas were revealed in each kalpa, who were the revealers and who  
heard them, and did the humans somehow get them later? Humans came  
along only in this kalpa, starting from Svaayambhuva Manu. No purANa  
or shAstra differs on this issue. shAstras claim that Svaayambhuva  
first received the Vedas from Brahma in this kalpAdi. They don't claim  
anything for the prior kalpas. Do they?

If we accept the view that a Vyasa incarnates in each dvAparAnta and  
compiles the hitherto revealed/retained Vedas for pedagogical reasons,  
since Svaayambhuva Manu, there have been (following Manumsr\`ti's math)  
71x6 + 28 = 554 dvApara-s and therefore that many Vyasa-s.

A little reflection would indicate that this pedagogical need would  
arise only during the avarohaNa part of the 4 + 4 yuga cycle, and no  
such need would arise in an ArohaNa part. This would lead to the  
conclusion that there were 227 Vyasas to date, kr\`SNa dvaipAyana being  
the last, and the divisions of the accumulated/retained Vedas have  
been done 227 times in this kalpa. We have no basis to say that each  
compilation or division was identical, but the earlier divisions would  
have had bearings on the latter ones. Based on this view, we cannot  
weigh in that, for example, tattirIya Upanishad is later to kr\`SNa  
dvaipAyana, or atharvaNa is of this kaliyuga. The idea or work of the  
four divisions of the one Veda could have been there well before  
Kr\`shna Dvaipaayana, way far back in the first dvAparAnta of the  
present kalpa itself.
