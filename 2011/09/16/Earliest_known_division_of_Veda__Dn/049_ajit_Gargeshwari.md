Hi  

It seems that these व्यास-s compile the ऋक्, यजुः, साम and अथार्वाङिरः mantras, into separate collections for the purpose of their utilization in the चातुर्होत्र sacrifice in each मन्वन्तर-s and in each Yuga-s. Otherwise, the earlier references  

May i ask a question  
So do the sacrifes the way they are conducted and the mantras, drvayas etc used are they different in each मन्वन्तर-s or do they change as per the compilation of Vyasa in each मन्वन्तर  
Thank you  
Regards
