Thanks Mm. Vimalaji.

  

Even though casually, you have touched the question raised by Vasuji in his reply. The point raised was if the Veda-s were four, even before कृष्णद्वैपायन s/o पराशर, what did he compile as the पुराण-s claim him as वेदव्यास (the compiler/expounder of Veda-s). As I had quoted in earlier messages, there are many other Purana references that he is the वेदव्यास in this 28th द्वापरयुग, in the current वैवस्वतमन्वन्तर. (the 7th of मन्वन्तर-s i.e. 7x4 - 28) (a rough calculation) of the present श्वेतवराहकल्प and in each the different sages will be वेदव्यास and the list up to the current one and the candidates for the post in the subsequent ones also are given in the Puranic sources. It seems that these व्यास-s compile the ऋक्, यजुः, साम and अथार्वाङिरः mantras, into separate collections for the purpose of their utilization in the चातुर्होत्र sacrifice in each मन्वन्तर-s and in each Yuga-s. Otherwise, the earlier references

  

KūPur, 1, 27, 50.2

एको वेदश्चतुष्पादस्त्रेतास्विह विधीयते /   
वेदव्यासैश्चतुर्धा तु व्यस्यते द्वापरादिषु // (५०.२)

  

And coming to the ascription to Vyasa, as their re-organizer into four, it comes also in the same line as in the Purusha, which refers to a यज्ञ. According to the sources quoted in शब्दकल्पद्रुम - वाचस्पत्य, Veda-vyasa, received the 4 Veda-s by the grace of Shiva himself (according to कूर्मपुराण- sources), and taught to his four disciples who were already adept in Veda-s वेदपारग-s - सुमन्तु (अर्थर्ववेद), जैमिनि(सामवेद), पैल (ऋग्वेद), वैशम्पायन (यजुर्वेद) again सूत लोमहर्षण was taught इतिहास as the 5th Veda (who narrates us all the महाभारत and पुराण-s).

  

The combined was यजुर्वेद, Vyasa divided into 4 according to their utilitarian basis the combined body of the text चातुर्होत्र (the mantra-s recited by the 4 participants of a यज्ञ) while he performed a यज्ञ:

  

  

एक आसीद् यजुर्वेदस्तं चतुर्धा व्यकल्पयत्।

चातुर्होत्रमभूद् यस्मिन् तेन यज्ञमथाकरोत्॥

  

This has been already listed by Mm. Vimalaji, in her posting. Only the last ब्रह्मा is authorized with अथर्ववेद.   

  

आध्वर्यवं यजुर्भिः स्याद् ऋग्भिर्हौत्रं द्विजोत्तमाः।

औद्गात्रं सामभिश्चक्रे ब्रह्मत्वं चाप्यथर्वभिः॥

  

All the Rik-s, Yaju-s, sAma-s and atharva-s separated and again classified into different शाखा-s as we know from different sources today, including the महाभाष्य 21 ऋक्शाखा, 100 यजुःशाखा-s, 1000 सामवेदशाखा-s and 9 अथर्व-शाखा.

  

Considering the wording वेद - in बृहदारण्यक and गोपथब्राह्मण related with the statement of पुरुषसूक्त with the concept of मनोमयः पुरुष with the 4 ऋग्-यजुः-साम-अथर्वाङिरः as his components (The references already quoted in my earlier posts with exact location) and the later statement of वाल्मीकिरामायण quoted by Srinivasan, apart from the mutually contradictory statements of पुराण-s one is really confronted with the question when did the 4 fold division exist? If before, the question is pointed what did कृष्णद्वैपायन as व्यास did? If not existed earlier, what does the statements of ऋग्वेद, यजुर्वेद, सामवेद, and अथर्ववेद in मुण्डक and बृहदारण्यक refer to? How to account for it taking as produced earlier than Mahabharata? The the statements of पुराण-s are also divided as some ascribing the origin of the 4 Veda-s and all the विद्या-s from the 4 faces (respectively) of ब्रह्मा, the creator at the time of each cycle of creation i.e. his working hours a कल्प. And we have come across already many statements ascribing the division to कृष्णद्वैपायन as the व्यास in this 28th द्वापर and many allude to one more व्यास in the next as the अश्वत्थम - द्रौणि in the Kali.(LingapuraNa). and some more in later द्वापर-s.

  

So I agree with Aravindji's opinion that leaving apart the mythological considerations, we can safely say at some time in the history, they were classified into four divisions irrespective of mythological statements. The other way, interpret the verses accordingly that कृष्णद्वैपायन as

व्यास taught and spread the four Veda-s he received from ब्रह्मा himself, to his 4 disciples who spread them widely through different disciples. For each शाखा is named after a ऋषि probably disciples of these four and totally ascribed the credit of spreading to their teacher asव्यास a title ofhonor. This seems to be the possible explanation of the verses ascribing the division to कृष्णद्वैपायन accepting their statements tentatively and reconciling them with the Vedic statements especially in the उपनिषत्-s. I couldn't reckon the 28th द्वापर and 28th कलि in the कल्प, मन्वन्तर (१४), युग (४) system of calendar.

Taking this Seventh वैवस्वर Manvantara as comprised of 4 युग-s, this 28th द्वापर and कलि seems to work our 7 x 4 - 28. In the next मन्वन्तर it would be 29th द्वापर for the व्यास to come to re-organize.

  

Hope this converges the question to some direction.
