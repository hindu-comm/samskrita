What do you mean by veda-s ?  
Tradition takes fixed bunch of words as veda-s.  
According to some people, knowledge is veda. Tradition has not said this ever.

OK.

Those things, which are out of grasp of our eyes, etc., if not determined by any authority become victim of possibilities without base. So is here.  
I mean you must present some proof from scriptures itself to support your possibility.

Someone in advaita-l group said as "anantA vai vedAH", so only a portion gets revealed always and rest is kept in heart of Ishvara.  
  
And the portion useful for this thread is :  

    > In a particular kalpa, one small set of veda mantras is revealed from the
    > infinite knowledge-bank of Jagat-kAraNam brahma.

    Any proof ?
    I heard it just now.
    It will prove that veda-s which are revealed in different kalpas are
    different.
    Ishvara gave brahmA veda-s - is known to all, but he gives specific part in
    specific kalpa is a new idea.
    Moreover, if different veda-s(mantra-s for your clarity) are revealed in
    different kalpa-s, they must create non-identical kalpa-s and each kalpa
    must miss some entities, as some specific animals, etc., to be different.

    This is from another post :

    We say that whole veda is given to brahmA and he gives different shAkhA-s to
    R^iShis.
    We have never said that un-breathed  veda-s even exist.

Don't just go on imagining.  
Give us reasons to believe.
