Arvind Mahodaya  
Did you see my post on the origin of the vedas?- This is the view of many  
scholars. It was because of the division of responsibility of tasks between  
the priests at the yajna; not because some scholar later decided to divide  
it up. However I note and respect the traditional view put forward re VyAsa  
by others in this group drawing on the purANas. I think people in this  
group already know from my posts that I do not necessarily regard these  
stories as being historical facts and will be tolerant of me!  
Vimala
