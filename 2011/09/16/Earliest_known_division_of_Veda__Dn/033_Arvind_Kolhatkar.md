It is said that if you look upon Mahabharata and Ramayana as  
mythological works, you discern history in them. If you treat them as  
history, you are confronted with mythological elements.  
  
The same principle applies to the quotation extracted by Sunderji.  
  
A great mass of oral literature, created by countless generations, had  
come down from generation to generation through collective memory. At  
some stage, a scholar, or perhaps several scholars, not necessarily  
working to a pre-ordained design, and not necessarily  
contemporaneously working together, decided to systematize this  
compendium of oral literature for its better preservation and this,  
over a period of time, created the 3-fold division of Vedas.
