A few differing points of view:  
  
The rik-yajus-sAma characteristics (lakSaNas) of the Veda are not the  
same as the 'classification', 'division', or 'compilation' of the  
Veda. Several samhitA mantras in the Rigveda (ex.: puruSa sUkta quoted  
in the thread) and the Yajurveda (ex.: chamaka) may be cited - they  
only state these three characteristics, not classifications. These  
lakSaNa-s are apauruSeya just as the Veda mantras are.  
  
The classification of the Veda into four Vedas (into four ‘books’) is  
pauruSeya. Its purpose was pedagogical – to teach, transmit, and  
retain through the kaliyuga when the human capacity for memory is  
weak. From very early times in the tradition, after vedArambha (of  
8-16 year olds), reciting the Vedas is the first task in the learning  
process. In fact, the proper recitation itself is the Veda (mantra).  
prayoga, viniyoga, paddhati, and the rituals are learnt after a few  
years of vedAbhyAsam, and not the other way. The rituals are also the  
means of learning the truths conveyed in the mantras (by and large, it  
is Vedic cosmology). Ritual usage through hotr\`, adhvaryu, etc. is the  
result, not the cause. These days, a typical karma kANda practitioner  
makes use of all the four Vedas in a typical ritual, such as a  
gaNapati havana. Even in the daily sandhyA vandana or the nitya pUjA,  
Rigveda and Yajurveda mantras are employed.  
  
The four Vedas referred to in some Upanishads quite likely allude to  
the 'classification' into four 'books', but we have little pramANa to  
claim that it was after the last such work attributed to Paraashara's  
son Kr\`shna Dvaipaayana during the last dvAparAnta. Tradition holds  
that there were earlier classifications by earlier Vyasa-s.  
  
Nonetheless, there is no confusion in the vaidika tradition on the  
above two aspects of the Vedas, i.e., the three apauruSeya lakSaNas  
vs. the four pauruSeya pedagogical divisions.  
  
Is a brahma born at the beginning of each kalpa? Not quite – a kalpa,  
by definition/usage of the word, is brahma’s one day. The kalpa in the  
shAstras is specifically to our local brahma – the ruler of the solar  
system (cf. “Aditya maNdalAdhipataye brahmaNe namaH” in the nitya  
pUjA). All our yuga chronology is limited to our Aditya maNdala.  
Stretching this to the universal pitAmaha brahma is the feat of the  
purANa commentators. It has no shAstra basis. Is there?  
  
There is no such view in the tradition that Vyasa ‘codified’ the Vedas  
or received them from brahma. Tradition and vaidika practitioners hold  
that kr\`SNa dvaipAyana and his shishya-s gathered all the Veda mantras  
that were in use in their time and arranged them in the current four-  
book form for ease of pedagogy. However, some mantras we use now  
(appearing in the baudhAyana sUtras) are not in these four Vedas. The  
most recent chChandodarshana (with 450 new rik mantras) is also not in  
them.
