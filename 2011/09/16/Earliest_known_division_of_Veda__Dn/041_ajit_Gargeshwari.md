Hi,  
  
The Aryans had with them from time immemorial verses which were handed over to them, which were used to perform simple Sacrifices( Yagnas). With the passage of time sacrifices became elaborate and complex. A need was felt to organize the verses in to several books. The three Samhitas Rig, Yajur and Sama came into existence. The principal behind the division of the Vedic mantras was to arrange it in a fashion that would make it easy for its usages and applications in sacrifices.  
  
The Samhitas of Rg veda were large. They were first divided in to eight Mandalas and each of this Mandalas have hymns predominantly attributed to one Rishis. One can see some hyms in these Mandalas attributed to other Rishis as Well. The miscellaneous hyms were put into first and tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda. Some scholars are of the opinion that hyms especially in the tenth Mandalas are late Hyms. Hence Purusha Sukta which forms a part of the tenth Mnadala already knew about the classification of Hyms in to Samita.  
  
Before reciting any hymn it is customary to Say the name of Devata, Rishi, and the Chandas used in the Hymns. If one asks to prove this on rigorous historical methods it might be difficult.  
  
Over a period of time questions were asked who and when did this classification took place. Traditionalists said they were done by the Sage Veda Vyasa. These legends were included in Mahabharatha and other allied Puranas. Why they Sage Vyasa and not a group of Sages might be difficult to answer.  
  
Over a course of time concepts of Avatars or the theory of Avatara came in to existence and was accepted. Vyasa was declared as an Avatara of Shiva or Vishnu.  
  
The claims of Puranas may not always have rigorous historical backing in the modern sense but they do have a lot of historical facts in them embedded with myths and legends.  
  
Please note this one possible theory used by experts to explain. I am not saying this is the only theory and has to be accepted in Toto.
