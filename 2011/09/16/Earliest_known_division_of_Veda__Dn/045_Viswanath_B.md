Its a good question about how I could say what I said. Its true that I have not learnt the veda to be able to quote from there, just learning my own sakha is taking lots of time. I could have been correct. What I wrote is my understanding from my readings of teachings of paramacharya. There was one beautiful excerpt of an interaction between paramacharya and a school teacher about sandhya vandana. Ofcourse, there is the *ekam sat, vipra bahudha vadanti*. I have believed that there are all various forms of the brahma padartha. Rudradhyaya praises various forms of eshwara. Like somebody mentioned in the thread, this may be an advaitin point of view. What I have also learnt, is that there is no such thing as an incorrect or a correct thing, Every thing is relative and has a context. To be precise, this is my own hypothesis, which helped me in my life so far.

Off topic, but my understanding is that there are theories and likely working models exist about such particles. At least, the scientists are trying to validate these theories. Any scientist trying to prove the existence of God ? Nobody, IMHO.

Fair enough, I will probably join the advaitin thread soon, seems lot of good discussions over there. But my understanding is that there will be no answers to these questions, As one learns more, you will have newer definitions.  
  
I sense that i am construed as a non-traditionalist based on my email. If that is the case, its not true. I am a traditionalist, I was trying to avoid the discussions on origins of veda since there will be divergent views, but confining to known sources of....  
  
Thanks
