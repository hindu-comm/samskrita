I don't see that. You are mixing up the various brahma-s. Also,  
anumAna based on valid pramANa(s) is also a valid pramANa; hence  
analysis and deduction must be accepted or its basis must be  
contested, not anumAna itself.  
  
Chapter 1 of manusmr\`ti has little to do with Dharma shAstra – it  
outlines the creation, created species’ classifications, and  
kAlagaNanA (in the first 84 verses), and then only summarizes (in the  
remaining 35 verses) the Dharma shAstra appearing in the succeeding  
chapters. Have you studied the first 84 verses?  
  
Anyway, we are deviating from your original questions. I hope the  
learned members won't get irritated - here is another long note for  
those who may kindly check me out:  
  
The kalpa you are referring to is the mahA kalpa where the entire  
universe including the primordial Apa submerges cyclically -  
pertaining to the universal pitAmaha brahma. purANa-s use the word  
kalpa and mahAkalpa interchangeably, and the right meaning must be  
assigned from the context. Manusmr\`ti refers to the pitAmaha brahma as  
one born from svayambhu but does not give a time frame for or even a  
notion of this mahA kalpa. svayambhu first created Apa, placed his  
seed in it (he entered it and resided in it - so he is nArAyaNa, since  
nArA is Apa). That seed is the brahma pitAmaha. He received (heard in  
his ears) the Veda(s) from nArAyaNa in his 'first year' when he  
resided in samAdhi inside the golden egg. ‘hiraNyagarbha’ of shruti is  
this brahma: hiraNyagarbhaH samavartatAgre bhUtasya jAtaH patireka  
AsIt (Rik 10-121-1). As per shruti, rudra pre-dated him: yo devAnAm  
prathamaM purastAdvishvAdhiyo rudro maharishi; hiraNyagarbhaM  
pashshyata jAyamAnagm sa no devaH shubhayA smr\`tyA samyunaktu –  
mahAnArAyaNopanishad. But the purANa-s describe 11 rudra-s as having  
born from the pitAmaha brahma.  
  
Shruti recognizes seven paridhi-s in this golden egg. Ten secondary  
eggs are inside the brahmAnda egg, a few more eggs inside these  
secondary eggs, and a few more inside the tertiary, and so on till the  
chandra maNdala(s). Starting from the lowest, these paridhi-s are:  
chandra maNdala, agni (pr\`thivI) maNdala, sUrya (nakSatra) maNdala,  
vAyu (galaxy) maNdala, indra (galaxy cluster) maNdala, br\`haspati  
maNdala (local group), and prajApati maNdala (these are ten), all  
within the brahmANda. Our agni maNdala was named as the bhU maNdala  
(we are on it), our sUrya maNdala as Aditya maNdala (with a brahma as  
its adhipati), our vAyu maNdala as soma maNdala (with a viSNu as its  
adhipati), our indra maNdala as vahni maNdala (with a shiva as its  
adhipati), our br\`haspati maNdala as parameSTi maNdala (with parameSTi  
prajApati brahma as its adhipati), and our prajApati as vasiSTa who is  
also a prajApati brahma. Modern astronomy has grasped the universe up  
to the local group; beyond that the picture is hazy like the ancient  
Greeks' 'flat earth.’ (As congruence, yoga texts recognize in our body  
seven maNdala-s with similar names.)  
  
A side-note: Agni, sUrya, and vAyu devatA-s exist in each paridhi’s  
pr\`thivI, dyau, and antarikSa. These are the three in the triH sapta  
samidhaH kr\`tAH (puruSa sUkta), corresponding to the three vyAhr\`ti-s  
bhU, bhuva, and suva.  
  
Up to the vahni maNdaala we offer our namaskAra-s during our nitya  
pUjA (in the pITa pUjA section of the panchAyatana pUjA paddhati); so  
this is in the paddhati, and we can accept it:  
  
aum Aditya maNdalAya namaH \| Aditya maNdalAdhipataye brahmaNe namaH \|  
aum soma maNdalAya namaH \| soma maNdalAdhipataye viSNave namaH \|  
aum vahni maNdalAya namaH \| vahni maNdalAdhipataye shivAya namaH \|  
  
Some paddhati-s have ‘arka’ in place of 'Aditya’ but this description  
of the pITa in the pUjA room is common in the vaidika tradition.  
  
We don't know who but some shAstrakAra had figured this out. Let us  
not equate the saptAsyAsan paridhayaH (rik - puruSa sUkta) to 7 darbha-  
s around the homa kuNda and lose their cosmological content. Thinking  
so would be primitive. The ritual of homa is to learn the story of the  
brahmANda and its creative process. Therefore we pray – in every homa  
- to aditi, anumati, and sarasvati (to grant the wisdom) and to Savita  
(to create): aditenu manvasva, anumatenu manvasva, sarasvatenu  
manvasva, deva savita prasuva.  
  
The mahA kalpa notion is for svayambhu's brahmAnda. sveta varAha, etc.  
30 (or 34) kalpa names are of the brahma of our own Aditya maNdala.  
Stretching our local kalpa to brahmANda's kalpa is the feat of the  
purANa commentators; purANa-s per so don’t claim so. We do bow to  
these great commentators for their enormous analytical depth and  
spiritual heights, but we need not shy to disagree or, worse, get  
stuck in a primitive mould.  
  
The same purANas you and Ram Kumar ji quote claim that brahma lives  
for 100 years, not for one kalpa, with a parArdha having passed (i.e.,  
360x50 kalpas, according to the purANas, and I haven't seen any  
shAstra pramANa for this 360 factor). From the day-kalpa to the night  
kalpa our local brahma stops his active work and takes rest  
(manusmr\`ti 1-74). He does not die but sleeps in the night kalpa. So  
losing knowledge from (our local) kalpa to kalpa does not happen.  
Going by the purANa-s, it will happen, within our solar system  
neighborhood, after about a parArdha.  
  
For an idea of the various brahma-s, the first 84 verses of manusmr\`ti  
must be studied. This requires some analysis. A one-liner quotation  
may not help much. purANas may be examined, but they too agree with  
Manusmr\`ti on this issue, provided we understand which brahma’s kalpa  
the purANa-s narrate. As noted above, we are dealing with four brahma-  
s (hiraNyagarbha, vasiSTa, parameSTi prajApati, and brahma), one  
viSNu, and one shiva in our 7-paridhi chain. The choice of viSNu and  
shiva may convey this: galaxies sustain, galaxy clusters encourage  
collisions and annihilations, and the other maNdala-s are  
characterized by creative processes.  
  
Another side-note: The prAta smaraNa shloka ‘brahmA murAri  
tripurAntakAri, bhAnuH shashi bhUmisuto budhascha, guruscha shukraH  
shani rAhu ketavaH, kurvantu sarve mama suprabhAtam‘ depicts our  
neighborhood till the galaxy cluster.  
  
Now, to manusmr\`ti, chapter 1 (verse numbers noted in brackets):  
  
One Manu was approached by Bhrugu and other sages. This Manu, referred  
to as svAyambhuva Manu, characterized the first creator as svayambhu  
(1 to 6).  
  
This svayambhu, Himself the ParamAtman, created Apa (also known as  
nArA), entered it (He is therefore called nArAyaNa), and He Himself  
was then born as Brahman. In the golden egg he was in, he meditated  
and received the full Veda. He is famously known as puruSa (7 to 12).  
  
This Brahman created the subtle mind, the ego, and the five great  
elements. From these seven very powerful puruSas springs this world  
(13 to 21).  
  
He created the deva-s, sAdhyA-s, and the sanAtana yajna (22).  
  
For obtaining the fruits of the yajna, from agni, vAyu, and ravi, He  
milked ‘trayam brahma sanAtanam’ having the rik, yajus, and sAma  
lakSaNa-s (23).  
  
He created time, time divisions, nakSatra-s, graha-s, the material  
world (rivers, mountains, oceans), tapa, vAk, kAma, krodha, dharma,  
adharma, etc. in order to create living creatures next (24 to 31).  
  
This is the narration till verse 31. Creation outlined thus far is all  
by tapas (heat/energy and material amalgamations).  
  
He divided His own body and became half male and half female, and with  
that female, He produced virAj (32). We see the similarity with the  
model seen in the puruSa sUkta.  
  
virAj engaged in tapas and produced ‘aham’, and ‘aham’ then created  
the ten prajApatis, who, except nArada prajApati, in turn created  
seven brilliant Manu-s, deva-s and deva-gaNas-s, and maharishi-s of  
limitless power (33 to 36). I take the word ‘aham’ here as a technical  
term denoting a brahma (ahamasmi brahmAhamasi – shruti), not the  
generic “I”. Otherwise, there is room for confusion. Note that only  
seven Manu-s were created.  
  
The chaturyuga-s, manvantara-s, and brahma ahorAtri in the manusmr\`ti  
apply to the solar system (Aditya maNdala) only, since verses 1-64  
through 1-73 take the time division scheme from our ahorAtri to that  
of the pitr\` (our one lunar month), deva-s (our one year), and brahma  
(our 24,000 years) all in units of our ahorAtri. Therefore the  
manvantara scheme is also within the solar system. If the manvantara-s  
and the kalpa-s are only for the universal brahmANda, why has the  
shAstra missed the time divisions of the soma maNdala, vahni maNdala,  
parameSTi maNdala, and the prajApati maNdala? On kAlagaNana, this  
shAstra, or any other shAstra, does not say anything for the entire  
brahmANda (which is over the 7th paridhi). All we find is the  
stretching by the numerous commentators – from Kalluka Bhatta to  
present. These are logical absurdities.  
  
There is no Dharma shAstra in any of the above verses. Further  
examination of the Manusmr\`ti is not needed to clarify the issue.  
  
Therefore seven Manu-s only have been created (so far) through the  
last parArdha. Verse 79 defines the era of each Manu as spanning a  
manvantara, comprising of 71 chaturyuga-s (each chaturyuga = 12,000  
earthly years) and the seven Manu-s during their eras created  
‘prajAH’ (63). Some purANa-s change this 71 to 72 to make14 manvantara-  
s = 1 kalpa = 1008 chaturyuga durations. The celestial movements do  
not change with such fudging.  
  
Since the duration of 1000 chaturyugas is defined as brahma’s one day  
(verses 71 and 72), and equally brahma’s one night, a kalpa of the  
purAna-s is a little more than 14 manvantara-s. 14 + 14 manvantara-s  
form one sidereal day-night cycle of the Aditya maNdala (our local  
brahma) and 12 more chaturyuga durations make up his one ahorAtri.  
purANas also inform that the present kalpa commenced with svAyambhuva  
Manu at a kr\`ta yugAdi..  
  
Thus, as per the primary shAstra, since only seven Mnau-s have been  
created so far, and that there was no communication breakdown from  
last kalpa to the present (through the deva-s, sAdhya-s, mahariSi-s,  
gandharva-s, kinnara-s, etc. who have been in the Aditya maNdala from  
its inception), it stands established that there was no human race on  
earth in the earlier (our local) kalpa. If there were, more than seven  
Manu-s must have been already created. No shAstra claims so.  
  
purANokta kalpa-s must be understood in line with the shAstra, not the  
other way.
