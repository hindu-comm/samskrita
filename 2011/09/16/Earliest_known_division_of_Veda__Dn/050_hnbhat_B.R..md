As I have replied in my earlier post, it is identical in each "kalpa" the creation is done as in the earlier "kalpa" according to the statement of पुरुषसूक्त. The process of creation according to philosophical schools and Upanishad-s differ from that in पुराण-s though they have some common elements. The main objective of each Purana is condensed in the following popular definition of it:

  

'सर्गश्च प्रतिसर्गश्चवंशो मन्वन्तराणि च।

वंश्यानुचरितं चैव पुराणं पंचलक्षणम्।'

  

as recorded by Amaraपुराणं पंचलक्षणम्।.There is no reason to believe that they should be different in each Kalpa. If any proof to the effect, that they are different, were welcome.

  

With regards
