Viswanath Mahodaya

I agree with Bhat Mahodaya – the earliest reference to the three vedas is in puruSa sUkta in Rgveda. There is nothing before this. But even here we do not know if the reference is to Rk chants, mantras and chandas (accent and metre) which are said at the sacrifice, rather than to the collections – samhitas.
