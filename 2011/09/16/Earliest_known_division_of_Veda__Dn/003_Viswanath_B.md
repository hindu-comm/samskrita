Hi,  
  
I do believe that veda (notice the singular) is aupaurusheya, fully agree. I was looking for the time when this single veda is divided into four by vyasa. You mentioned that this division done at the begining of every kalpa. Could you please let me know the source for this ?  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
