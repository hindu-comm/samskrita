It seems a more a drawn conclusion from what is not stated, as opposed to something that is stated in the shastra as such. My conclusion, from your context below, is that we have insufficient information to make any conclusion. Just drawing a conclusion from manusmriti which is intended to be a *dharma shastra* doesn't seem correct IMHO.  
  
To the best of my knowledge, it is one of the *lakshana* of the puranas that they describe time. From whatever I have read, there has been no mention of humans not being there in any kalpa.  
  
I have a definitive quote from bhagavata to say humans existed in previous kalpa as well. (and so for the other passed kalpas)  
  
Here is how things are described in bhagavatha tritiya skanda -  
  
*The day of brahma is called Kalpa, night is the nimittika pralaya, Each kalpa has 14 manvantaras. End of each kalpa, his day time, Brahma goes to sleep and we will have pralaya where all the three lokas, bhuloka, bhuvarloka, suvarloka, sun & the moon will be destroyed.*  
  
...  
  
*Narayana tells Bramha at the begining of the kalpa - "Do your shrusti just like you did in last kalpa"  
....  
  
Brahma started creating ....Devas, Humans, Animals, birds,,,...  
  
.......  
*  
So the answer to you question is probably clear. Manwantaras are only with in each Kalpa. Do we know who is the Manu in previous Kalpa, we don't know. All of that is destroyed, and created a fresh in the beginning of each kalpa.  
  
From this, my inference to the " countless manwantara passed " , must be across the kalpas, where as only seven manus being created is for this current kalpa, *shweta-varaha-kalpa.*
