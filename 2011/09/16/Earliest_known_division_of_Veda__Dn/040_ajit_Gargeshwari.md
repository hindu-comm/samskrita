My question, to be more precise, is which of our epics / itihasas / otherwise mention the 'vedas' by their name ? We know mahabharata does so. Any others ?  
  

My answer All epics Purans and shastra mention Vedas. Vedas are the Basic texts for all Shastras

  
  
Veda say, the Paramatma is nirakara, nirguna swaroopa. Science needs some guna, some characteristic to prove paramatma's existence. Can they converge ?  
  

What you say is incorrect is this your own hypothesis or is it backed by any reading if so please let me know the source from which you deducted these conclusions.  
  
Doesfundamental particles of Quantum Mechanics have any Guna is it not not a Mathematical hypothesis  
  
The concept of Nirguna, Saguna and Bramhan are not within the scope of this thread. If you would like i can give you the correct and right explanations if you can rise appropriate thread  
  
These questions have been discussed in Advaita mailing list

Indian Philosophy and vedas are not based on any beliefs. Sayings of Vedas are Apourasheya and need no proof. Its in a sense Axiomatic
