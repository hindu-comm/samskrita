Countless manvantara-s have passed (manusmr\`ti 1-80), but only seven Manu-s have been created so far (manusmr\`ti 1-36),named assvAyambhuva, shArochiSa, uttama, tAmasa, raivata, chAkSuSa, and vivasvatsuta (manusmr\`ti 1-62, 63), each one's era being a manvantara in duration. We are in the seventh manvantara of this kalpa. A little over 14 manvantara-s equal to a kalpa duration. There has been no8th Manu, although purANas have named the future Manu-s.``



Manu-s are created beings; manvantara or kalpa is a time duration. If the humans were around in the last kalpa, who was their Manu, when a shAstra informs that only seven have been created so far?



The conclusion is evident.
