Here quoted verse only identifies विष्णु with शिव. It is popular that there are many हरि-हर temples as such compromising वैष्णव and शैव cults, a new phase as it represents was existent during the history of Hindu schools/ cults.

  

But I do not think of the other verse you had quoted (even if you claim to be recited in your family) transplanting विष्णु by व्यास, I could not imagine of such forms as you have typed in the other message because of the forms. But शिव can be easily transplanted by व्यास as it can fit conveniently in the verse without affecting the structure metrically or grammatically as quoted by R Vidya, which is found in most of the विष्णुसहस्रनामस्तोत्र texts. It can be attested in the text available in this link and as I used to recite the Stotra daily.

  

[विष्णुसहस्रनामस्तोत्रम्](http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D)

  

Now it is up to you to support your quoted verse from any reliable source than one typed in your earlier message. Hope all the best. As it is typed in roman script, I could not make out any meaning of it and what you have typed in Devanagari here, has nothing to do with the one typed in your previous message.
