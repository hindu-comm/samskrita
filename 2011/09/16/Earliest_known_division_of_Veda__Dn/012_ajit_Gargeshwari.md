Can one write  
शिवाय व्यसरुपाया शिव रूपया व्यासः  
व्यासस्य हृदयं शिवः शिवस्य ह्रुद्रयम व्यासः  
would this verse be grammatically correct?  
If incorrect please correct me  
  
This was quoted by me in the context in which a member, wanted to know whether Vyasa was an incarnation of Vishnu by quoting a verse that supports that he was an incarnation Vishnu. All I wanted to say was, in that particular verse a variation can be made made that will make Vyasa an incarnation or Shiva or any God. His message is for one and all.  
PS Sri Arvindji asked for a Devanagari version and I tried to type the same  
*Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat says"* I could not imagine of such forms as you have typed in the other message because of the forms. "  
My answer I am not a Grammarian, so thank you for pointing out the error.
