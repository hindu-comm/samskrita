Origin of the Vedas

For those interested in a non-traditional explanation, the vedas arose
because, as the vedic yajna ritual became more complicated, there was a division of labour between the officiating priests so that four distinct roles emerged and each of these classes of priests had their own hymn books; ie samhitas. The priests were:

UgAtR – responsible for singing and his chants were the sAmaveda

HotR – responsible for all recitations and his “book” (read memory) was the Rgveda

Adhvaryu – is responsible for all sacrificial actions, including making oblations etc, and he was the priest of the Yajus – Yajurveda

There was a also a supervising priest, the Brahman, who was the most learned and his role was to correct any mistakes.



These classes of priests were then responsible for maintaining all the hymns correctly and families arising from them (shakas) learnt by heart specific passages, and so on through the generations. These then became more complicated as there were families who “remembered” passages differently so there were splits into recensions of the vedas or “schools”– such as he shukla and kRSNa yajurveda, which in turn gave rise to kaTHa taitterIya etc. The Arthava which was a book of magic and spells became accepted as the fourth veda much later. The vedas a still referred to as traiyI. Each of the hymn collections (samhitas) of vedas grew by having sections added to them subsequently dealing with specific matters – first the brAhmaNas dealing with details of rituals, then the AraNyakas dealing with mysticism and finally the upaniSads ( in some cases embedded in the Aranyakas) dealing with philosophical speculation. Many of the 108 “traditional” upaniSads were not written until the middle ages (16-17 centuries); and so only 12 are identified as being “early” ie authentic part of the vedic corpus – these are bRhadAranyaka, ChAndogya, TaittirIya, Aitareya, KauSItaki, Kena, KaTHa, IshA, MuNDaka, Prashna, MAndUkya, ShvetAshvatara,



Hope at least some of you may be interested in this explanation.
