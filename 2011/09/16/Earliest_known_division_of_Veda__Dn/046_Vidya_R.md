"vyaasa exists in each kalpa":

  

My thought process and questions ->  
Vedas are eternal. Vyasa codifies them in each kalpa. Does this indicate the possibility that in each kalpa, different portions of the Veda get revealed to the various seers (of that kalpa), and different versions of the 'jagat' happen? The 'dashAvatAra's could be a different line in each kalpa (or maybe even in each mahAyuga)... (All within the Vedic umbrella). ...  

  

What is expected to survive across 'yuga's, 'mahAyuga's, 'manvantara's, 'kalpa's ...? Is total-and-absolute 'pralaya' expected to happen when the current 'brahma' withdraws unto himself (at the end of the 2nd parArdha), only for the whole thing to start all over again ('ananta')?


  

Much obliged,

Vidya

Thanks for the detailed analysis. The fact that vyaasa exists in each kalpa sounds the most convincing explanation as he is also considered one of the 7 chiranjeevi-s.
