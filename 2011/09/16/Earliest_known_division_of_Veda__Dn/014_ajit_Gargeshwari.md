Shankaraji,  
  
Thank you for correcting the verse.  
  
As far as scriptural authority is concerned, Please see the quotes below  
  
All the quotes are from Shiva Purana which is one among the 18 Puranas ( I am not disputing the popular belief the Vyasa was an incanation of Vishnu though not among the 10 Dasha Avataras)  
  
So if the Purana says Shiva incarnates in every Kali yuga to save Dharma it means that he devides the Vedas as a Vyasa Avatar as Vedas is nothing but Dharma.  
  
Quote 1  
"There are 4 Vedas in Hinduism, Rig, yegur, samam, adharvana which was composed by Veda Vyasar and he was born as Veda Vyasar who composed Mahabaratha. He was also Lord Shiva's Incarination of Dhakshanamoorthy who initiated the 4 Sanagathi Sages. He was also the incarnation of Lord Hayagreeva who was the Lord Of Wisdom. He has taken numerous incarnations like the above mentioned and has been confirmed by these Nadi's. Likewise Oracles, horoscope experts and Samuthriga Lakshna experts and Siddha and Seers have confirmed that he is the Supreme Lord's true Avatar. "  
  
Quote 2  
The Shiv Purana says that Bhagwan Shiv incarnates in every Kali Yuga for the purpose of “conferring the Dharm of the Vedas to disciples”. “Shulapani himself incarnates upon the earth through the yugas to spread knowledge for the liberation of those in his protection”. (Shiv Purana, Vayaviya Samhita).  
  
Quote 3  
The names of all the incarnations of Lord Shiv are given in the Shatrudrasamhita and Vayaviya Samhita of the Shiv Purana (Chapters 4&5, Chapter 9). They are similarly given in Chapter 51 of the *Poorva Vibhag* of the Kurm Purana. The Puranas also record that in each incarnation the Lord shall have four yogi disciples who shall be adept Yogis and shall attain liberation. The names of all these and those to come in the future are also given. We also know from the authority of these Puranas that these incarnations occur in all the Kali Yugas and that the purpose always is “to assist Vyas” or to “spread” or “strengthen” yoga or the ‘*nivrutty marg*’ the path of renunciation.
