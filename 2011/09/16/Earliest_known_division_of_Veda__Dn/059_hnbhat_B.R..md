NO.

According to Kamoti Jagadguru's statement: here:

>   
> Aspromised by Vishnu, Swayambhu was born in Raghukula as King > Dasaratha and became the father of Shri Rama in Treta Yuga, as > Vasudeva in Yadava Kula in DwaparaYuga

I think reverse is is the case. Now you can produce evidence to support your statement. In द्वापर Vyasa-s born to simplify the huge mass of Vedic Literature by re-distributing them 1/6 amshta of Vishnu, while PurNa avatara is Krishna himself.

  

द्वापरे समनुप्राप्ते तृतीये युगपर्यये / (१४.२)

जातः पराशराद्योगी वासव्यां कलया हरेः // (१४.३)

  

  

LiPur, 1, 24, 125-130 makes it more clear both existed in Dvapara.

  

पाशरसुतः श्रीमान् विष्णुर्लोकपितामहः / (१२५.१)

यदा भविष्यति व्यासो नाम्ना द्वैपायनः प्रभुः // (१२५.२)

तदा षष्ठेन चांशेन कृष्णः पुरुषसत्तमः / (१२६.१)

वसुदेवाद्यदुश्रेष्ठो वासुदेवो भविष्यति // (१२६.२)
