I feel The views of Shabhuji in message: "A few differing points of view" is the right view as per Mimasa Shastra.  
  

-   Vedas are not revealed at beginning of Kalpa it always exists by
    itself as it is apurusheya

&nbsp;

-   The rishis transmit the Vedas to Mankind. -   The rishis are referred to as mantra drashta and NOT Mantra Karta  
-   The Prayogas of Veda mantra are fixed. ( it might vary slightly
    depending on which Kalpa text is used)  
-   The concept of Brahmha as the creator is not directly mentioned in
    Vedic texts -   The name Veda Vyasa is not mentioned either -   Puranic legends have no place in the vedic texts -   Puranas are Smriti and not Shruthi -   Smritis changes with time and not Shruthi

This is my understanding
