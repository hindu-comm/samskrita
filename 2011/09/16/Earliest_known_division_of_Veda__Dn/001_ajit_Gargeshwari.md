Hi,  
Vedas are Apaurusheya and anadi. Vedas were never created and always exists. It has neither a beginning or end it timeless. At the beginning of every new Kalpa Vyasa who is immortal ( Cheranjeevi some says an incarnation of Shiva) divides the Vedas for easy transmission and assimilation, for the benefit of all mankind.  
I hope this rather short explanation helps. For technical details one can read Mimamsa texts . For non scholarly undersatnding onecan read epics. One can also read many modern books written on the subject for greater clarity.  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
