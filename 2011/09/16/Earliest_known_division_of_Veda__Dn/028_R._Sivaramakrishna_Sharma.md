Namaste,

Is'nt that purusha sukta hymn referring to the three classes of  
mantras in the Chandas? i.e. Riks, Yajus and Samans ? The Atharvan, of  
what is left today is primarily made up of Riks. So Atharva is  
included in RichaH just as is the others aswell.

To the best of my knowledge, if the classification were to be  
mentioned in the Vedas itself - what would be the root/adhara of the  
idea of One Veda as expounded traditionally. The following shloka is  
quoted by Sri Adi Shankaracharya in the Sharirika Bhashya 1.3.19 and  
attributes it to Vyasa.

वेदमेकं स बहुधा कुरुते हितकाम्यया ।  
अल्पायुषोऽल्पबुद्धिश्च विप्रान् ज्ञात्वा कलावथ ॥

Logically, if the Shruti itself expounded the idea of many vedas, and  
Shruti itself being the paramapramANa, I doubt if anything else would  
be the root of such a line of thought.

Nevertheless, I have not considered shlesha for the word Veda in the  
verse. That would be different altogether.
