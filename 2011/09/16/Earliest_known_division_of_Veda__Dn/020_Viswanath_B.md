Hi,  
  
I am sorry, but this discussion is veering into some direction, not anticipated by me.  
  
My question, to be more precise, is which of our epics / itihasas / otherwise mention the 'vedas' by their name ? We know mahabharata does so. Any others ?  
  
As far as the other direction goes, We all have our opinions and beliefs. These are influenced by the books we read first, the teachings we hear first, probably in the early part of life. IMHO, none of us are the historians who could say these things since they *know* it. This means that any such discussion won't converge.  
  
Some of you may remember the Men-In-Black movie. The junior agent before he is recruited, says he believes that there are no aliens. The senior counters him - " 1000 years ago people believed that the earth is flat, 100 years ago, people believed that earth is the center of universe". The beliefs, in either direction, are only as long as they are 'proven' wrong.  
  
Science has this bad attribute/nature, that it can't believe what it can't prove. This doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It could just mean science doesn't have the ability to prove it yet. May be some time in future, science acquires the ability to do so. Science is open to that. Unfortunately, we as humans tend to form our beliefs on what science believes today.  
  
Veda say, the Paramatma is nirakara, nirguna swaroopa. Science needs some guna, some characteristic to prove paramatma's existence. Can they converge ?  
  
Apologies for this long diatribe,  
  
Viswanath
