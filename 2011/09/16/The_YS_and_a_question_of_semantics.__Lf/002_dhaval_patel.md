III. 11 sarva-arthata-ekagratayoh kshaya-udayau cittasya samadhi-parinamah

  

After stillness of the mind field (nirodha parinama) is achieved, then room has been

made for the more subtle awareness -- the awareness of the source of awareness

dawns in samadhi-parinama (integration/union) where one is always aware of the

integrative state, although the integration itself may not be complete.

Commentary: Here Patanjali brings up samadhi parinama. Samadhi parinama is a

transformative tool when learned like nirodha parinama it can be applied to

eradicating the arising (kshaya-udayau) of the tendencies of the mind's (cittasya) , it's habitual objectification of I-it duality and fixation tendencies (sarva-arthata) which in

turn disturb the mind's one pointed intent (ekagratayoh). Samadhi then is achieved

through the gradual settling out and eventual calmness of the rising and receding

waves of mental distractions where the dualistic forces of alienation, extraction, or

separation causing the milieu of objectiveness (sarvarthata) ceases altogether, so that

one becomes one pointed in the source of consciousness and bliss (sat chit ananda)

abiding in samadhi. Here consciousness (chitta) is no longer enslaved serving separate

objects, but all is experienced in the living union of the all inclusive matrix -- of ALL

OURRELATIONS -- with universal integrity. This is the change of state (parinama)

which when applied brings forth samadhi.

Here again sarva-arthata (the tendency of the mind to objectify a separate I/it referent

reality) is destroyed (ksayah) through the technique of directing the mind one

pointedly (ekagratayoh) as cittasya samadhi parinama. Samadhi parinama destroys the

dualistic tendency to objectify (sarva-arthata). Samadhi parinama when implemented

consistently over a period of time -- with practice, creates a positive imprint on the

mindstuff (citta) acting as a positive samskara that transforms old negative samskaras,

eventually paving the way to non-dual integration in nirbija samadhi. See Samadhi

Pada Sutra 50.

  

  

III. 12 tatah punah santa-uditau tulya-pratyayau chittasyai-ekagrata-parinamah

  

  

Here Patanjali brings up the powerful practice that achieves ekgrata parinama.

In this way (tulya) by balancing out (in equipose or canceling out the opposites) of the

energy of the arising distracting centrifugal thoughts (udita) with the energy of the

subsiding (santa) centripetal thoughts, a stilling and balancing wave transforms and

remediates (parinama) the apparently discrete separate objects which form the

contents of the ordinary dualistic mind (pratyaya) into a one-pointed

unification/integration (ekgrata) consciousness (cittasya). Here in ekgrata parinama a

state no effort and no movement (nirodha parinama) is realized -- one rests in the

synergistic balance and is embraced in the non-dual harmony, supported by the

ineffable. Ekgrata parinama is usually applied in meditation, but can be applied at any

time as well as arise spontaneously.

Commentary: Once ekgrata parinama is accomplished as the fruition of nirodha and

samadhi parinama, as such it is the end of parinama itself, as no other transformations

are needed. Ekgrata occurs through the exercise unified intent upon and eventually of

our authentic self -- our true nature. It is like implementing an instant reminder or an

instantaneous wake up call that transforms all opposites, dualistic and polar thought

process. Here there is nothing more to transform, because dualism itself has become transformed in the success (jaya) of ekgrata parinama. The citta-vrtti has become

stilled (nirodha).

In the previous sutra the sequential arising of linear thinking has been quelled, one

enters into the ability to know things as they are through focusing on an object or

thing (dharana) be it an object of thought or a sensory object, then absorbing oneself

into that that without distinction for subject/object duality (dhyana), and thus through

this dissolution of separation, merge the observer with the object and the process of

observation (awareness) as one integral process revealing the universal timeless

unbiased true nature of any phenomena..
