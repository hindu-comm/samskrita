All,



As regards the one thread running through the three individual pariṇāma, as enumerated below,

I have never been able to resolve why the second and third of the three stages are so named, opposite to what one would expect.



We have the first stage, concerned with the development of nirodha, being termed nirodha-pariṇāmaḥ, as expected.



But the other two, concerned with developing the states of ekāgrata, and samādhi, are respectively named samādhi-pariṇāmaḥ and ekāgratā-pariṇāmaḥ.



To me, the labels don’t match the processes, as if they (the labels) have been swapped around.



I don’t think its a grammatical problem but semantic?





 III. 9 Vyutthāna-nirodha-saṃskārayoḥ abhibhava-prādurbhāvau nirodha-kṣaṇa-citta-anvayaḥ nirodha-pariṇāmaḥ.

 III. 10 Tasya praśānta-vāhitā saṃskārāt.

 III. 11 Sarvārthatā-ekāgratayoḥ kṣaya-udayau cittasya samādhi-pariṇāmaḥ.

 III. 12 Tataḥ punaḥ \[\] śānta-uditau tulya-pratyayau cittasya-ekāgratā-pariṇāmaḥ.
