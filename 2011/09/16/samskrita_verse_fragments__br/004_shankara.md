Murthyji,

  

I give below its meaning as I understand it.

  

तत्र सन्तु जले ग्राहाः मर्मज्ञा सैव सुन्दरी "There in the water are crocodiles; that same pretty lady (this has to be connected to the first line) is very clever." Apte’s dictionary defines मर्मज्ञा as “knowing the weak or vulnerable points of another”. This woman was very clever and she knew how to convince her husband that she is very much loyal to him.

  

I had heard this story many years back and had written down in my notebook. After reading your comment, I searched the web to get more details but could not locate anything related to this story anywhere.



regards  
shankara
