Dear Members,  
May I ask a question? why does any one need an English Translation of Sanskrit Prosody. I feel prosody is primarily meant to compose Sanskrit poems. So obviously one cannot compose Sanskrit poems if you do not know Sanskrit language.  
  
I think a translation of a Sanskrit prosody texts into English might purely be of academic interest  
  
The link sent by Sunder Hattangadi is a Roman Transliteration and not a translation. The book " Sanskrit Prosody explains the principles of Sanskrit prosody and does not translate any standard prosody text.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
