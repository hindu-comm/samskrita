namaste ramya!

  

I am one of the moderators. Because of the Tamil script, I have not approved it for the group. Please resend your message in roman transliteration (or, including roman transliteration).

  

In the meantime, I can tell you that 'dUtikA bhAva' refers to the emotions and role played by a messenger, in transmitting messages from a lover to a beloved (invariably).

  

dUta is the masculine form, and the feminine form of the word is 'dUtikA'.

  

Regards,

  

Vidya
