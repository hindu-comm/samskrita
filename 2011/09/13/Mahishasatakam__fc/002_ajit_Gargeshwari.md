Hi,  
Please click on this link below to download Mahisha Shataka  
  
<http://www.mediafire.com/?nzjq1kap5mvp6cl>  
  
I am giving this link as members requested me to send them a copy.  
  
This poem is satirical. Many stanzas are difficult and hard to understand in spite of the commentary. I request scholars of this group to help me understand many difficult verses of this work.  
  
There is another similar satirical poem by name Samarjanee Shatakam composed by Asoori Anathacharya Swami. If members are interested I can send a scanned copy of this book.
