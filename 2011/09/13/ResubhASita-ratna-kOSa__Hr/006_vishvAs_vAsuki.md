I appreciate this very much. Hopefully more and more books will be put up on wikisource and [wikitext](http://sa.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D). Particularly with the latter, I envision a future when online books/ commentaries/ explanations (Eg for sUtras in kaumudI) are recorded and cross-linked appropriately through collaborative effort.
