Dear all Sanskrit language lovers and patrons,

I am sending herewith a PDF copy of Sanskrit monthly magazine “Lokabhasha Sushreeh” (as an attachment file) published from our organization – Lokabhasha Prachara Samitih –. We want to improve it further. We expect that this issue will inspire you to write articles for this magazine so as to improve it further to make it world class. Some problems occurred in inserting the pictures during conversion of original PageMaker file to PDF file. If you find an error please notify us. Truly speaking **we are facing acute shortage of people with dedication towards Sanskrit**. Once we find solution to this problem, we will be able to deliver you a Sanskrit magazine with much better content. During the typing of our magazine and converting it to PDF we find many difficulties due to lack of technical and software experts. We will be happy if any body can provide/suggest good quality Devanagari and Sanskrit related software. We need suggestions to make an e-journal of this magazine.

Also we have recently launched our website [http://samskrita.co.in](http://samskrita.co.in/)

You can visit the site to know more about us. The website is still not perfect. Many more things will be added to it. Still you should visit this site to have a glimpse about our organization. We need your help in terms of subscription, sending good articles written in Sanskrit language, suggestions for further improvement of this magazine, Suggestion to start any new innovative work for development of Sanskrit language into world class language, Invitation to conduct Workshop/Seminar/Spoken Sanskrit camp in your area, Developing Sanskrit medium education etc. As an organization we are dedicated to develop Sanskrit in any traditional or innovative way. Suggestions with complete description are also expected from all Sanskrit lovers of this planet. We also promise you to introduce many new interesting features in spite of many hurdles that we are facing here. Expecting your cooperation and reply in this regard.

Yours truly,

Subhendu Rath,
