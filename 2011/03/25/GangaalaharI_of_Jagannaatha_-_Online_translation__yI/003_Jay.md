You stole my question. I was on verge of asking for translation.

A byline..I hope people would not mind transgression from poetics to  
philosophy.......Many would wonder why Ganga is considered so devine. I  
had found answer to this question in SudhaSoundaryam Te Saliamashivam N:  
Shamayatu. How many things or places or people in this world have power  
to vanquish Ashivam? And that is why Ganga is Ganga.
