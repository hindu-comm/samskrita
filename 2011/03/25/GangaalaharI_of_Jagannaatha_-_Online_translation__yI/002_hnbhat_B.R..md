Dear Sir,

  

This is in continuation of my previous message.

  

Anyway, welcome to your offer of a new translation, which would be really authentic, and not just commercial product. And, of course, if made available with the text in Sanskrit documents list, it will be available for free and every learner and lover of Sanskrit will be obliged to you.

  

I could not find a e-book version of any translation of the book, when I had searched long ago. DLI has got certain limitations with higher versions of IE than 6 and may not work with Win.7 too.
