Dear Group,  
  
Can a knowledgeable member of this learned Group point to an online  
translation or a digitalized book containing a translation of  
Jagannath Pandita's GangalaharI? A reader came upon my Devanagari  
transcription of GangalaharI at [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) and has asked  
for a translation. I tried to look for it on the internet and  
particularly in [archive.org](http://archive.org), [books.google.com](http://books.google.com) and DLI at  
<http://www.new.dli.ernet.in> but came up with a blank.  
  
If an online translation is not available, this humble scribe will  
attempt one, though surely मन्दः कवियशःप्रार्थी  
गमिष्याम्युपहास्यताम्...
