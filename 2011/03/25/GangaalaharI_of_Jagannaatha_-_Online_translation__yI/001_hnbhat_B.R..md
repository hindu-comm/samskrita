Dear Sir,

  

I think it is available for purchase online, with a Translation. I remember seeing it in [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) long ago. It is here:

  

<http://www.flipkart.com/flow-ganges-ganga-lahari-panditaraja-book-8186569626>

  

[](http://www.flipkart.com/flow-ganges-ganga-lahari-panditaraja-book-8186569626)in Flikarts with English and Hindi translation. Just googled and got it.

only for Rs.145/-.

  

I myself had learnt by heart the 54 or so verses while learning Sanskrit because of its beauty of expressions. An audio rendering is also available by Bombay Sisters for the same.

If anybody interested, can download it from the forum registering in it. Or I can give the direct link, if not willing to register.

  

With regards
