namo namaH venetiavarya

  

I have (read) an English translation by Rev. Ebenezer Burgess edited by Phanindralal Gangooly.

  

I also got two other books containing the original sanskrit text and hindi translations.

One book is translated by Prof. Ramchandra Pandey and the other by Pandit Madhav Prasad Purohit.

  

I hope this helps.
