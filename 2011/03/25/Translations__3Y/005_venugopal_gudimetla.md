Rahul Mahoday, Thanks you for the review and explanation. It certainly sounds very interesting, now that we have done experimental and theoretical calculations of oribatls speeds etc. it will be very interesting to learn and compare how we fared in relations to latest advancements. I wish to read it.  
  
Thanks,  
Venu
