Do you mean respecting 'Dharmikta' and 'Erudition' is a sin? Or, innovations must be respected trashing these two?  
Is everyone innovative now? What character are we possessing even after living according to Macaulay?

Do you want to say all temples were made by unpropitious kings and against will of people?

People sitting in parliament do not affect us in any way - do you mean this?

So, bhakti is not responsible for your bad character. Why are you blaming bhakti? A man who is hesitating to blame Macaulay, should not raise fingers on bhakti, kings, etc.  
  
You can not force anyone to respect anything, be it dharma or invention. You can show its beauty. Love and respect rise on their own depending on the person. So, respecting dharma or invention is personal matter. If one loves dharma more and is not 'progressing', then don't try to force him. He may be knowingly doing that after thinking about gains and losses. Progress 'here' is not so important for all people. Some love to do something to progress in other dimension. Let them do that.
