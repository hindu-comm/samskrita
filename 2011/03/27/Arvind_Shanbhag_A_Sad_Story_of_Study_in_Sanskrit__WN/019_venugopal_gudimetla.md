Sir, Your statement is like saying "the one who pulled the trigger didn't kill, but the gun killed the victim". Your claim that Macaulay has nothing to do with Sanskrit getting completely wiped out from India doesn't hold water that too when the perpetrator himself had to say this, please see attached image.

Industrial revolution is only a reason, a facade, but that fueled greed, coupled with racism, a notion that they (Europeans) are God's chosen few and that they have the right to rule and "civilize the savages", led to imperialism. It is this reason that led to people like Macaulay to our land. If only Europeans are not guided by greed, if only they are not guided by divine hand to "civilize the savages" so as to spread the "word of God", Sanskrit would have been there in some form, mind you, I didn't say it would have flourished, but it would have been there the way it was before the Brits showed up at least.

Again European languages didn't spread to other nations because they had the potential to just flow our of Europe and descend on nations thousands of miles away separated by seas. The reason they spread is because of imperialism. And what did imperialist do to the nations they "conquered" ? they razed them to ground, Our India, Inca civilization, African nations etc are proof to that. Industrial revolution is just a facade sir, nothing more.  

***\>\>Why did the Industrial revolution not start in India. Jared Diamond (in book named "Guns Germs and Steel") has AN (I would not say THE) explanation. The society respected Dharmikta and Erudition, not innovation. The fruits of invention had little less value at personal level as it would be shared in the whole extended family. The kings were considered great based on how big temple was built, not whose populace had more prosperity.*** ***How do we blame Macaulay for lack of Civic Sense? Dharm and Bhakti are different and society puts more emphasis on second. As long as I do my  morning Pooja, I am fine and can bribe the policeman during the day for traffic violation, I do not need to learn Sanskrit, and can blame Macaulay.***

***Sir, I read Jared Diamond too, Its a nice book. I also watched his documentary. Sir, ever heard of Pythagoras theorem? That dates back to Brahma gupta. There are many examples of Indian innovation and ingenuity which the Arabs and Europeans claim to be their work. We Indians look at innovation as offshoots of Dharmic laws, they are natural outcomes of human thought, we don't look at them as necessities, they are by products of deeper thought processes which don't seek profits, they don't seek human comforts that which need to be capitalized, because of lack just of a zeal among Indians to capitalize on innovations, assuming that we are not innovative is fallacious and very condescending if one thinks about it.  
  
What has building temples, comparing the heights of temples and mud-slinging has to do with Sanskrit getting wiped out from India? If Indian kings are buildings temples, that should have an indirect effect of spreading the arts and languages, how is that they helped Sanskrit getting wiped out? please kindly explain, to me it is a leap of logic. And you state that the subjects of kings were poor? it is not true, if any nation is poor, that would be England in a comparison to India, India's GDP was among the best till the thugs came and raped India, I posed an url to support this, kindly refer to my previous post. And also India;s economy was 25% of the world till the Brits came, so kindly explain why you think the populace was poor and the kings let their subjects to dogs.  
  
Sir you are greatly digressing, what has civic sense has got to do with Sanskrit getting wiped out from India? the present plight of India is result of at least a century of plunder, again, please refer to the link I posted. If a nation is robbed of it's riches, looted out rightly, neglected, what else can you expect? if there is corruption sure there would be, if there is illiteracy, sure there would be, things take time to change. Nation building doesn't happen in a decade, it takes time, that too after a century of plunder. Sir, you could be an atheist or may not be, for a person who performs pooja, it is his birth right, it gives him solace and gives him the confidence to step out and work hard, who are we to sneer? For every bribe taker, there is also a bribe giver. But what has it got to do with Sanskrit? we only take bribes sir, what to do we are a poor nation, atleast we didn't rape women, atleast we didn't plunder or divide a nation, nor did we ruin a civilization. You can't blame everything on Indians and give a clean chit to Macaulay that too when he himself states the reason why he had to introduce a nefarious education system.
