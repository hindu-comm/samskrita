Dear Vimala MahodayA,

  
  

I thought you said there were schools in every village before the British. How does one know what was taught or not  

taught at home?

  

Indeed I did. This was said by William Adam in his first report. Home schooling subjects are same as those in "proper schools", the only difference being that instruction is from parents, relatives or privately hired tutors. For that matter, most higher learning was done at homes of teachers (or in Agraharams). Statistics from Malabar show 21 times as many students in home tution than in schools.

  
  

These Madras colleges were there in British times â€“ so what is the point you were making?

  

Firstly, these are Indian indigenous schools that are being referred to, not the ones set up by the British. These are surveys made around 1825 and 1885, where a sharp degradation is seen in the schooling system in 1885 compared to 1825. Schools in 1825 were already under the state of decay, being under British rule. So the point is best stated in the words of Dharampal himself:  
  
"...the descriptions of life and society provided by earlier European accounts (i.e. accounts written prior to the onset of European dominance) of different parts of India, and the data on Indian exports relating to this earlier period (notwithstanding the political turmoil in certain parts of India), on the whole leaves an impression of a society which seems relatively prosperous and lively. The conclusion that the decay noticed in the early 19th century and more so in subsequent decades originated with European supremacy in India, therefore, seems inescapable."

  
  
You are entitled to your opinions.  

Sure, but atleast know the facts first. Read **The Beautiful Tree**. But if a blind eye is to be stubbornly turned on all these data (as has been done for the past 120 years), I shall not say anything further.
