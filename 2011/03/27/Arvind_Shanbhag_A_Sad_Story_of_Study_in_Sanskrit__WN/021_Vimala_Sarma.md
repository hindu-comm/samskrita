Dear PaNDitAH

I just want to set the record straight on just one small point, which I am sure about. When William “Oriental” James was Judge at the Supreme Court of (then) Bengal in the very early days of colonialism, Sanskrit was not spoken by the general public nor was it studied by anybody who wished to. In fact Sanskrit was never spoken by the masses, at any time in its history. Sanskrit was kept alive by a small group of Brahmins for sacerdotal purposes only– not because of the intrinsic interest of the language as such. So the Vedas were a closed book – and chanting only was learned by heart for specific purposes –the grammar or knowing meaning was not considered necessary. Women and all other castes were excluded from even hearing the chants, and of course any “profane ears”. I am sure many on this forum can relate to this. This view still prevails in some communities. James had great difficulty finding anyone to teach him Sanskrit and but finally found a couple of paNDits.
As a result of this knowledge, James loved the language and became its champion. He started the The Asiatic Society, which had Indian members,
and the study of Sanskrit for anyone in the world interested in the language began. This generated widespread interest and the rapid study of many hitherto unknown texts.



I know many Indians want to be believe in a romantic idea of a ‘golden’
past before the British but this is a romance only. There were a lot of undesirable social practises which were promoted by Brahmins (not all of them), which I will not mention here, at that time. Of course in Europe too there were such things. The point is that Sanskrit was never widely spoken, or learnt, nor was education universal (girls were not sent to schools in many parts of the country) so its demise represents current lack of interest in the language. This is the main factor.
