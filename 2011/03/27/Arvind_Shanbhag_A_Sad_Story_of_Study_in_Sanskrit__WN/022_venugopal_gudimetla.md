***\>\>First of all, preservation of traditional methods of learning culture was OUR job, not his.***  
  

True sir, and destruction of a system doing well was also none of his business, but he made it his and looking other way and blaming other reasons, for the sake of blaming is barking the wrong tree. What will you do sir, when you are persecuted in the name of religion, when you are forced to convert to another religion with a sword or bayonet to your neck? and with so much insecurity to live with, you now ask why we didn't hold on to our traditions? why not ask the ones who held the sword to the neck, may be they can answer your question better. Your question would have made sense if through our negligence we ruined our culture. A civilization is like a living organism, it needs constant upkeep, it needs care, it needs to be protected as much as an individual needs protection. I am not saying that we didn't have a part to play in it's degradation, but external factors accelerated it, not acknowledging that is shallow thinking.

  
  
  
***\>\>Secondly, a particular section of society was hit with the same Mr.Maculay. But do not you see many more Madrasas today than Pathshalas?***  
  

Sir, one hand you say we Indians are corrupt, which by the way is an offshoot of poverty at least in our case. Then, where is the question of funding a dying language? how can poverty fund a dying language? what comes first, an empty stomach or revival of almost dead language? you compare Madrasas that are heavily funded by KSA, Pakistan and other mid-eastern islamic nations through the means of petro-dollars that with meager donations from dhatas? and then you say both are hit the same? no sir, Sanskrit was dealt a bad hand for some centuries. First it was Moghuls, the likes of Aurangzeb et al started causing damage even before the great reverend Lord Macaulay showed up. Sanskrit and Hindu Dharma got a double whammy for atleast 4oo years from both islamists and Christian rulers. So you are comparing apples to oranges. And still we haven't woken up and we blame everything else but the perpetrators. It was Macaulay and his gang that drove the final nail...yes he deserves Lordship bestowed to him, why not?
