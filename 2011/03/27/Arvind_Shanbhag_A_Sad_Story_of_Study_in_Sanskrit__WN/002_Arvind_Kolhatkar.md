Ramakrishna Upadrasta observes:  
  
\<…we should also remember ourselves of sad state of Sanskrit education  

in India, as a direct result of Macaulain education or Nehruvian  
policies.>  
  

While agreeing, for the sake of argument, about the ‘sad state of  
Sanskrit education in India’, I see no connection to blame Macaulay or  
Nehru for it. As far as Macaulay is concerned, as brought out by me  
in a recent exchange of postings, he was only trying to explain the  
phrase ‘learned natives of India’ as appearing in the Charter Act of  
1813 and minuted that it should encompass not only those learned in  
the traditional knowledge taught till then but should also include in  
its ambit those trained in modern European sciences and liberal arts.  
I do not think he ever said that traditional knowledge should be  
banished or not taught. He wanted to expand the ambit of ‘knowledge’  
and it is not possible to find any fault with him for it. In fact,  
because of his Minute, education started being imparted through the  
more the more systematic apparatus of schools, colleges and  
universities, entities that, by their institutional nature, are far  
more substantial than the traditional ‘pathshalas’ centered around  
individual scholars and supported by the chance and casual charity of  
philanthropically minded individuals. It is also worth keeping in  
mind that his system opened the doors of education to the masses,  
which doors hitherto were open only to Brahmins and other higher  
castes. This is a fact whose importance cannot be underplayed. We  
now acknowledge that unless the masses are educated, the country is  
not strong. Macaulay was the first one to open the door to it. Let  
us not forget that fact.  
  
Imagine what would have happened had the old system of education,  
prevalent till that time, had continued beyond 1834. By that time,  
all Indian Rajas, Maharajas, Nabobs and sundry other rulers had  
themselves become powerless and supplicants before the British  
Rulers. Again, it is pointless to ‘blame’ the British for it. The  
irresponsible Indian rulers had impoverished India through centuries  
of misrule, had not made any efforts to advance knowledge – the useful  
variety that is – and had not bothered to cast an eye around the world  
to see what was happening elsewhere. Brahmins, the self-appointed  
teachers of the society and so-called pursuers of knowledge,  
themselves hardly knew what ‘knowledge’ really could mean. They were  
more interested in preserving their petty superiority over other  
castes. (As an example. refer to the prodigious efforts put in by the  
Peshwa Court and leading Brahmins of Poona in the last decades of the  
18th century to show to the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus, another  
‘literate’ caste of Maharashtra, how they were really Shudras and  
therefore not entitled to ‘Vedokta’ rituals. All this when the  
Society really should have been united and should have been aware of  
how the British influence was spreading in the country. The same  
‘Vedokta’ affair also reared its head in the early 20th century in the  
Kolhapur Darbar.) When the self-appointed leaders themselves were  
such clueless nincompoops, what else could have happened but that the  
British slowly swallowed the whole country. Do not blame the British  
for it. Blame yourself!  
  
I do not think that, looking backwards, anyone can say that  
introduction of modern education in India was a step in the wrong  
direction. That education brought India into the modern word just as  
the British brought India, kicking and screaming, into the modern  
world. Yes, India paid a price for it through the colonial rule but  
imagine where India would have been today without the modern knowledge  
and the awareness nationhood that it brought with it to us. I daresay  
that, left to drift in the same old way as the pre-19th century days ,  
India would have been an amorphous landmass like today’s Africa, riven  
into tiny pieces and perpetually mired in violence and disorder. It  
is far preferable that India paid the price of colonialism once and  
for all and became a united nation run on modern lines. This is the  
direct consequence of the Macaulayan system.  
  
Even Sanskrit benefitted from it. Study of Sanskrit became much more  
widespread through schools, colleges and universities and many more  
educated persons became aware of its wealth than the few handfuls to  
whom it was confined till the dawn of the 19th century. The glory of  
Ancient India that we so proudly speak of today became known to us  
only after western education brought branches of knowledge like  
archaeology, numismatics, study of old literature to our notice. Our  
learned Brahmins had long forgotten the Brahmi script. Worse still,  
these ‘seekers of knowledge’ had never felt the urge to find out what  
all those thousands of inscriptions, old coins, old ruins lying  
everywhere around them really meant. As an example, it was left to  
James Princep to decipher the Brahmi script and make us aware of the  
glories of Ancient India and the rule of Ashoka. Let us not forget  
what the Macaulayan system has brought to us.  
  
I also do not see why Nehru has been handed a gratuities devaluation.  
What did he do to discourage Sanskrit? It has become fashionable  
these days to blame the Nehruvian thoughts and policies but I think  
his non-alignment and left-of-center approach was the best one for an  
impoverished country that had just emerged from the yoke of  
colonialism. However, I refrain from expanding this line of  
discussion further as it will take us away from Sanskrit.  
  
I do not see any reason for the self-pity perceivable in the so-  
labelled ‘sad state of Sanskrit education in India’. The world  
economies are becoming more knowledge-driven, knowledge here being the  
one that is capable of application to generate wealth and create  
jobs. This is a global phenomenon and none can escape it or reverse  
it. That is why Sanskrit in India, like Latin and Greek in the  
universities in the West, does not enjoy the same pre-eminence that it  
had in previous days. Local languages and liberal arts have been  
similarly affected. The world having become interconnected through  
global commerce, other proud and rich languages like the French are  
reeling under the onslaught of English. This is just the March of  
Time and nothing is gained by lamenting it. If, henceforth a young  
man like Arvind Shanbhag looks to Sanskrit to provide him with a  
guaranteed livelihood, he is likely to meet only with frustration. At  
the end of the day, the country needs and can use only so many  
Sanskrit teachers and professors.  
  
But I do not think that everything is lost. Sanskrit is being saved,  
will be saved and will continue to enjoy its reputation of scholarship  
through efforts of large numbers of enthusiastic amateurs, such as  
members of this Group, who do not depend upon Sanskrit for their daily  
bread. A sufficiently large number of such amateurs, with  
professional and learned Sanskritists at the core, will keep the flame  
burning with sufficient strength for all years to come. This is a  
realistic dream we should be chasing, instead of wailing over the ‘sad  
state of Sanskrit education’.  
  
There are some diehards who want to go beyond this and they would like  
a revival of Sanskrit as a spoken language – if it ever was that. To  
them all I can say is ‘good luck’!
