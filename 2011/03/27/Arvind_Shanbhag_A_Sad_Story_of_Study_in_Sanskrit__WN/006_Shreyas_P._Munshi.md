Respected Arvind-ji,  
Ref your reply to respected Ramkrishna Upadrashta. Your reply begins with:

  
"While agreeing, for the sake of argument, about the ‘sad state of  

Sanskrit education in India’, I see no connection to blame Macaulay..." etc etc.  
  
  
I have been an admirer of your insistence on maintaining an unbiased and objective view while trying to understand Macaulay. In fact, as i've said in my previous mail, your mail virtually woke me up and I am eternally grateful to you for that.  
  
However, I must mention here, that when, in 1949, I was in std VIII in a school in Mumbai, we were taught history of Englan, not of India. We learnt about Alfred the Great, Edgar the Peaceful and other kings of England. Nothing about Indian kings like Vikramaditya, Ashoka and others. I dont know whom we can hold responsible for it. But as it happened (for the better), halfway thru the year, our history syllabus changed to Indian history and the book we started reading was the one by historian Tarachand (in English).  
  
To me it seems that Macaulay was perhaps misunderstood more by the British themselves; and so the educators in charge of India got systematically hell-bent in destroying the 'spiritual and cutural backbone' thinking that that was the recipe recommended by Lord Macaulay! And it was this strayed bunch of educators who perhaps introduced an education system which most Indian believe was the system advocated by Macaulay.  
  
Yes; but i agree, even at a later date, Indians could heve researched and viewed Macaulay in an unbiased manner.It can be done now also, as begun by you.  
Regards...Shreyas
