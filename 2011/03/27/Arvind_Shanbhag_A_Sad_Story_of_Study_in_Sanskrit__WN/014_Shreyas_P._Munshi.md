Respected Venugopal Sir,  
I admire your zeal for Sanskrit and our culture and the Sanatan Dharma. You have brilliantly brought out the causes for the all round downward trend seen in the country today.However, personallyI strongly believe that we can be exploited only to the extent weallow ouselves to be exploited; and so, it would be prudent to do some soul searching ourselves.  
  
If we look at our history, long before Macaulay & Co reached India, Sanskrit as a language had stopped to remain the language of the common man (what in the last two hundred yearsre-kindled interest in Sanskrit is a very good topic  
for study by us: were they the Pundits or MaxMueller or Macaulay or some British govt officials who inspired the people?)and Sanatan Dharma as a religion (or as a way of life as we proudly like to say)had stopped being understood and followed by the masses and that is why some enlighttened souls(and they were royalprinces!)lookedbeyond the Vedas, and Buddhism and Jainism were born; and for the day to daycommunication, languages like Prakrt, ArdhaMaghadi, Pali and others came to be used by the common man. By Almighty's grace (I dont know if there was any otherreason), the Shruti tradition helped in preserving our philosophicaland poetic scriptures in Vedic and classical Sanskrit.  
  
I think, as Swami Chinmayanand used to say, the need of the hour is to convert Hindus to Hinduism! I think the energies shud be directed towards that single goal, if we believe in the Sanatan Dharmal.That done, perhaps,everything could fall in its proper and rightful place, includingSanskrit.  
  
Submitted in all humility...Shreyas

Sir, I am a student too. I am much younger than you are. So no respect needed. I do respect you, I apologize for my brashness. The irony is, at one end, the Brits came, with one pretext or another, they razed to the ground well functioning system, then they built schools modeled on European system that they are familiar and are comfortable with, so that they can carry on "civilizing the savage Indians" with ease and without interruption and now we are alarmed that school don't teach Sanskrit anymore. A system that is modeled on Europen system, is not designed to teach Sanskrit in the first place that too after more than a century of carrying on what Macaulay started, now we suddenly woke up to the reality and blame our schools for it? Yes schools too are to be blamed no doubt for it, but things which got started a century back, can't be done away with all of a sudden. If anything it starts with us. If we educate our kids in Sanskrit at home, that certainly is a good beginning. When I was a kid, a nice gentleman used to run Sanskrit classes for free on Sundays'. Even today many Sanskrit schools are coming up in lot of temples in US too.  
  
Taking pot shots at Indian system wouldn't help for anyone...since this is public forum, let's not forget that it is read by many a foreigner, depicting India in bad light, putting ourselves down is nothing but carrying on the baggage of the British era. My angst is that a prejudiced view of the society for the wrongs done centuries back and putting down India, a cradle of civilization is not a good idea, neither it is positive, nor it is based on truth. Such attacks not only are going to divide us further, they sure are going to hijack truth and merely serve to disrepute Sanatana Dharma.  
  
Regards,  
  
Venugopal Gudimetla
