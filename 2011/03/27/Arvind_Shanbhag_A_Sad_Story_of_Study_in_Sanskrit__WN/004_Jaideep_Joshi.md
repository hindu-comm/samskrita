Dear Kolhatkarji,  
  
(I originally intended to send this mail personally to Kolhatkarji, but then, I thought everyone should atleast be aware of the works of Dharampal. One is then free to see the facts and then make his opinions himself.)  
  
I respect your analysis and your unbiased opinions. At the same time, this same analysis is based on data and history that is made available to us by the British rulers themselves. But there is another unpublished history, * also written by Britishers*: When the east india company first made assessments of India's systems, they sent reports and statistics to the king, which are still preserved in British archives. An analysis of these statistics was carried out around 1980 by Dharampal, and shows a picture quite different from what is taught in our history books.  
  
I shall highlight only a few points relevant to this post:  
  
1) Pathashalas, 1 scholar schools, as you mention, were only for teaching of Vedic studies. Other than that, there were schools in every single village, and they admitted everyone, (including Muslim women!). In fact, 27% of the students were Shudras, and only 23% Brahmin (on the average). Dharampal also gives the list of subjects that were taught in these schools in various grades. (all this of course, from the British archives.) There were colleges also. For that matter, the education system was as systematic as any can be. Most importantly, it was totally autonomous. We are all witnesses to the state of Government run schools today. **For details, please read his book "The Beautiful Tree".**  
  
2) Even upto 17th century, there was significant attitude towards increase of knowledge. Scholars like Neelakantha Somaiyyaji, Bhattoji Diskhita are excellent recent examples. There may have been several Brahmins who were only interested in maintaining superiority, but that does not imply the all society had lost the pursuit of knowledge. For technological achievements of Indians in 18th century, **again read Dharampal Collected Writings: Vol. I**  
  
3) Whatever "good" the Europeans did, they did it after systematically uprooting the existing systems. Examples being the native education system, native steel furnaces, native vaccination system (yes, there was a vaccination system), native Forest management, native village level governance. **Details: Dharampal Collected Writings**  
  
4) You mention that People had no urge to find out what the inscriptions etc meant. That is also not true. Kalhana in 11th century and the author of Kaliyuga Raja Vrittanta in 16-18th century have made efforts to write history by examining inscriptions and coins.  
  
Finally, I do **not** want to project that everything was perfect and that Britishers ruined everything: Yes, the Indians are more responsible for their downfall than the Britishers. They came to rule, so what they did was natural. We, on the other hand, for petty gains, let them divide us, let go of our thousand year old wisdom, and fell prey to them. During the last 200 years, indeed, we degraded to a level never seen before!  
  
Sorry for deviating from the Samskritam theme of the group, but I hope I have atleast presented a few facts which are not accountable in conventional history.  
  
praNAmAni,  
Jaideep.
