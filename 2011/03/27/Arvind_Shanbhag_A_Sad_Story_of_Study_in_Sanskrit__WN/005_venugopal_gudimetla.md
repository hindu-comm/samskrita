Sir Arvind Mahoday,  
  
Reading your mail reminds us Indians why there is a need to get our history correct or get brainwashed by people who rather have opinions and thrust their opinions as facts. From your post it appears you are a great sympathizer of the British.  
  
By conquering India and subjugating it's people. imposing their religion, their system of learning, their culture and plundering it's riches and thrusting an education system that we didn't ask, they didn't do any favour to us. And calling it a favour is anything but arm twisting facts and subverting them for reasons unknown to me.  
  
When the British came to India, India had the one of the best GDPs in the world and had \~25% share of economy of the world.  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_%28PPP%29>  
  
In India 35% to 50% of village lands were revenue free and that revenue was utilised for running schools, conducting temple festivals, producing medicines, feeding pilgrims, improving irrigation etc. The British in their greed brought down the revenue free lands down to 5%.  
  
In the Round- table conference in 1931, Mahatma Gandhi in one of his speeches said, "The beautiful tree of education was cut down by you British. Therefore today India is far more illiterate than it was 100 years ago." Immediately, Philip Hartog, who was a parliamentarian stood up and said, "Mr.Gandhi, it is we who have educated the masses of India. And therefore you must take back your statement and apologise or prove it." Gandhiji said he would prove it. But the debate did not continue for lack of time. Later one of his followers, Shri Dharampal, went to the British museum and examined the reports and archives. He published a book "The Beautiful Tree" where this matter has been discussed in great detail. By 1820, the British had already destroyed the financial resources that supported our educational system- a destruction that they had been carrying out for nearly twenty years. But still the Indians persisted in continuing with their system of education. So, the British decided to find out the intricacies of this system. Therefore a survey was ordered in 1822 and was conducted by the British district collectors. In the survey it was found that the Bengal presidency had 1 lakh village schools, in Madras there was not a single village without a school, in Bombay, if the village population was near 100, the village had a school. Teachers as well as students of all castes were in these schools. The Brahmins accounted 7% to 48% of the teachers, and the rest of the teachers in any district, came from other castes. Further all children had their education in their mother tongue.  
  
  
When you talk of spread of "knowledge" by the British, what "knowledge" do you mean? and how did you conclude that "knowledge" taught in the schools of India at that time is any less than that being taught in the western nations?  
  
and regarding much talked about Macaulay :  
  
The British cut down the financial resources and brought in several regulations one after the other- regulations. They invited T.B. Macaulay to decide how to divert the money, what should be the medium of instruction and the mode of educating the Indian. He made English the medium of instruction and diverted the money for English education. G.D.Trevelyan writes in "Life of Lord Macaulay"(vol 1 pg164) "A new India was born in 1835". What Alexander, Ashoka and the western missionaries had failed to do was accomplished by Macualay's educational minutes, decreeing that India was to receive through English education, the language of the West. "The very foundations of her ancient civilization began to rock and sway. Pillar after pillar in the edifice came crashing down." But Macaulay did a more harmful thing, which is not generally known. **He adopted the "downward filtration method" for educating the Indians. What is this method? The problem facing Macaulay was that Indians were numerous and The British were a handful. How were they going to educate the Indians? How could this nation be weakened so that in self-forgetfulness it would support the British Raj?**  
  
Sir, for understanding an action, we need to understand the intentions behind the action to really understand the action. You stated that :  
  
***..I do not think he ever said that traditional knowledge should be banished or not taught. He wanted to expand the ambit of ‘knowledge’***

***  
and it is not possible to find any fault with him for it.  
  
***

**IN the above statement, You are claiming that the intention of Macaulay is simply to "educate" an Indian out of his benevolence. Could you please explain to us, on what basis you came to that above conclusion sir?, when he in his letter to his father dated 12th Oct, 1836, states clearly his intention of "expanding the ambit of knowledge " :  
  
**"Our English schools are flourishing wonderfully; we find it difficult to provide instruction to all. The effect of this education on Hindus is prodigious. No Hindu who has received an English education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion. It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up, there will not be a single idolater among the respected classes 30 years hence. And this will be effected without our efforts to proselytize; I heartily rejoice in the prospect'**  
  
You state :  
  
***"..It is also worth keeping in mind that his system opened the doors of education to the masses, which doors hitherto were open only to Brahmins and other higher castes. This is a fact whose importance cannot be underplayed. We now acknowledge that unless the masses are educated, the country is not strong. Macaulay was the first one to open the door to it. Let us not forget that fact.*** *"  
*  
Sir, you mean to say that it was Macaulay who opened the doors to other castes? which was till then limited to only Brahmins and that you seem to have taken it to your heart to hold him in high esteem? He was the one started downward infiltration system and what is this system? and what is the intention of this system? here it is:*  
*  
**The downward filtration method was formulated according to which the forward caste (even this was much later) was given preference in schools. To put it in his own words," But it is impossible for us with our limited means to educate all in English. We must at present do our best to form a class of persons Indian in blood and colour but English in tastes, in opinion, in morals, and in intellect.'  
  
**So, to me you seem to state opinions as facts without actually taking the trouble of quoting references to back up your "facts". I pray you please quote us references next time, than passing your opinions as facts.

  
  
***"Brahmins, the self-appointed teachers of the society"  
  
***

Sir, you seem to mean that brahmins appointed themselves as teachers? no sir, it is your opinion, not facts, in fact, the Brahmins accounted 7% to 48% of the teachers, and the rest of the teachers in any district, came from other castes.  
  
  
***"Imagine what would have happened had the old system of education, prevalent till that time, had continued beyond 1834. ...."  
  
***The truth is no one knows what would happen if only the British did never come to India and spread there (sic) system on us. One thing seems to be pretty sure though, millions of Indians wouldn't have become illiterate, nor would India be called a third world nation after maintaining one of the best GDPs from 1AD till the coming of the British. And as far as education would have concerned, since we are playing the imagination game, I would say we would have shown the the world the Indian way of learning than the western way...knowledge need not be called thus only if one studies in an university wearing a well pressed jeans or well pressed suit. For that matter Sri Krishna in Gita says, anything what doesn't lead us to truth is no knowledge at all, going by that definition, western education, exactly doesn't fit the bill. So sir, let imagination just be an imagination, one can't conclude which corner history might have turned through ifs and buts. **** It is only in India that we consider knowledge is true knowledge if it were taught in English, thanks to people who think like you, look at Russians, Japanese, Chinese, who didn't get the Macaulay treatment, yet they have fine institutions, we would have done much better than them ** if not for Macaulay and his cave men.

***  
  
"The irresponsible Indian rulers had impoverished India through centuries of misrule, had not made any efforts to advance knowledge – the useful  
variety that is"  
****  
*

Sir, could you care to explain what this useful variety is? how and why Indian education system was incompetent? and also when you are at it, please do take time to take a glance at the GDP chart and do some "googling" to know what economic position India enjoyed till the thugs came to rape India.  

  
***"Brahmins, the self-appointed teachers of the society and so-called pursuers of knowledge, themselves hardly knew what ‘knowledge’ really could mean.*** "  
  

Again, you seem to have a pretty good grip about this "knowledge" please educate me what this is real education is and why you think it is has to enjoy an exalted state as you seem to place it.  

  
***"The same ‘Vedokta’ affair also reared its head in the early 20th century in the Kolhapur Darbar.) When the self-appointed leaders themselves were  
such clueless nincompoops, what else could have happened but that the British slowly swallowed the whole country.  Do not blame the British  
for it. Blame yourself! "  
**  
*

Sir, even though there were traitors who enabled the fall of Indian civilization, later leading to the plunder of Indian riches and his culture in the name of spreading "a correct variety of knowledge", who can save India, if it's own people propagate "imagined" theories, I would say, intellectual slavery and corruption is of worst kind, for one is damed to be in the darkness. I say that those nincompoops are much better than those who have are intellectually are corrupt.  
  
***"I daresay that, left to drift in the same old way as the pre-19th century days, India would have been an amorphous landmass like today’s Africa, riven***

***  
into tiny pieces and perpetually mired in violence and disorder. It is far preferable that India paid the price of colonialism once and  
for all and became a united nation run on modern lines. This is the direct consequence of the Macaulayan system. "  
  
***

**Sir, as I mentioned above, what do you see common among nations like Japan, China, Russia ? I would say that but for the British thugs, India would have been in even more enviable situation given it's prowess which I am now sure you are not aware off that you unable to fathom it's potential devoid of British way of life. Who needs a system whose intentions are to subjugate, eliminate a way of life? a system which gave birth to people to my surprise can sing eulogies to those thugs who ruined our thriving economy, who ruined our education system, who divided our country in the name of religion? and made it a country of most illiterate, most economically backward nation when they left? and yet you think you are much better under such a system !, am I the only one who is speechless because of your sycophancy?  
  
***"Even Sanskrit benefitted from it. Study of Sanskrit became much more widespread through schools, colleges and universities and many more***..."  
  
You mean to say that by completely eliminating Sanskrit from Indian education system, by propagating "true knowledge" the way you put it, you say it (english education system) benefited Sanskrit? because what now schools and colleges are able to teach Sanskrit? sir, do you really makes sense? how can one system through elimination benefit that which got eliminated? and if it want to benefit Sanskrit, why eliminate it at all in the first place?

  
  
  
***"The glory of Ancient India that we so proudly speak of today became known to us only after western education brought branches of knowledge like archaeology, numismatics, study of old literature to our notice.
Our learned Brahmins had long forgotten the Brahmi script.  
***  

Sir, "our learned Brahmins had long forgotten the Brahmi script" because of lack pf patrons, because people like you trash it, because people like you down play it's importance in the place of some lack lustre foreign maal.

  
  
***  
"Worse still, these ‘seekers of knowledge’ had never felt the urge to find out what all those thousands of inscriptions, old coins, old ruins lying  
everywhere around them really meant. As an example, it was left to James Princep to decipher the Brahmi script and make us aware of the  
glories of Ancient India and the rule of Ashoka. Let us not forget what the Macaulayan system has brought to us.*** "  
  

Sir, foolish think that without them, the world can't make a move, do you think without Einstein, no one would have developed General relativity? no one and nothing can stand in the way of knowledge, if you not Einstein someone else, if not James Princep, someone else, just because a certain James Princep deciphered it, you seem to have come to conclusion that Brahmi script wouldn't have been deciphered at all is fallacious at best. Come one sir, you disappoint me in your reasoning yet again. I have read enough for your line of thought that it doesn't motivate me to read it all...I read enough.  
  
Peace.
