Before going to how Hebrew was revived, two points about Maculay.  
  
First of all, preservation of traditional methods of learning culture was OUR job, not his.  
  
Secondly, a particular section of society was hit with the same Mr.Maculay. But do not you see many more Madrasas today than Pathshalas?  
  
It is about pursuit and identity, as history of Hebrew revival shows.  
  
Hebrew was revered language of much smaller population, had no home land, dispersed in many countries and facing challenges much much worse for a longer time than we did. How was Hebrew revived?  
  
Jews were true believers of Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah. They had one and only one identity - that of a jew. They were none of - Gujarati, or Shaiva or Konkani or Vadama or Bhojpuri or Brahmin - nothing but Jew and did not face conflict of identity. As a first step, gifting a Torah was given a high place. A printed Torah can not be gifted, it has to be hand written. For some, it became a multi year project, for others a life long. But it was a pursuit which a 6 year old saw in the family and those roots were carried till he himself became a grandfather. We know about Kalpana Chawla who lost life in space shuttle. He had a Jew companion. Does anyone know what he carried to Moon? A hand written Torah presented to him. I know about Marathi Jews with well established businesses who did not know, forget English, but even proper Hindi, left everything and left for Israel. That was power of Identity.  
  
Hebrew became national language of Israel came AFTER 100 years of revivalism, on its own without state support.
