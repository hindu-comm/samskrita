Ramakrishnaji,

  

Namaste,

  

A site or forum that will offer career counselling, guidance about job opportunities, etc to Sanskrit students and scholars is a need of the hour. I hope Samskrita Bharati take steps in this direction - it will be easier for SB to do it with their wide network.

  

In the case of Arvind, Bilhana's Vikramankadeva Charitam is available for free at DLI, ISSc, Bangalore. But, he did not have anyone to guide him. Lest he need not have spent his time, energy and money to go to Ujjain just to get a copy of the Sanskrit text of this book.  



regards  
shankara
