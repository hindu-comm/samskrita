Dear Vasuraj,  
  
I have downloaded Dharampal’s book and shall certainly go through it  
and revert back with my 2-paise worth views in due course of time.  
  
I have also seen Prachi Kadam’s write-up on the supposed love of  
Sanskrit that Bollywood is developing. It underscores two facts.  
Firstly, the entertainment columns of newspapers have to be filled up  
every day and inane gossip serves this need very easily. Such gossip  
does not have to be taken very seriously. Secondly. nothing attracts  
attention in India unless it has the name of an entertainment star or  
cricket star associated with it and the smallest thing done by a star  
gets magnified beyond proportion. I do not really know how far Saif  
Ali Khan’s or Sunny Deol’s professed love far Sanskrit will last.  
Even if they were to become real विदग्ध, it would still be just two  
star-lovers of Sanskrit and not the whole Bollywood! One or even two  
sparrows do not make a summer.  
  
My disbelief in the around-the-corner love of Bollywood for Sanskrit  
comes from the fact that what little Sanskrit is heard in Bollywood  
movies, mostly through the type-cast paNDits performing poojas and  
conducting marriage rituals, is so bad that it makes the knowledgeable  
viewer cringe. Yet, nobody in Bollywood seems to notice this. The  
same goes for my mother tongue, Marathi. Names and words that have a  
Sanskrit origin are misspelt in credits in movies and TV shows so  
often, without regard to ह्रस्व, दीर्घ, अनुस्वार, that I feel sure the  
makers of those movies do not know and do not care for the original  
Sanskrit.  
I will say that Sanskrit has entered the entertainment world if the  
Sanskrit film आदि शंकराचार्य can run in cinema theatres for a full  
week. When I saw it in 1983 it was not hailed as a commercial  
success, though it won the best film award of that year.  
  
I think Bollywood is a bad exemplar for Sanskrit and cheers are not in  
order because two stars claim a new-found love for Sanskrit.
