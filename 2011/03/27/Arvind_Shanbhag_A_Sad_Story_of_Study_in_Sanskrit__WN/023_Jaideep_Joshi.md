Dear Vimala MahodayA,  
  
Did you mean William **Jones**?  
  
I would once again request you to read **The Beautiful Tree.** As for William Jones, his attitude towards Sanskrit Pandits is very well reflected in this marble frieze (worth a thousand words) housed at Oxford: <http://www.swaveda.com/articlepicture.php?id=&title=William%20Jones,%20Chapel,%20Oxford%20College&link=images/articles/image_1/william_jones.30102005191131.jpg>  
  
A "Golden Past", however romantic you may want to call it and want to neglect it, is a fact in the face, unless you dont believe British records themselves (in all probablity, are themselves underestimates!). I will quote one sentence from Dharampal:  
  
"By 1930, much had been written on \[British destruction of extensive Indian Education\] in the same manner as had been written on the deliberate destruction of Indian crafts and industry, and the impoverishment of the Indian countryside. However, to many within the expanding strata of westernised Indians -- whether Marxists, Fabians, or capitalist roaders, their views on India and their contempt for it almost equalled that of William Wilberforce, James Mill, or Karl Marx -- such charges seemed farfetched, and even if true, irrelevant." - The Beautiful Tree.  
  
Coming to your points,  
  
\[Sanskrit was kept alive by a small group of Brahmins for sacerdotal purposes only– not because of the intrinsic interest of the language as such. So the Vedas were a closed book – and chanting only was learned by heart for specific purposes –the grammar or knowing meaning was not considered necessary\]  
  
There were 1000+ higher learning colleges in Madras presidency alone, all of which were Sanskrit medium, and taught Veda (the only branch restricted to Brahmins), Music, Astronomy (Ganita Shastra), Law, Shastras etc. The books used consisted of Vedas, Kalidasa's works, Tarka, Dharmashastra, Nyaya, etc.  
  
\[girls were not sent to schools in many parts of the country\]  
  
Of course, because they were taught at home, as were many boys also.  
  
Thus, although it may be true that Sanskrit was no longer the language of the masses, this fact in itself is unsupportive of the conclusions drawn from it, and hence irrelevant.
