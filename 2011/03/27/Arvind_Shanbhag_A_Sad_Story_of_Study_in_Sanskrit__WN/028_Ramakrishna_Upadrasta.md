praNAms,  
  
I am surprised that an offhand remark about made by me has really lead to such discussion, some of it perhaps beyond what I think is the scope of the group. It seemed to be going on and on and the discussion is going strictly into the indology realm IMHO.  
  
First of all, please consider reading this blog of Shantanu, which I had earlier linked, and read the comments for the excellent responses people have given to Shantanu offering help/  
<http://satyameva-jayate.org/2011/03/26/arvind-shanbhag>  
  
The good news is that Shri Vishwas (perhaps the same teacher who appears in the vedios of S.B) and and other kind folk of Samskrita Bharati have offered him some help. (My praNAms to them!)  
  
==  
The above good news cannot be more contrasted with the discussion on this group (I am sorry to say) where opinions are being packaged as facts (as people indoctrinated by a reputed university of India usually do), and when some facts are being shown as counter examples to the opinions, then it is leading to a long winded explanation involving seemingly unnecessary details.  
  
In fact, there are posters who seem to be intent on selling their view of varNAshrama-dharma etc, which has too many insinuations on the scholars and social system of that era that it will lead to long winded discussion unless the moderators act. In my opinion, rebutting these mails is fairly easy, but for other commitments.  
  
==  
  
I request everyone to consider recent posting of Shri Naresh and ask themselves if that particular post is really related to the language element of the devabhaasha, which I think this forum is devoted to. If not, kindly re-consider posting it. In this matter, the 'advaitin' yahoo moderators are wise to point out to the excellent verse 17.15 of Bhagavad Gita:  

  

anudvegakaraM vAkya.n satyaM priyahita.n cha yat.h  
svAdhyAyAbhyasana.n chaiva vAN^mayaM tapa uchyate .. 17.15..  
  
अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत्  
स्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते ॥ १७।१५॥  
  
I could have sent this mail earlier if I was not busy with work (as I am attending a conference soon) and other personal matters.  
namaste  
Ramakrishna
