praNAms,

While most of us are part-time sanskrit students, and are engaging  
ourselves in study of kaumudi or other sanskrit texts, we should also  
remember ourselves of sad state of sanskrit education in India, as a  
direct result of Macaulain education or Nehruvian policies.

In particular, the state of people who study sanskrit to engage in it  
in full time, and thereby become teachers and so on, seems quite  
pitiable.

Here is one such instance from a website I read:
