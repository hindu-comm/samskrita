I don’t really think the marble frieze says anything about Jones’ attitudes – perhaps it says something about Indian attitudes!

I thought you said there were schools in every village before the British. How does one know what was taught or not taught at home?

These Madras colleges were there in British times – so what is the point you were making?

You are entitled to your opinions.
