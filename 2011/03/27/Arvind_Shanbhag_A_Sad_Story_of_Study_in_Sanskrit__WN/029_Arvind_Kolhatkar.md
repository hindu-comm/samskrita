Dear Ramakrishna,  
  
You say:  

  
\<I am surprised that an offhand remark about made by me has really  
lead to such discussion, some of it perhaps beyond what I think is the  
scope of the group. It seemed to be going on and on and the discussion  
is going strictly into the indology realm IMHO.  
  
First of all, please consider reading this blog of Shantanu, which I  
had earlier linked, and read the comments for the excellent responses  

people have given to Shantanu offering help…>  
  
We have, at least I had before responding, already read the referred  

blog of Shantanu and that is why, in my response of March 27, I wrote:  
  
\<I do not see any reason for the self-pity perceivable in the so-  
labelled ‘sad state of Sanskrit education in India’. The world  
economies are becoming more knowledge-driven, knowledge here being the  
one that is capable of application to generate wealth and create  
jobs. This is a global phenomenon and none can escape it or reverse  
it. That is why Sanskrit in India, like Latin and Greek in the  
universities in the West, does not enjoy the same pre-eminence that it  
had in previous days. Local languages and liberal arts have been  
similarly affected. The world having become interconnected through  
global commerce, other proud and rich languages like the French are  
reeling under the onslaught of English. This is just the March of  
Time and nothing is gained by lamenting it. If, henceforth a young  
man like Arvind Shanbhag looks to Sanskrit to provide him with a  
guaranteed livelihood, he is likely to meet only with frustration. At  
the end of the day, the country needs and can use only so many  
Sanskrit teachers and professors.  
  
But I do not think that everything is lost. Sanskrit is being saved,  
will be saved and will continue to enjoy its reputation of scholarship  
through efforts of large numbers of enthusiastic amateurs, such as  
members of this Group, who do not depend upon Sanskrit for their daily  
bread. A sufficiently large number of such amateurs, with  
professional and learned Sanskritists at the core, will keep the flame  

burning with sufficient strength for all years to come. This is a  

realistic dream we should be chasing, instead of wailing over the ‘sad  
state of Sanskrit education’.>  
  

I am delighted that the Shanbhag story has had a happy conclusion.  
  
The later foray into the discussion about Macaulayan and Nehruvian  
influence was occasioned by your remark that the sad state of Sanskrit  
was \<a direct result of Macaulain education or Nehruvian policies.>  
You now express unhappiness about the ensuing (and necessarily long,  
since these cannot be compressed into tweets) discussions.  
परिहासविजल्पितं सखे परमार्थेन न गृह्यतां वचः is what you now say.  
  
I think we do not gather in this forum to exchange fireside banter  
over glasses of sherry – at least I do not – and we take everything  
seriously. I felt that I had to challenge the casually delivered and  
gratuitous insult to Nehru and also to Macaulay. Also, the  
discussion, long or short, is about the so-labelled ‘sad state of  
Sanskrit’ and perceived causes leading thereto and very much belongs  
to this forum.  
  
To the verse  

अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत् \|  
स्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते\|\|  
  

I may reply by another  
सुलभाः पुरुषा लोके सततं प्रियवादिनः।  
अप्रियस्य च पथ्यस्य वक्ता श्रोता च दुर्लभः।  
(अरण्यकाण्ड)
