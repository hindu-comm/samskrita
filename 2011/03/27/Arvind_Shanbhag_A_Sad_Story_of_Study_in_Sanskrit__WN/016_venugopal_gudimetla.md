Respected Jay,  
  
That is so correct, even in Buddhist philosophy, authors like Wei Wu Wei write in parables. He too stresses that, one need not read reams of pages to understand and realize, he says only one word could make you realize the entire meaning of whole universe.  
  
Thanks for sharing the verse.  
  
Regards,
