Sanskrit was not a language of masses any more by the time Britishers came.  
  
And it was inductrial revolution, not Macaulay who set us back. If Industrial revolution had started from India, one of the Indian languages would have been in prominent place across the world.  
  
Why did the Industrial revolution not start in India. Jared Diamond (in book named "Guns Germs and Steel") has AN (I would not say THE) explanation. The society respected Dharmikta and Erudition, not innovation. The fruits of invention had little less value at personal level as it would be shared in the whole extended family. The kings were considered great based on how big temple was built, not whose populace had more prosperity.  
  
How do we blame Macaulay for lack of Civic Sense? Dharm and Bhakti are different and society puts more emphasis on second.ï¿½ As long as I do myï¿½ morning Pooja, I am fine and can bribe the policeman during the day for traffic violation, I do not need to learn Sanskrit, and can blame Macaulay.
