Bhoja Raja was a patron of Sanskrit Poets.

Every day he used to preside over the assembly  
of poets almost every day. One day when the sun was  
about to set, he suggested that they should compose  
some poetry on this.

The firtst poet stood up and said -

परिपतति पयोनिधौ पतंग: /  
The sun falls into the ocean.

The second poet said -  
सरसिरुहामुदरेषु मत्तभृंग: /  
The intoxicxated bee (falls) into  
the stomach of lotus flowers.

The third poet said  
उपवनतरुकॊटरे विहंग: /  
The bird (falls) into the hollow  
of tree in the garden.

The fourth poet who was Kalidasa said -  
युवतिजनॆषु शनै: शनैरनंग: /  
Cupid (the god of love), (falls) slowly  
in the mind of young women.

Bhoja said that there is no poetry  
in what the first three poets said. It was just  
a statement. There was poetry only in  
what Kalidasa said. And he anoounced the  
prize for the poet.
