Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

Bhartihari’s own copy has not come down to us so we can only speculate about the words in the original version.

  

I would suggest that न च्छन्दसा केनचिदुधृतं कुलम् must have been the original as it goes well as a counterpoise to व्याकरण and काव्य of the first two lines. विद्या is too general. A total beliver in छन्दस् could have interpolated the switch, thinking it to be too derogatory to छन्दस्.
