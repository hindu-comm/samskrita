Welcome to your remark. But as it occurs,

  

न च्छन्दसा केनचिदुदुधृतं कुलं goes with the second half,

....................निष्फला गुणाः॥

and

न विद्यया ... .... goes with

...................निष्फलाः कलाः॥

  

There is certain difference in the connotations of the words in changing the reading.
