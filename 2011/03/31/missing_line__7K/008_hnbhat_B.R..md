It is not from the popular शतकत्रय of भर्तृहरि, but a collection of सुभाषित-s, ascribed to him, भर्तृहरि-सुभाषित-संग्रहः, Critically Edited by Prof. D D Kosambi. as per the source given in the सुभाषितभाण्डागार-संग्रह. The verse number too refers to that edition used by the compilers of this sangaraha.

  

By the way, PK Ramakrishnan need not read the blog for the meaning of the सुभाषित. He himself will offer his own explanation. Hence I left it to him.
