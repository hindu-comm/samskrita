நீந்க் ஶிவனேன்னு இருங்கொ

This is how a wife tells her husband.  
She asks him to keep quiet. She  
says that she will attend to what is  
required. This is a very ancient saying.

Siva has no power even to move without  
his other half the Sakti. This idea is brought  
out by Sankaracharya in the first sloka of  
Soundaryalahari.

शिव: शक्त्या युक्तो यदि भवति शक्त: प्रभवितुं  
न चेदेवं देवो न खलु कुशल: स्पन्दितुमपि /
