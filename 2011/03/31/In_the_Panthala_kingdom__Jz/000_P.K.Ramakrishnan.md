There was a poet in Kerala  
who used to compose humorous  
poems. He was very poor.  
He thought of earning something  
by going to the petty kingdom  
of Panthalam. Quite unsuccessful  
in his attempt, he returned and told  
his friend.  
  
राज्ये पंतळभूपस्य  
वासरा हरिवासरा: /  
मत्कुणै: मशकैश्चापि  
रात्रय: शिवरात्रय: //  
  
The days in the Panthala Country  
I spent were Harivasaras.  
  
Harivasara is the Ekadasi day dedicated to Vishnu  
and one fasts throughout the day.  
  
The nights I spent as Sivaratri because of  
bed bugs and mosquitoes. Sivaratri is the night  
once in an year dedicated to Siva and one  
keeps awake throughout the night.
