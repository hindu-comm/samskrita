Sunder-mahodaya very kindly created an alphabetical index of all the sutras in Word/txt and PDF which I am attaching here in case it is of use to others in this group.

The advantage of the Roman script version of course is that it is searchable which I don't think any of the Devanagari versions we have seen on this group - both text and image PDFs - are but correct me if I am wrong.

Thank you again to Sunder for this valuable service.
