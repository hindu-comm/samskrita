The Asthtadhyayi with the Translation of SC Basu is available for download in convenient parts, in addition to Kashika vritti with commentaries, and Mahabhashya too:

The index I have attached herein is from Siddhantakaumudi with Tattvabodhini, available in the same link.

  

I think I can get the Balamanorama Ashtadhyayi Sutrasuchi from my library soon. The above index can be used with Basu's Translation too. which doesn't have Index, but based on Kashika. 

  

A plain Sutrapatha is too attached which is made available in Sanskrit Documents List link above by our esteemed member dej.vaidya.

  

Hope these two will be enough for the time being.

  

With regards
