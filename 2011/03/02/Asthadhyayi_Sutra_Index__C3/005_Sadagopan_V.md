Thank you for giving the link to sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg. I could use the search facility in the site using Kyoto-Harvardsystem of transliteration.For example I can browse the Sutrapaatha, Dhatupaatha, Pratyaya list, etc. But I dont know howto google with sanskrit so that I can exactly land in the Sutra-text available in the database, as mentioned by you in your email message. Can I input a string in Kyoto-Harward transliteration system and search for the Sutra that would contain the said string in it?

I shall be thankful if you would kindly help
