Can anybody download and get the link in another site?

  

I have problems with downloading from DLI. I to would like to have that as e-book.

  

The objective is of an Word Index of the Ashtadhyayi with the texts of accessaries too with Ashtadhyayi Sutra Patha (with Vartika).

  

I too had noticed it, but could not download it.

  

With regards and thanks in advance.
