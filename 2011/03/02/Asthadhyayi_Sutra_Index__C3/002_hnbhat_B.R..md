Here you can search online in the database:

  

<http://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Panini/HTML/>

  

[](http://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Panini/HTML/)provided by our esteemed member Sai.surala.

  

If you know the Sutra, by googling with sanskrit you can exactly land in the Sutra-text available in the database in other sites too. If you want just Index of the Ashtadhyayi of the particular edition, some member may be able to scan and send the pages.
