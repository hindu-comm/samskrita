You can use Google Transliteration system online available.

  

<http://www.google.com/transliterate/>

  

or Baraha IME from the Baraha software full download:

  

<http://www.baraha.com/download.htm>

  

or stand alone application like google transliteration from this link:

  
<http://rapidshare.com/files/109344208/Baraha_IME.zip>

  

Just chose the language in both (gogle Transliteration chose and download and after instalation chose) Sanskrit language and start typing in any application browser message or search engine. Typing अतो दीर्घो यञि you will land in the document by googling. Try right click and search by google (in chrome browser) and you will land in the exact location of Ashtadhyayi on the web pages of the Sutra.

  

Hope you will benefit with this. With regards
