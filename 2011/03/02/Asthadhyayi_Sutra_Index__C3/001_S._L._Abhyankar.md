नमो नमः "वेनेशिया"-महोदये !  
  
I had downloaded a 48-page list of all the sutra-s from <http://sanskritdocuments.org>  
  
I am attaching the pdf-file - just 286 K. It is in a way the index. But much more than an index, because it is the complete text !  
  
However I am keen to have an index where sutra-s are segregated by their subjects. For example, I am keen to see all sutra-s related to samhita (sandhi-niyama) indexed together or all sutra-s related to various types of samaasa indexed together.  
  
Actually, in as much as there are 4 quarters of each of the eight adhyAya-s, I am wondering what is the title of each adhyAya and of each quarter thereof. There must have been some logic in the layout of different sutra-s into total 32 quarters. I do not know whether that logic has been deciphered.  
  
Yours is hence a very good question ! Many thanks for raising this !
