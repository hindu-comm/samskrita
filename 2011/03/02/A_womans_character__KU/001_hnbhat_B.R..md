It is from Aranyakanda of Valmiki Ramayana:

  
एषा हि प्रकृतिः स्त्रीणामासृष्टे रघुनन्दन!।  
समस्थमनुरज्यान्ति विषमस्थं त्यजन्ति च।।3.13.5।।  
  
रघुनन्धन! beloved son of Raghu dynasty, आसृष्टेः from the begining of this creation, एषा this is, स्त्रीणाम् of women, प्रकृतिः by nature, समस्थम् all is well and smooth going, अनुरज्यन्ति will keep them happy, विषमस्थम् in hard situations, त्यजन्ति च will give up.  
  
O Rama the beloved son of Raghu dynasty! From the begining of the creation women by nature would keep their husbands happy when all is well and smooth going and give up their company when they face hard situations.  
  
शतह्रदानां लोलत्वं शस्त्राणां तीक्ष्णतां तथा।  
गरूडानिलयोश्शैघ्र्यमनुगच्छन्ति योषितः।।3.13.6।।
