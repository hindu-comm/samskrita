Namaste Sir,



"रघुनन्धन! beloved son of Raghu dynasty, आसृष्टेः from the begining of this creation, एषा this is, स्त्रीणाम् of women, प्रकृतिः by nature, समस्थम् all is well and smooth going, अनुरज्यन्ति will keep them happy, विषमस्थम् in hard situations, त्यजन्ति च will give up.

O Rama the beloved son of Raghu dynasty! From the begining of the creation women by nature would keep their **husbands** happy when all is well and smooth going and give up their company when they face hard situations."



Could you please tell me where is Sanskrit word for husband in this verse. I think this is for those women who behave in an uncontrolable way and have romantic relationships with many without marrying them. This happens, perhaps, when we behave in undisciplined way. The married cases of such type are not reported much in our history. Indians have always been lucky in having 'pativrataa' wives, at least more than the western people. So, the wives like Sita should always be appreciated and imitated. And I think we get faithful wives when our karmas of previous birth are ok. If one have been in her previous birth a faithful wife and in this birth that wife is a man, then I think he is most likey to get a wife like Sita, due to his good karmas of previous birth. So we should not say that women are bad but should say that our karmas of previous birth(s) were not good so now we are having such wicked women due to our bad karmas of previous birth. I think this is the right explanation of bad and good women! Otherwise that would be simply unjustifiable reproach of women.



Sorry to intrude.



With humble regards,

Madhav
