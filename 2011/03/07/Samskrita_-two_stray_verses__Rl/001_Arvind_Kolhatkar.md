I know another version of this verse, though I too am unaware if it  
has an identifiable source. Possibly, it is one of those thousands of  
'orphan' verses whose parentage is lost.

पथ्ये सति गदार्तस्य भेषजग्रहणेन किम्।  
पथ्येऽसति गदार्तस्य भेषजग्रहणेन किम्॥

In a slightly different direction, the following is an आर्या, and  
therefore possibly of Moropant, which, like the भेषज verse, is a  
Marathi example of संपूर्ण यमक. It is less poetry and more exhibition  
of mastery over vocabulary and one indeed has to perform verbal  
acrobatics to decipher it. This is how it goes:

अनलसमीहित साधी राया वारा महीवरा कामा।  
अनलस मीहि तसा धीरा यावा रामही वराका मा॥

अन्वय - महीवरा राया, (जसा) वारा अनल-समीहित साधी, तसा (हे) धीरा, अनलस  
मीहि कामा यावा. (तदनंतर) रामहि (आणि) वराका मा (कामा येतील).

अर्थ - O King, the best in the world, just as the wind aids the fire,  
so, O brave one, I shall be untiring and will help you. (After that,  
it will but follow) that Balaraama and poor Laxmi will do likewise.  
(KriShNa promising assistance to the PaaNDavaas said this.)
