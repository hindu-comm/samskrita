Thnaks. The fact that two different persons of different origin have come  
across the same verse albeit in different versions proves the antiquity and  
popularity of the verse.  
The second verse might be in a some later work of grammar.  
It is indeed surprising that Marathi is also amenable to constructing such  
verses. I have read that there are such verses, belonging to Chitrakavya  
category, even in Kannada although I have not read them myself.
