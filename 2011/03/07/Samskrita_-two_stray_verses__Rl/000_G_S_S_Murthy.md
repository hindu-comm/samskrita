Dear all,  
I learnt the following verse from an elderly scholar of my village during my boyhood:  
पथ्ये सति गदार्तस्य किमौषदिनिषेवणैः ।  
पथ्येऽसति गदार्तस्य किमौषधिनिषेवणैः ॥  
Where is the need for medicines if one is following strict diet? Of what avail is any medicine if one does not adhere to his diet?  
  
I learnt the following from my Sanskrit teacher:  
अनधीते महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी ।  
अधीते तु महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी ॥  
If one has studied Mahabhashya, there is no need to study Padamanjari. If one has not studied Mahabhashya there is no use of studying Padamanjari. (An acerbic comment indeed!)  
  
I would be obliged if any of you could identify the sources of these verses. They do not seem to be included in सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागारम् .  
  
Regards  
Murthy
