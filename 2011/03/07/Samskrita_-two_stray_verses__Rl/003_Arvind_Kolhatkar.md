Yet one more verse in the same category, origin unknown. It cannot be  
more that 300 or 400 years old as it refers to tobacco, introduced by  
the Portuguese into India from South America.

तमाखुपत्रं राजेन्द्र भज माऽऽज्ञानदायकम्।  
तमाखुपत्रं राजेन्द्र भज माज्ञानदायकम्॥

अन्वय - तमाखुपत्रं राजेन्द्र भज मा अज्ञानदायकम्। तं आखुपत्रं राजेन्द्र  
भज मा-ज्ञानदायकम्॥

O King, do not be an addict for tobacco leaf as it leads to  
ignorance. O King, worship the One whose carrier is the mouse and who  
bestows prosperity and knowledge.
