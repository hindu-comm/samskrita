Thiruthiru,

  

I did not try the Unicode to shreelipi converter. But, I tried the Unicode to Sanskrit 99 converter. It worked perfectly well.  

There are different converters on that site for conversion from Unicode to Shreelipi. Did you try them all? I think it will be worth trying.

  

Another suggestion: You could try using Sanskrit98 or Sanskrit 99 True Type Fonts. They are very beautiful too and will work in Pagemaker. As I said earlier, conversion from Unicode to Sanskrit99 is very easy and without any errors.  



regards  
shankara
