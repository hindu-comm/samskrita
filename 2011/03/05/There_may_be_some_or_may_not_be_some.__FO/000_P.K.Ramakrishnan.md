There may be some people in any  
group who answer to this description.  
There may not be also.  
Probably I may be one such.

When I quote some thing,  
I try to give and chapter and  
verse. There are some which  
I quote from memory. I have  
not quoted so far which is my  
own creation.

From Mundakopanishad

अविद्यायामन्तरे विद्यमाना  
स्वयं धीरा: पण्डितं मन्यमाना: /  
जङ्घन्यमाना: परियन्ति मूढा:  
अन्धॆनैव नीयमाना यथान्धा: //

Steeped in ignorance, yet  
thinking themselves wise and  
learned, fools wander about  
suffering again and again,  
like the blind led by the blind.
