Dear Arwind Mahodaya  
The drama is very interesting and there is a commentator in the middle  
discussing the significance of it. To me some of the dancing looks like  
Kathak and some looks like folk dancing. What re the traditions you  
mentioned - Arya, Saki, Dindi, Abhang, Keertan, Lavni and where can read up  
about those?
