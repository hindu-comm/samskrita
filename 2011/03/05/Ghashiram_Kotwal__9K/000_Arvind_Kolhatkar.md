Dear Group,  
  
A few days ago, I had mentioned the late Vijay Tendulkar's celebrated  
play 'Ghashiram Kotwal' in the context of 'Ramana' in the second half  
of the 19th century in Pune. I am happy to say that the whole play  
(2h 49m in one go) is available on youtube at <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWAala0AugY>  
  
It depicts the Brahminical Pune of that time. The presentation of the  
play is very original, with stylized movements, prose rendered like  
rhythmic poetry, and all music and choreography in the form of  
traditional Marathi forms of Arya, Saki, Dindi, Abhang, Keertan, Lavni  
(Tamasha) etc. If you would, it is worth watching.  
  
The playwright, the music composer (Bhaskar Chandawarkar), the  
choreographer (Krishndev Mulgund) and some of the original actors,  
including Ramesh Tilekar who played Ghashiram in the original version  
of the 1970's, have left this world. I had seen the original version  
directed by Jabbar Patel, with Mohan Agashe as Nana Phadnavis in the  
Shriram Kala Kendra's annual drama fest in Delhi in 1975 and the  
audience, many of whom were not Marathi speakers, found it spell-  
binding.  
  
The version on youtube is with new actors but is otherwise faithful to  
the original and is almost as good as the original. Additionally, it  
has some English subtitling, though of a less than satisfactory  
quality. The play, however, is not carried so much by the dialogue as  
by the style of presentation and not following the dialogue fully will  
not be much of an impediment.  
  
I hope you will enjoy this...
