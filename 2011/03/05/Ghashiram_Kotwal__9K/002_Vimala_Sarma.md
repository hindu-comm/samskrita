Arvind Mahodaya, Thanks for this link.  
I had a quick look at the beginning but like a lot of these things with good  
poetry, music and etc are marred somewhat by the intro which has an  
exaggerated claim: "the social circumstances ........go beyond time and  
space" (Nothing goes beyond time and space!) and the Ganesha mask which  
looks makes its look less (like a school panto production) than it deserves.  
Maybe Ganesha mudras (suggesting the character) would suffice. I suppose I  
am looking at it as a Westerner would! I have not seen the rest and will  
when I get the time. The drumming sequences are excellent and some of those  
patterns have been put to Kuchipudi bolls.  
Best wishes  
Vimala
