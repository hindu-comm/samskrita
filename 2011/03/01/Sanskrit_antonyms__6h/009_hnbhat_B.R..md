Thank you for the rare Sahasranama in the alphabetical order. Very interesting. Seems to be the objective to represent him as Akshara-svarupa, and the thousand names comprising the letters of the alphabet obviously mentioned in the beginning verse in the same order of the alphabet:

  

"mAt RukAmAlikAyuktam" 

  

Very much interesting.
