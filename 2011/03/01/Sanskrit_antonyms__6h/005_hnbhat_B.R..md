There is one strange "sahasranama" starting with the 24 letters in order ending with the names beginning with "hi". Gayatri Sahasranama.

  

In naanaarthavarga, the words are arranged not in topic wise, but in alphabetical order or the endings of the stem in the Naanarthavarga, or special dictionaries for naanaarthakosha-s. But not arranged in the order of the words beginning with. Their purpose was different as in the case of Amarakosha. Almost every text was to be memorized, including the Amarakosha, which is one of the source of building vocabulary. Not used as a reference book for meaning to be looked into in the alphabetical order and composed in verses rather to facilitate memorize them. The advantage is that when you read the text you need not refer to any dictionary, if you are equipped with Kosha and VyakaraNa. Accordingly they were composed not in metrical structure, and not in their objective was give an alphabetical index or dictionary as in the present time, when the learning system has changed drastically.

  

Most of the learning was done from a teacher and only after completion of the course, further reading would be acquired in different steps:

  

> आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते पादं शिष्यः स्वमेधया।  
> पादं सब्रह्मचारिभ्यः पादम् कालक्रमेण च॥  
> ācāryāt pādamādatte pādaṁ śiṣyaḥ svamedhayā\|  
> pādaṁ sabrahmacāribhyaḥ pādam kālakrameṇa ca\|\|  
>   
> A student gets a quarter (knowledge) from his teacher,a quarter by > his own intelligence.  
> A quarter from his fellow students and a quarter in due course of > time.  
>   
> Only 1/4th of his learning is to be completed from outside his > gurukula. There too, another system was prevalent:

  

गुरुशुश्रूषया विद्यापुष्कलेन धनेन वा। अथवा विद्यया विद्या चतुर्थी नोपलभ्यते ॥

[TABLE]

  

While they set out of the gurukula, each will be well-equipped with vyakaraNa and KoSha. Jagaddhara, the commentator of Bhavabhuti's works, calls himself as Kosha-vallabha, who quotes profusely synonyms from different Kosha-s in support of his interpretation. And this was the method of teaching too. Commentator Mallinatha, declares that:

  

नामूलं लिख्यते किंचित् नानपेक्षितमुच्यते॥

  

Without supporting his interpretation, nothing will be said without testimony to support which mainly depend on the resources Kosha

and VyakaraNa.

  

I can see many responding to this answer. Hence I am not elongating this reply. Keerthi Naresh is quite right in the response.

  

Thanks for raising the issue and the responses there to.
