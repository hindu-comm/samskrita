I am afraid there is not. I have not heard any such name. There are only specialized dictionaries, Ekakshara, dvyakshara, nannartha etc. Generally polynyms are included in the General lexicons of synonyms.

  

It is too difficult to have such one exactly antonyms. Even the negative formation with the particle "na" yields six types of meanings.

  

"तत्सादृश्यमभावश्च तदन्यत्वं तदल्पता। अप्राशस्त्यं विरोधश्चनञर्थाःषट् प्रकीर्तिताः। "

  

and some have both the meanings inside the word. Like,

  

"आराद् दूरसमीपयोः"(Amara 3.3.242c) "सव्यं दक्षिणे वामे च" (हैमः) "सव्यं दक्षिणवामयोः" (वैजयन्ती) etc.

  

Well, if somebody has compiled such one, might have been better.

  

With regards
