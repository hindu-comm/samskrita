"Somehow this simplest of ideas did not occur to anyone in hundreds ofyears of learning. What could be the reason for this?"

  

DISCLAIMER: My comment is purely from a logical point of view. I am not rising to the defense of members of the learned community of yore.

  

Let us not lose sight of the forest in looking at the trees! In today's system of learning, starting from letters of the alphabet and building words and then sentences, this (alphabetic sequencing of words in a dictionary) of seems to be a good approach. But this is in-fact, reverse-engineering.

  

Language (natural) does not evolve that way. You start with sounds, and concepts. Words are formed around those. Also, look at the learning process - today, we learn from a dictionary. Earlier, knowledge was gained from listening and repeating. You learnt (memorized, rather) a whole lot by this method, starting at a young age. Later, as the student got older, he started learning the mechanics of the language, and by this time, he had a huge database in his mind that he could resort to for examples, illustrations .... The koshas collated that knowledge in a modular manner.

P.S.: Recently, at work, I was handed a (printed) year-end sales report of customers' transactions sorted in alphabetic order of their customer code. Customer code had itself been created chronologically (without any reference to the alphabet in the customer's name). You can imagine my sense of disbelief at the thought process of the person who generated that report!  (Blind alphabetic sequence of something which did not make any sense!)
