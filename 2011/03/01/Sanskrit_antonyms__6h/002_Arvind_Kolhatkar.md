I do not think that such a dictionary was created by anyone. Even the  
शब्दकोषs that are extant are actually thesauri and not alphabetical  
dictionaries of the modern type.  
  
I would say that, looking at it from the modern perspective, our old  
scholars were not very good at organizing and presenting information.  
For example, arranging words alphabetically now appears to us to be  
the easiest way of reaching a word we want to know the meaning of.  
Somehow this simplest of ideas did not occur to anyone in hundreds of  
years of learning. What could be the reason for this?  
  
Occasionally we do see alphabetical arrangements as, for example, in  
विष्णुसहस्रनाम but even there it is not very consistent.
