Sri.Bhat Mahodaya,

  

Just wanted to share these.

  

I found Gayathri sahasranamas which you have mentioned here:

  

<http://www.ambaa.org/pdf/gAyatrI_Worship.pdf>

  

The one from devi bhagavatham - Pages 27 to 40 are in alphabetical order and the one from Rudra Yamala from pages 59 to 72 are in 24 alphabet sequence of Gayathri mantra.

  

Suvarnamala stuti by Bhagavat pada is another one which came to my mind.

  

namaskarams

Ramesh
