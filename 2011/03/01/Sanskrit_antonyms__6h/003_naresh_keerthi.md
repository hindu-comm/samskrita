Could this be because the alphabetic order didn't exist in the Indian tradition.  
  
The roman script in which we write English has a totally arbitrary arrangement of alphabets, which we are made to memorise for no particular reason. What pray is the logical scheme underlying the alphabetic 'order' ? It isn't an order, it is a prescription.  
  
The SanskRt letters were clustered according to the site of origin or site of articulation - kaNTa, tAlU, mUrdhA etc, and this is at least as old as the prAtishAkhya-s. Phonologists and linguists have been unanimous in praising this arrangement.  
  
The Indian lexicons with a topic-based arrangement of lexical entries reflect the mind better than our dictionaries that are alphabetical.We don't think alphabetically, we think in clusters of allied thoughts and the words corresponding to them.  
  
Also the Indian Lexicons weren't meant for weak memories like ours', which need the lexicons as reference books and ready reckoners, they were learnt by rote, in the rigourous course of shIksha, that every student underwent.  
  
Those who have seen scholars list out synonyms, will see that they effortlessly remember the entries from a half-dozen kosha-s; and testify the merit of that scheme.  
  
  
Best,
