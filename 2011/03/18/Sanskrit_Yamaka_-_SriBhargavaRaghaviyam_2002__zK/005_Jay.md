From Wikipedia...

This is from Kiratarjuniyam

  

The work is known for its brevity, depth (*arthagauravam*), and verbal complexity. At times, the narrative is secondary to the interlaced descriptions, elaborate metaphors and similes, and display of mastery in theSanskritlanguage.^([\[8\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir%C4%81t%C4%81rjun%C4%ABya#cite_note-winternitz-7))Notably, its fifteenth canto contains*chitrakavya*, decorative composition, including the fifteenth verse with "elaborate rhythmic consonance"^([\[11\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir%C4%81t%C4%81rjun%C4%ABya#cite_note-10))noted for consisting of just one consonant:^([\[5\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir%C4%81t%C4%81rjun%C4%ABya#cite_note-warder-4)[\[12\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir%C4%81t%C4%81rjun%C4%ABya#cite_note-11)[\[13\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir%C4%81t%C4%81rjun%C4%ABya#cite_note-12))
