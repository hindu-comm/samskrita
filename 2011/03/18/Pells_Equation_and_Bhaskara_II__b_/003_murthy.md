Probably what goes by the name "Brahmagupta's theorem" did not have any association with any other person and hence once it was recognized that Brahmagupta's works contain the theorem it woukd have been named after him. In this case however as Pell's name is associated changing it would be more difficult and would encounter inertia. Similarly Fibonacci sequence alsomay need tobe renamed as "Gopala sequence".
