The fact that Bhaskara's Chakravala method leads to solutions for Pell's  
equation is well researched and accepted by mathematicians, I believe. The  
book by Dr. Varughese -I may be excused if I have not spelled his name  
correctly- title of which I forget (Word "peacock" occurs in the title if I  
remember it right) dicusses this and there is much info on web too.  
As usual giving credit through naming has inherent "social drags".

Subject: \[Samskrita\] Pell's Equation and Bhaskara II

  
Dear Group,

An equation of the type

Nx^2+1=y^2 or  
y^2-Nx^2=1 (where N, x and y are +ve integers)

is traditionally called Pellï¿½s Equation. Bhaskar II, building on the

  
earlier work of Brahmagupta and others, has given in his BeejagaNita a  

method called ï¿½Chakrawalaï¿½ for any value of N and has shown that for

  
N=61, y=1766319049 and x=226153980 is the smallest solution of the  
equation. In other words

(1766319049)^2 - 61\*(226153980)^2 = 1

Anyone can verify this by using the Calculator available in the  
Accessories menu of the computer. It was also known that once a  

solution is found for a Pellï¿½s Equation, infinitely many more

  
solutions can be found by the iterative process.

This work done in India was not known to the Europeans. The so-called  

Pellï¿½s Equation makes its first appearance in Europe in 1657 when

  
Fermat (of the Last Theorem fame) challenged his contemporary  
mathematicians in Europe and England to solve the very problem,  
y^2-61x^2=1 that Bhaskara had mentioned in BeejagaNita, though even  
the existence of the earlier work done in India was unknown in  
Europe. How the very problem noticed and solved by Bhaskaracharya  
reached to Fermat is not known. European mathematicians were able to  
develop other methods to solve the problem.

Pell, an otherwise little known mathematician, has been immortalized  
by having his name attached to the equation, which honour, we now  
know, rightfully belongs to Bhaskaracharya. Pell got his name  
attached to the equation because Euler, another giant of European  
mathematics, called it so, mistakenly believing that the work was  

Pellï¿½s when it was really done by another well-known mathematician,  
Brouncker.

For a more detailed discussion of the history of this problem and of  
the older Indian contribution, please visit
