Thanks Vimala-ji. I am quite relieved!  
  
You see, I am trying to learn spoken Sanskrit in the Chitrapur Mutt stream. I have cleared the two initial courses: Upaasanaa and Aaraadhanaa; Saadhanaa and DhaaraNaa would be the 3rd and the fourth (final) level.  
  
About 'to celebrate',I asked my teachers and some university level Sanskrit teachers also and they all said that exact translation of 'to celebrate' is not available. And that is why I placed the query to the fraternity. And after reading Prof Bhat's line, attempted to innovate the secular-sounding verb 'sam+mud samodate", all the time remaining scared (I am still scared!)that it might amount to an affront on the Sanskrit language.  
  
I cant agree more with the scholars who have said that the verb to be used for 'to celebrate' would depend on the context; but today we have come to use 'to celebrate' for almost all situations (and in almost all cases, the method of celebrating also remains the same;"cheers", drink, dance, laugh, make noise and the like),the acquired connotation boiling down to "let's get together and enjoy", whether it is a Grand Slam Victory as Vidya-ji has said, or others like: passed the exam, bought a new house, bought my first car, got engaged, got married, got blessed with a child, got elected, got promoted, birth or marraige anniversary, 400 yrs of creation of Hyderabad etc....let's celebrate!  
  
The cultural context also seems to have got replaced. I am 74, but I never said 'happy birthday' to my late mother or father! And never never 'happy marriage anniversary'to them! And never said "let's celebrate"! Whether it was their birthday or mine, it was I who would bow down to them (and all my elders!)for their blessings. Things have now surely changed.My children and nephews and nieces wish us happy birthday, happy marriage anniversary, and offer "to celebrate"! So next time I would say (not to show off my newly learnt Sanskrit but to inspire them to learn spoken Sanskrit!):  
"avaShyam sammodiShyamahe"!  
Regards...Shreyas

Subject: Re: Re: \[Samskrita\] Sanskrit verb for "to celebrate"Respected Prof Bhat Sir,

  
Thank you very much. Refering to your line:  
"One may invent some verbs, but I am not sure. For celebration or" etc  
Can we then innovate (from 'mud modate'), a new verb 'sam+mud sammodate' to convey 'to enjoy or rejoice together'? Will it convey 'to celebrate'? Will it amount to an affront to the Sanskrit language?  
Daasye, modiShye etc convey individual rejoicing and so I thought 'sammodiShye' could convey 'rejoicing together which would seem to be the essence of 'to celebrate'.  
Regards...Shreyas

I too do not believe, that any of the Sanskrit verbs noted by the machine made translations are based on the Sanskrit English Dictionaries, and do not confirm with the definition of the verb "to celebrate" as given in the English Dictionaries,  
  

\[IorT\]to take part in special enjoyable activities in order to show that a particular occasion is important  
We always celebrate our wedding anniversarybygoing out to dinner.  
  
If this plan works, we'll celebratein style(=in a special way).--  
The verbs by themselvesष्टु स्तुतौ स्वादिः,ष्टुञ्स्तुतौ' २. ३८ प्र + ऋच् = स्तुतौ, are clearly used to express to praise, as in स्तोत्रम्, स्तुतिः,स्तवनम् etc. give explicit meaning.

  
  
प्र +ऋच् \| तु० सेट् प० स्तुतौ' ६. २२ \|\|  
ऋच् \| तु० सेट् प० \|गतीन्द्रियप्रलयमूर्तिभा वेषु६. १६ \|\|  
प्रथ् \| भ्वा० सेट् आ० \| प्रथँ' (म्)प्र' ख्याने' १. ८६९ \|;too have the same effect, in practice., प्रथयति, प्रथा, ख्यातिः = popularity, praise, fame. to be extolled, praised. etc. would be most possible meanings for these. "ख्या प्रकथने" to speak. विख्यातः = praised by many people because of his deeds.  
This gives some hint of being celebrated persons and hence the equation with the english verb to celebrate. I don't think we have any simple verb exactly meaning the same as the english verb = to celebrate.:  
  

1.Behave as expected during holidays or rites;2.Have a celebration;3. Assign great social importance to

  
Just I copied what I found on the net with the dictionaries. One may invent some verbs, but I am not sure. For celebration or festivity, in general, there is a commonly used word उत्सव derived from the verb :सू \| तु० सेट् प० \| षू प्रेरणे ६. १४४ \|\|  
but the verbal forms are not known. सुवति will be normal one, but not used in the sense of celebrate much, as its noun form is used.  
Open for further opinions from other learned members.
