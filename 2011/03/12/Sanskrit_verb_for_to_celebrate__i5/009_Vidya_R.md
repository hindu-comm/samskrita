"Most of them are contextual meanings, and outside the context, it is doubtful whether they would convey the same meaning as the cultural content of the verb to celebrate in the classical literature." - Well said.

'context' is the name of the game. When asking for a translation, it is better if the requester specifies a context. Celebration of a Grand Slam victory is different from celebrating Diwali. Which is again different from the celebration of the life and works of some noble soul.
In English itself, though the word is the same, a different 'sense' is conveyed based on what is being celebrated. And then, to find a single equivalent in another language (Sanskrit, in this case), even without analyzing what thescope of the meaning of the word in the original language is, will not do justice to the effort.

  

Respectfully,

  
Vidya
