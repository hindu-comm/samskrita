Respected Prof Bhat Sir,  
Thank you very much. Refering to your line:  
"One may invent some verbs, but I am not sure. For celebration or" etc  
Can we then innovate (from 'mud modate'), a new verb 'sam+mud sammodate' to convey 'to enjoy or rejoice together'? Will it convey 'to celebrate'? Will it amount to an affront to the Sanskrit language?  
Daasye, modiShye etc convey individual rejoicing and so I thought 'sammodiShye' could convey 'rejoicing together which would seem to be the essence of 'to celebrate'.  
Regards...Shreyas
