I think they are from the output page itself when the formatting is removed for compactness in the message. Could you see my next message, without removing the format from the output page?

  

I think there are some problems with the mailing list too as some member had complained earlier. None of us were to see or read his messages. I think it is not the same in this case. I am not sure. I had heard the same complaint in some other fourm that Unicode encoded Devanagari fonts are not readable in her computer or mail-client. Naresh may solve it if it persists.

  

With regards
