Welcome to your innovation.

  

It can be always remembered the episode in Krishna's life cost his life itself, if you believe the Puranic episode. Even the dependents of Krishna were not saved from the alcholic incidence by the name of Krishna. This is the phala-stuti of Krishna's kavaca-mantra:

  

रोगविघ्नहतश्चैव ब्रह्महागरुतल्पग: ॥  
स्त्रीहत्याबालघाती च सुरापी वृषलीपति: ।

मुच्यते सर्वपापेभ्यो य: पठेन्नात्रसंशय: ॥

  

It doesn't mean one who is drinking only should be seeking relief from all kinds of sins by reciting the stotra of Krishna. Anyhow it is your choice.
