I too do not believe, that any of the Sanskrit verbs noted by the machine made translations are based on the Sanskrit English Dictionaries, and do not confirm with the definition of the verb "to celebrate" as given in the English Dictionaries,

  

\[IorT\]to take part in special enjoyable activities in order to show that a particular occasion is important  
We always *celebrate our wedding anniversarybygoing out to dinner*.  
If this plan works, we'll celebratein style(=in a special way).--

  

The verbs by themselves*ष्टु स्तुतौ स्वादिः,**ष्टु*ञ्*स्तुतौ*' २. ३८ प्र + ऋच् = स्तुतौ, are clearly used to express to praise, as in स्तोत्रम्, स्तुतिः,स्तवनम् etc. give explicit meaning.

  

प्र +ऋच् \| तु० सेट् प० स्तुतौ' ६. २२ \|\|  

ऋच् \| तु० सेट् प० \|गतीन्द्रियप्रलयमूर्तिभा वेषु६. १६ \|\|

प्रथ् \| भ्वा० सेट् आ० \| प्रथँ' (म्)प्र' ख्याने' १. ८६९ \|;

too have the same effect, in practice., प्रथयति, प्रथा, ख्यातिः = popularity, praise, fame. to be extolled, praised. etc. would be most possible meanings for these. "ख्या प्रकथने" to speak. विख्यातः = praised by many people because of his deeds.

This gives some hint of being celebrated persons and hence the equation with the english verb to celebrate. I don't think we have any simple verb exactly meaning the same as the english verb = to celebrate.:

  

1.Behave as expected during holidays or rites;

2.Have a celebration;

3\. Assign great social importance to

  

Just I copied what I found on the net with the dictionaries. One may invent some verbs, but I am not sure. For celebration or festivity, in general, there is a commonly used word उत्सव derived from the verb :सू \| तु० सेट् प० \| षू प्रेरणे ६. १४४ \|\|

but the verbal forms are not known. सुवति will be normal one, but not used in the sense of celebrate much, as its noun form is used.

  

Open for further opinions from other learned members.
