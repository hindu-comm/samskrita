Thank you for expressing your intention and opinion.Scholastic discussion and opinion is one thing, which needs testimony to say any thing.

  
Free lance discussion need not any such restriction or standard. That is why you could not get any answer from the Sanskrit Teachers  

and got the same answer from me. I feel sympathy right with you....etc etc  
  
**Shreyas replies:**

**Respected Dr Bhat Sir,  
Thank you very much for your scholarly evaluation of languge use. I fully agree with your well considered assertion that the sanctity of Sanskrit as standardized 2000 yrs ago must be maintained. After all the brilliant rishis standardized  
the language with some good foresight, their aim being to preserve the cultural level and spiritual height that was reached at that time. Your advice is well understood that resort to practical words may be resorted to in informal chat but care has to be taken that the deep semantic content is not destroyed**.  
  
I came up with my query only because I am learning spoken Sanskrit and I found difficulty in conveying 'to celebrate'!  
  
On a lighter note, if you permit me, I can say something about your last sentence

"Cheers, Cheers, Cheers." clashing the wine pegs in celebrations, do not have an equivalent expression in Sanskrit. Please invent one".  

In 1971, I had gone to Narobi for a three day official visit. My sponsor, a highly educated Krishna devotee from Gujarat, took me to his house one evening , poured some whisky and said "Let's now keep business aside and do some 'Krishna Krishna'! When I told him I didnt understand, heexplained: Shri Krishna's yadav dynasty perished because of alcohol leading to yaadavaasthali and so whenevr we drink, we must remind ourselves of the poison we are taking. And so the least we cud do is to say"let's do Krishna Krishna' insteas of 'cheers'!  
  
I think he had already innovated a substitute for 'cheers'! And until I started keeping away from alcohol from some ten years ago,Ihadbeen using that 'Krishna Krishna' regularly! Perhaps that has subtly helped me in remaining away from alcohol for the past 10 years or so. I think such innovations should be welcomed! No?  
  
Submitted in all humility and with fondest regards,  
...Shreyas (learner for life).
