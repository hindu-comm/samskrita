Hello,

  

We are Celebrating 15th Year of our Organization in Cary, North Carolina which is a Diwali Celebration and we want to name this Event (One Word possibly or Two). We wantto name in such a way that its a 'Grand Celebration' - Mahotsav was one Word, we were trying to see if we can get some more ideas on Sanskrit/Hindi Words to name this event. Any help is highly appreciated.

  

Thank You,

Runa
