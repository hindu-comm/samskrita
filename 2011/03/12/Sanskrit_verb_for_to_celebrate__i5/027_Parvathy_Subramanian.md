Dear all,  
  
The ready and easily thinkable and approachable meaning of the word ***Celebrate*** in Sanskrit is: according to- <http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utsava&script=&direction=SE&link=y> -soken [sanskrit.de](http://sanskrit.de) dictionary, it is ***UTHSAV.***  
  
Kindly clarify if I am wrong.  
  
Thanks,  
  
With regards,  
Parvathy
