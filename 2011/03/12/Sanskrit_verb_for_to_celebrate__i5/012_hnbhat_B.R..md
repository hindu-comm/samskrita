Thank you for expressing your intention and opinion.

  

Scholastic discussion and opinion is one thing, which needs testimony to say any thing. Free lance discussion need not any such restriction or standard. That is why you could not get any answer from the Sanskrit Teachers and got the same answer from me. I feel sympathy right with you.

  

Instead of reading the already available rich and wide diverse literature and learning to enjoy them. I don't understand the obligation to put new ideas and new cultural contents into the deep rooted usages of the words. If it is for day to day use, well, no restriction of any such scripture is needed, and one can use as one may wish to do. But if ask for sanction, it will only pollute the real usage and at a time it will be forgotten at all. This is my personal opinion.

  

While the regional languages easily adopt the newly borrowed words from any other language, including Sanskrit, which is native, Sanskrit is not so flexible yet. I don't say it is out of usage as any language with a firm structure, can be used as spoken language. And the level of spoken language is also restricted to the utilitarian base of the language one learns and cannot always be regularized with standard language used for literature. For Sanskrit had been standardized 2000 years ago and yet during the period it has been maintained, though minor lapses could be observed here and there.

  

One can learn as many as languages and use all of them without confusing between them and try to understand their literature and cultural contents of the words in their own face value. Thrusting one cultural content of a language into the other, will always result in misrepresenting them.

  

I have seen many speaking Sanskrit as they like without any regard for the conventions of the standard language. It is their choice. If you ask me, I can also adopt the same words borrowed from any other language, instead of distorting their image in another language. Bus, Car, motor-cycle, etc. wedding day celebration etc.

  

In western culture, it is common that they live for some time together after marriage and at any moment they can depart with mutual consent or not. Hence, each year spent together is a matter of fact that gains much importance to celebrate. In India, it is becoming the fashion, imitating the western culture, and hence the marriage day celebration attached. You can sanskritize them without consulting any scholar's opinion about the words to express them. It is your choice.

  

"Cheers, Cheers, Cheers." clashing the wine pegs in celebrations, do not have an equivalent expression in Sanskrit. Please invent one.
