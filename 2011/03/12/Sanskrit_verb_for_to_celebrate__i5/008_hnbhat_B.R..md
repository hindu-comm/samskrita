Thanks for more synonyms which have the translation as celebrate. Most of them are contextual meanings, and outside the context, it is doubtful whether they would convey the same meaning as the cultural content of the verb to celebrate in the classical literature.

  

It is a fact that it is always difficult to transmit the cultural contents of one language through another language with synonymous words. Moreover, there are no synonyms exactly in any language, only with difference ignored, are used in different contexts to convey the similar meaning. How can we expect it to be between the two verbs of two languages to convey the cultural content with the languages of the other language alien to it?

  

It is only the difference that English is day to day language now reflects contemporary cultural content and Sanskrit reflects the cultural content of by gone days and now only the cultural contents remain, with the only those words expressing them.
