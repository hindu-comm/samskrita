An old saying.

कन्या वरयते रूपं  
माता वित्तं पिता श्रुतम् /  
बान्धवा: कुलमिच्छन्ति  
मिष्टान्नमितरॆ जना: //

When choosing a bridegroom,  
different persons have different  
preferences.  
  
Kanyaa varayate rupam- the bride  
decides on the personality or appearance  
(of the groom).  
Mata vittam –the bride’s mother enquires  
about the wealth or earnings of the groom.  
Pita shrutam –the girl’s father decides on  
the basis of the groom’s educational  
qualification.  
Bandhavah kulam –the bride’s relatives enquire  
about the groom’s family.  
Others expect a sumptuous feast.
