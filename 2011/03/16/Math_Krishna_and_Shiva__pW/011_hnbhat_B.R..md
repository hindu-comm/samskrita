Thanks for the efforts.  
  

I had seen this verse tossed in many other forms and without any successful explanation including this one too long ago, but no satisfactory explanation was offered in any. It is not expected too unless the commentator comments them himself.

  

The main purpose of the verse is astronomical calculation and it is served. Further, if it is not commented, as in the case of the most cases of Yamaka, it is hopeless to spend time with groping with it. I remember a verse I had in praise of Shiva:

  

त्वयि सति शिव दातर्यस्मदभ्यर्थिताना-

मितरमनुसरन्तो दर्शयन्तो ऽर्थिमुद्राम्।

चरमचरणपातैर्दुर्ग्रहं दोग्धुकामाः

करभमनुसरामः कामधेनौ स्थितायाम्।।

  

O Shiva, when you are here to bestow on us whatever we desire, we are following other deities stretching hand in begging mood. (This is like)

We desire to milk the camel which is difficult to achieve due to kicking with its hinder legs, while we have within our reach, the Kamadhenu itself (which is capable of bestowing us with whatever we desire.).

  

Just though of yamaka-s and other Citra-kavya-s available in Sanskrit poetical verses, while we are trying to solve this riddle. 15th Sarga of Magha (Shishupalavadha) and Kiratarjuniya, respectively be interpreted, as describing reproaches as well as praises of Krishna and Shiva respectively. There are commentaries available too. If we want to enjoy, that is always available so that we can build up our vocabulary too.

  

Hence I didn't try at all. Hope somebody would come up with proper solution.

  

Wish you all the best of luck.
