"Meaning leading to shiva may be some powerfull Yamak if the Shloka starts with Gopi...."

  

Thank you. This is one clue, but, not sufficient for me to pick up and follow. I hope you, or others, can take this further.

  

To address other questions / points:

1\. Mathematical aspect is well documented and analyzed - my question does not pertain to it.

2\. My first guess was that the first quarter was on Krishna, the second on Shiva, the last 2 being the mathematical stuff. But, it turns out that the first is also mathematical, and the last line has some comprehensible meaning. So, I have to go with the original expectation that all whole verse can be parsed in 3 different ways to resolve into 3 interpretations.

  

"gala + hAlA + rasaM + dhara refers to Shiva, holder of a snake round his neck."

  

Vidya
