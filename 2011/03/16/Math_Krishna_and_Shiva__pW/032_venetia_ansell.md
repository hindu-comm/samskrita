Namaste sarvebhyaH

vilambaH kSamyatAm - I had said that I would post the verse I thought I remembered seeing in which a shloka that gives the value of Pi also reads as a verse in praise of Krishna one way and Rama the other way. I am afraid I have either got two things mixed up or have misplaced the book in question. There is certainly a verse about Krishna and Rama which can be read anuloma and pratiloma but it may not also contain the value of Pi.



At any rate here is what I have found in the book 'Pride of India' produced by Samskrita Bharati (which by the way is full of interesting facts):



gopIbhAgya madhuvrAta shRNgIshodadhisandigha

khalajIvita khAtAva galahAlAharasandhara



the translation given is "Oh (Krishna), the fortune of the gopis, the destroyer of the demon Madhu, protector of cattle, the one who ventured the ocean depths, the destroyer of evil-doers, the one with a plough on his shoulder and the bearer of nectar, may you protect us'



But I find this translation hard to follow - for instance how does 'vrAta' mean 'destroyer' and how does 'khala-jIvita' mean 'the destroyer of worthless men' rather than 'the life-force of worthless men'. I am also not familiar with the word khAtAva - perhaps the pada-ccheda given above is wrong.



Using the katapayaadi sankhya system you get the value of Pi: 3.1415926535897932384626433832792



Apologies is this is a repetition of the earlier discussion. If I am able to find the other palindrome verse I will post it.



ShubharAtriH
