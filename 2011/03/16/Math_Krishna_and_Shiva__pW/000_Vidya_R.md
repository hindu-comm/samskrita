गोपीभाग्यमधुव्रातशृङ्गिशोदधिसन्धिग ।

कलजीवितखाताव गलहालारसंधर ॥

It is said that the above verse has 3 meanings ->

1\. descriptive of Krishna

2\. descriptive of Shiva

3\. a mathematical formula

  

While the mathematical aspect is well explained, the first two are not.
My sister's elderly neighbor is very desirous of knowing 1 and 2. Can somebody offer those 2 interpretations?

  

I found an online, a translation as follows:

"O Lord anointed with the yogurt of the milkmaids' worship (Krishna), O savior of the fallen, O master of Shiva, please protect me."  

  

The verse is quoted in a book on Vedic Mathematics.

  

Thanks in advance, from me, my sister and her elderly neighbor :)
