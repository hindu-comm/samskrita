Does this Tarkasangraha contain Trigonometry? May be.

  

But the work as can be seen from the image, is entitled Tantra-Sangraha, a work on Ganita and not on Tarka.

  

Tarka-sangraha is another work by Annambhatta, a primer to both Indian Nyaya and Vaisheshika system. I was confused to read the title.

  

Anyhow, thank you for the information on Ganita. Lilavati, is the popular one for Ganita.

  

With regards
