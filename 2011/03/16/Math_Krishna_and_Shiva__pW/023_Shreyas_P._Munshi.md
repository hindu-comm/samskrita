standard of proof".  
  

Respected Arvind-ji,  
  
I admire your insistence on maintaining an objective, unbiased , approach before accepting or rejecting anything. First it was on Macaulay. It virtually woke me up! And now on use of the adjective Vedic...  
  
In full support of the paragraph of your mail which I have quoted above, I may mention that some six years ago,a gentleman (in Mumbai) approached the medical association to teach what he called was Vedic Meditation. Many doctors fell for it but on persistent queries by one unassuming doctor, the fellow could not say why it was called Vedic Meditation by him. When the doctiors kept demanding the answer, he blurted out that meditation is an ancient technique and it was easy to attract participants with the adjective...Vedic!  
  
Well in the above case nothing was lost because basically it was just a modified shavaasan yoga technique. It had to do some good! But the point is that it showed that one's offer becomes more acceptable by using the adjective ...Vedic..for better marketing! (I hasten to mention: No aspertions cast on respected Vidya-ji's post. I am only admiring your insistence on the objective approach).  
Submitted...Shreyas
