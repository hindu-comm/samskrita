katapayaadi system is not attributed to Aryabhatta. It is attributed to vararuchi and the earliest reference found is said to be in chandravaakya.  
  
Aryabhatta had a completely different system that is fantastically suited to represent astronomical (literally) numbers. I have blogged about it in <http://vagartham.blogspot.com/2008/09/aryabhattas-numerical-encoding.html>  
  
coming back to the sloka - shiva krishna reference.. i dont know the word-by-word meaning but the word references are enough to suggest praisings to shiva and krishna (gopi, madhu, srngi, galahaala, kalajIvita etc).. Likely the first line is Krishna, second line is Shiva.
