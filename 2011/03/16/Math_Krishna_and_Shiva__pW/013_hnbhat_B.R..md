गोपीभाग्यमधुव्रात- शृङ्गिशोदधिसन्धिग

खलजीवितखाताव गलहालारसंधर\|  
  

Anyhow, here is not much to be achieved by the grammatical analysis as the Translation somehow is imaginary from the obvious words. I could not follow the translation at all.

  

If we take the grammatical analysis for the translation, it would some how applicable for both Shiva and Vishnu too common adjectives for both. But nowhere on the pages I found on the net, this verse has been commented differently in its mathematical value which is the main objective. The remaining can be made out from your imagination.

  

गोप can mean Krishna as the cowherd and also Shiva in his capacity as पशुपति, and his wife can be गोपी = पार्वती, and the rest common for both. भाग्यमेव मधु, तस्य व्रातः = समूहः, तत्सबुद्धौ गोपीभाग्यमधुव्रात - common address in the vocative case ending.

  

शृङिशो दधिसन्धीन् गच्छति इति शृङ्गिशो दधि-सन्धि-ग =

  

Following each cow, one who goes the cowpen or the hut where curd is kept for selling. दधि-सन्धि;

शृङिणि = गिरौ शेते इति शृङ्गिश, vocative of Shiva, who is called गिरिश elsewhere. Now remaining will be उदधि-सन्धिं गच्छति इति उदधिसन्धिग; It may refer somehow, mean his presence at the churning of Milk Ocean. I don't have a clear idea, by splitting this

way. उदकानि धीयन्ते अत्रेति उदधिः, सन्धीयते इति सन्धिः = juncture;

Any suggestion on this point is welcome.

  

खलजीवितखात = खलानां जीवितानि खातानि येन सः, खलजीवितखात;

One who has uprooted the lives of wicked persons;

(khan = to root up (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988));

which can be commonly applicable for both Shiva and Krishna.

  

अव = please protect.



गलहालारसंधर = गले हालारसं धरतीति गलहालारसंधर;

In the first Krishna's case, गले हाला यस्य सः, गलहालः, कालियः, तस्मिन् रसं धरतीति विनोदं करोतीति गलहालारसंधर;

In the case of Shiva, it is he himself, carry the हालाहल venom during the churning of the Milk Ocean, हालाहलरसं धारयतीति It can be also as denoting Shiva as carrying the serpent, which is having हाला venom as suggested by Vidya.

  

This much can be got out of Grammatical Analysis of the structure. But in the third linke, it is found as खल in all the web pages, instead of कल as given by Vidya.

  

There are many discussions about the authenticity of the claim to be Vedic sourced mathematics. I saw in one page, it is ascribed to Atharva-veda parishishta. But no specific bibliographic reference is given. Many believe that it was produced by the Swamyji himself, who had through mathematical knowledge and ascribed its authenticity to Vedic source. According to some, still by the fans of the Swamyji, it is adopted for teaching mathematics in some corners to make it popular. The source of the information could not be verified.

  

Hope this is an attempt of grammatical analysis as proposed. More could be got, by imagining the possible qualifications with the same words and derive them from following the norms of grammar. I have purposefully omitted the reference to the rules concerned in the Ashtadhyayi text. If anybody feel the necessity, I can provide.

  

Sorry for the lengthy message.
