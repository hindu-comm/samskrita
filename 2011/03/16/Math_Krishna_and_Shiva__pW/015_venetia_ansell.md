Ihad seenthis same shlokabut, while it also gave the value of Pi, it was read as a verse in praise of Krishna and then of Rama. If I remember correctly this double reading was achieved by reading the shloka first left to right and then right to left. This anuloma/pratilomatechnique is I believea particular kind of citrakavya.
