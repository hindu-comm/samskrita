Thank you both for providing more information.

  

Here is a link to the criticism of Mahabharata, in general:

by CA Vaidya.

  

Just searching for the popular verse quoted by Anandavardhana, in his poetics masterpiece, as for the modulation of Sringara RASA into KaruNa:

  

अयं स रसनोत्कर्षी पीनस्तनविमर्दनः।

नाभ्यूरुजघनस्पर्शी नीवीविस्रंसनः करः॥

  

as the words of the queens of the king Bhurishravas, taking in their laps the arm cut off him in the battle field. It is simply criticized in the above page, that it is highly improbable that women are allowed to to roam in the battle-field.

  

More would be found on reading Mahabharata or the books on criticism on it.
