Thank you both for your kind efforts in tracing the source so promptly.  
  
But isn't it strange that the young Rishyashringa is astute enough to recognise their voices to be sweet as that of a 'pums-kOkila' but is innocent of the notion of gender.  
  
Is it that he understands gender in other animals, but not in his species..?
