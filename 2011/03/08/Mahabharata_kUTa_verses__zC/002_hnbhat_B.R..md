Here is one popular:

  

अट्टशूलाजनपदाः शिवशूलाश्चतुष्पथाः।

केशशूलाः स्त्रियॊ राजन भविष्यन्ति युगक्षये

The Mahabharata : Book 3: Chapter 186.37

  

I don't think anybody have collected such shloka-s separately. In fact, they are not riddles or समस्या-s in their proper status, but only difficult to grasp their meaning. In the above verse, one cannot understand anything from the above verse without the commentary:

  

अट्टमन्नंशिवो वेदः शूलो विक्रय उच्यते।  
केशो भगः प्रोक्तः' इति कोशः

  

citing the lexicon for the words. All the verses in the Yaksha Prashna, deserve elaborate commentary, without which the idea is not graspable at all. There are many others at random met in Mahabharata text. Only Nilakantha-s commentary was available.
