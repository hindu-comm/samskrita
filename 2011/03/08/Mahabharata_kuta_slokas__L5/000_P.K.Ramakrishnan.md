One such sloka which I have heard is this -

Bhishma when hit by an arrow says -

अर्जुनस्य इमे बाणा:  
नेमे बाणा: शिखण्डिन: /  
छिन्दन्ति मम गात्राणि  
माघमासे गवामिव //

These are arrows of Arjuna  
not of Shikhandi.  
They are piercing my body parts  
just like that of cows in Maagha month.

The last line does not make any sense.  
So it takes some time to understand the meaning.

I am given to understand its meaning thus:  
माघमा सेगवामिव -  
Just like maaghamaa piercing segavaa.

It is a general belief that when a baby crab is born  
it bursts open the mother crab to come out from the  
womb and the mother crab dies.

But both Apte and Moneir Williams give the meaning  
of maaghamma as the mother crab and segava as the  
baby crab.

Learned members of the group may discuss.
