Thanks Anilkumar for the quotation of Grihyasutra, which even simplifies the reading without a "koota" which is no more a "koota" in the light of this quotation. Simply it would mean only a simily:

  

These arrows are of Ajuna which cut through mylimbs like the bodies of cows in the Magha month. These are not from Shikhandin (which never afflict him). He recognize them very easilydifferentiated by their touch.

  

Now it is up to you to accept it a "koota" or not. But I too agree the other reading, makes much sense in the context. He rejoiced the piercing of the arrows of Arjuna, like a mother crab at child birth.

  

Whether this was intended by the poet or not is a different thing, as pointed by Vimalaji. Such verses, may be taken as cases of interpolations during several times, during the transmission of the text too. There is such possibility too along with the alleged scribe Ganapathy became popularly known as such.

  

And it is the freedom of the poets to use Koota shloka-s too.
