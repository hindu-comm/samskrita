Thank you for one more kUTa shloka from Mahabharata.  
  
The MahabharataBook 6Chapter 114  

60kṛntanti mama gātrāṇimāghamāse gavām iva  
  arjunasya ime bāṇā neme bāṇāḥ śikhaṇḍinaḥ

  

Everywhere it is typed like this. I too had been given to understand as you have described. Probably Apte and Monierwilliams are confused.

  

  

Here is some notes on a German Book on Arthashastra of Kautilya:

According to Indian belief, the crabsat birth of cubs.

These split namely her back and come out.

See eg Mbh.III, 268, 9, VI, 119, 66 Nīl.s gloss and PWkarkaṭīa),karkaṭakī2),*kulīrād*, māghamā, segava.The counterpart is the snake.They eat their own young, and they are the egg hatched out.Agnipur.tr MN Dutt (1908), p. 1088th.

  

The translation of Monier Williams and Apte seems to be based on the confusion of the interpretation of Nilakantha by way of quoting lexicon. Also the same idea is repeated again in the previous Parva too:

  

The MahabharataBook 12 Chapter 137  

85गृहस्नेहावबद्धानां नराणाम अल्पमेधसाम

  कुस्त्री खादति मांसानि माघमा सेगवाम इव  

  

gṛhasnehāvabaddhānāṃ narāṇām alpamedhasām  
*kustrī khādati māṃsānimāghamā segavām iva*



The second instance gives the idea clearer I hope. Both "māghamā segava" mean crab, one mother crab and the other young crab. Here too we can interpret like the young crab eating the mother crab,leaving apart the first half, it seems to be quite clear. The same seems to be the idea in the earlier occasion too with which the idea is like the young crabs eat their mother crab which suits in both cases.

  

karkaṭīa),karkaṭakī2),*kulīrād*, māghamā,

  

The first qualifies the second word and the preceding word. as synonyms. The highlighted portion created confusion in translating the words by both the lexicographers. They have taken to mean like the snakes, which eat their own younger ones and accordingly translated these words taking it as the first to meanthe mother curb eating the young crab. This explains the situationThus, they have taken the reverse. अल्पा कर्कटी - कर्कटकी; कुलीरम् अत्तीति कुलीरात्, माघं मिनातीति माघमा; seems to be the derivations possible for these. The other seems to be underivable from etymology unless some commentator offers suitable one to mean the crab.

  

Here is one more example of the same example of taking it as the female one too:Crab, Female (Karkaṭakī)

  
The female crab is a figure of self-destruction. Thus, Draupadī remarks that Jayadratha attempting to kidnap her is digging his own grave like a female crab conceiving for her own destruction (ādāsyase karkaṭakī 'va garbham3.252.9; vide the commentaries quoted on 6.114.60 to the effect that young crabs, being born, eat their way out of their mother's body).  

  

Here the word*karkaṭakī*seems to be taken for female crab. Here too it may mean simply young curb too. But the blogger makes clear our idea of the young one coming out of the womb eating the body of the mother crab. So the point of confusion was the lexicon quoted. If we take three words meaning young crabs, then keeping in the proper way, the*kulIraat*is adjective for the young curb (and not for mother crab as they both seem to have taken) and all the same the explanation fits well. This quotation conforms with the one explained by Ramakrishnan, though in others earlier ones is doubtful, but in its conformity to this.

  

But eating the younger ones, is common feature of the serpents as noted in the first quoted one blog (german). In siddhantakaumudi to we have the expression that the serpents, with the example of the usage of "पुत्त्रादिनी सर्पिणी" which is a counter-example of the वार्तिक "नादिन्याक्रोशे पुत्रस्य" which prohibits the duplication of the consonants in the word putra optionaly when it is followed by word "adin" (one who eats) used inpejorative sense. But if it is meant as a statement of facts, the consonant is duplicated "ttra" as in the present counter example, the female serpent used to eat its own cubs. With this in mind, the quotation of Nilakantha in his commentary, made the words interpreted in the reverse of the intended ones. This seems to be the explanation for the meaning given in both the dictionaries.

  

Tossed for more discussion from the members.
