Dear PaNDitAH

I am a little confused by this verse. Is it just a mistake of the original poet or an incorrect reading (and then re-writing, by someone else subsequently ) ? Also why would poets make the meaning difficult to elicit, in the first place? Is it not better to write something that everyone can easily understand?

I was disturbed with the grammatical status, in spite of my supporting the different interpretations. Now I found the solution in the Geetha Press Edition:
