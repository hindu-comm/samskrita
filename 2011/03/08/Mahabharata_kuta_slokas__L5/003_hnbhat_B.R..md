I was disturbed with the grammatical status, in spite of my supporting the different interpretations. Now I found the solution in the Geetha Press Edition:

  

Reading correctly:

  

माघमां सेगवा इव;

  

for the portion in question. Now it is simplified, with the lexicon quoted:

  

माघमा = कर्कटी, ताम्, mother crab; सेगवाः = शिशवः,

These arrows pierce my body like the young crabs do the mother crab and they are not of Shikhandin, but of Arjuna. The dictionary meaning is also justified and the other reading poses many problems grammatically.

  

Even if we take as माघमा it will be in singular and would not fit with the verb निकृन्तन्ति in the plural. For that some modification is needed माघमाः and it can go well with the verb. Then सेगव stands for the mother crab in the accusative. I am sorry that I could not get the correct reading on the net at that time. With this reading, there is no problem with the words. Now all the words quoted by the commentator also can be taken to denote the female in general. and the other सेगव is in masculin plural. Only for derivations some more attempt may be needed. But the lexicon gives the two as synonyms.

  

With regards
