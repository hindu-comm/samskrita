Dharmaakutam, a sanskrit commentary on Ramayanam is needed. I was able  
to download Balakandam, yuddha kandam, and kishkintha kandam part 1  
from the net. I will be much thankful if anybody having the full set  
or Aranya kandam, sundara kandam and kishkintha kandam in full can  
share them with me. The IIT kanpur site shows all the kandams but they  
have uploaded only the balakandam text in unicode.
