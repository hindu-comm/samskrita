adiyen dasasya vignaapanam.  
At [valmikiramayan.net](http://valmikiramayan.net) we can get the text of Ramayanam. But what adiyen require is a commentary on dharmams emphasized in Ramayanam. adiyen have uploaded the available files at [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) Adiyen want the remaining as detailed in my previous mail. It is a very rare commentary and that i am having were downloaded from IISC site.
