Thanks Aravind for your lengthy but worthy of reading note and I feel content to have spent a little fraction of my time to read a unbiased opinion of the contribution of Max Mullers" alleged bias and agenda of missionary of establishing superiority of the imperialists of the west.

  

I too had the same opinion, and glad to meet a person with similar thinking but coming up with providing more concrete evidence. It is only natural that living side by side two language communities or more can have exchanged their culture and language structures too beside the exchange of words worthy of borrowing. That doesn't prove any evidence of superiority or confer it by itself, unless one intentionally turns the evidence in favor of his argument. Even youngsters are discouraged from reading the translations by western scholars as they are biased!

  

I do refrain from commenting any more lest it would invite undue disputes and arguments in this forum too, which is free from such things so far.

  

Thanking you once again

  

With regards
