Sirs,  
In it is laughable when linguists and Sanskrit pundits talk in support of Aryan invasion theory. First and foremost, linguistics is not exact nor is it deterministic that one can bet their lives on it as conclusive proof. Neither archeology, nor genetics nor historical proof supports AIT. Extolling Max Mueller as a person of high morals is treachery if not anything. In a letter to his wife  

on December 9, 1867 he writes:  
  
**“…I feel convinced, though I shall not live to see it, that this edition of mine and the translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India, and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of their religion, and to show them what that root is, I feel sure, the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years.”**  
  

There are many such recorded facts about him which I don't want to mention for the sake of brevity that points to the facts of his maleficence and his intention of twisting history....it is strange that people sing paeans to him.  
  
And regarding AIT, better leave it to the experts as this is not the fora to discuss veracity of historical facts. I am here to learn from sanskrit masters. I look forward being taught. I am learning a lot in Sanskrit, that said, I don't consider any of linguists or Sanskrit pundits to prove AIT through language, because language is not the tool that can prove historical facts. AIT is dead, please don't churn theories to keep it alive... knowledge without facts is no knowledge...knowledge devoid of reason is no knowledge. Propagating false knowledge is called propaganda.
