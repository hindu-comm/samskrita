Let me add my voice to support you. Max Mueller is a serious Indologist -  
his interest in the language was as a scholar and as an academic - there  
were no political or imperialist motives or agenda. We are lucky that he  
did so much work which he left behind. The Indologists helped generate  
interest in Sanskrit in anyone who wished to study it, both in India and the  
West. The Aryan invasion is thought to have happened at least 3000-4000  
years ago. A lot of races contributed to the present Indian genetic stock.  
Why are we het up about this? Why do we care? The English don't care that  
the French invaded them in 1066 and introduced French words and culture into  
English as well as assimilating into their genetic stock. It don't mean  
that the English were inferior to the French or that this fact is now some  
sort of French imperialism. We should relax - we seem to suffer from some  
sort of inferiority complex and this manifests itself in many ways.

Parvathi Subramanian says:

\< If you read Michel Danino's "The Invasion that never was......" it  
will make us clear that even Greek and Latin have had an influence of  
Sanskrit. Only to cover it up they - Cadwell and Mueller started  
spreading about Aryan Invasion theory and so on.

The glory of Sanskrit is endless. \>

I have a different take on this.

It has been known for about 200 years that Sanskrit, Latin, Greek,  
Slavic and several other languages, all collectively called Indo-  
European languages, have many similarities and cognate words.  
However, no evidence has yet come forth to suggest that one or the  

other among these has any preeminence over others. In fact, these

  
languages, even in their oldest know forms, are about 3,000 years old  
and the similarities referred to above must have existed even among  
those archaic forms of these languages that are now lost forever.  
Evolution of these languages in all their archaic forms must have gone  
on for tens of thousands of years about which today we know nothing.  
I would therefore rest by saying that all these languages are cognate  
and I would refrain from bestowing any superiority to this or that  
language.

Also, I do not feel that Friedrich Max Mueller, if he is the Mueller  

referred to by Parvathy, can be said to have "started spreading about  
Aryan Invasion theory and so on." Here I am not taking any stand on

  
the rival sides of controversial theory of Aryan origins, on which the  
jury is still out. I am only saying that the nuance emerging that Max  
Mueller had an unstated agenda for which he started 'spreading' his  
theory is unfair to Max Mueller.

A substantial body is available, including Max Mueller's own writings  
which witness his oriental scholarship and regard for India's ancient  
knowledge. For example, see this quote from Max Mueller's seven  
lectures in 1842 on 'India: What can it teach us (http://

"If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most  
richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that nature can  

bestow - in some parts a very paradise on earth - I should point to

  
India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most deeply  
pondered on the greatest problems of life and has found solutions of  
some of them which well-deserved the attention even of those who have  

studied Plato and Kant - I should point to India. And if I were to ask

  
myself from what literature we, here in Europe, we, who have been  
nurtured almost exclusively in the thoughts of Greeks and Romans and  
of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is  
most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more  
comprehensive, more universal, in fact, more human, a life not for  

this life only but a transfigured and eternal life - again I should
