Dear all,  
  
I am basically a English Literature student and we have studied how Sanskrit among different other languages have influenced Englsih. The words: father from pitr;  
bother from bratha; widow from vidwa and so on.  
  
If you read Michel Danino's "The Invasion that never was......" it will make us clear that even Greek and Latin have had an influence of Sanskrit. Only to cover it up they - Cadwell and Mueller started spreading about Aryan Invasion theory and so on.  
  
The glory of Sanskrit is endless.  
  
Let us go on in our research.....  
  
With regards,  
Parvathy
