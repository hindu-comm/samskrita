Aravindji,

Thank you for bringing to light some very original texts about Max mueller and MacCaulay which does shed some light on the notion that I was brought up on.

Its great to see such unbiased views being put forth to keep the spirit of this discussion board from which I have learned a lot through the discussions between learned elders and peers.

I think these intellectually challenging and stimulating discusion are probably like the debates mentioned in stories of many Scholars of the past.
