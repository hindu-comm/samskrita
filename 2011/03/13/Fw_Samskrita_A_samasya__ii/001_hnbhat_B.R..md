One more note:

  

प्रतिपर्व is the avyayibhava compound for पर्वणि पर्वणि। Hence the last line could be read as two words, also, transforming the whole compound into an independent sentence, without any change in the meaning from the other reading.

  

Thanks to Ramakrishnan for one more solution for the same. Though the word parvan is a term used for denoting both the दर्श and पूर्ण

etc.the day of the moon's passing the node at its opposition or conjunction (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
the days of the 4 changes of the moon (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
the moment of the sun's entering a new sign (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

  

in describing the moon and the ocean, its highest tide and enjoyable equinoctial point is Full Moon. It is Highest Tide for the ocean and Fullest digital completion on that day. He is described as पीयूषाश्रयणम्, पानपात्रं for the deva-s, who drink nectar digit by digit day by day, on the Amavasya, it is empy and on PurNimA it is full. Or it can be every day increasing in the Shukla Paksha, for both as suugested by Naresh Keerti.
