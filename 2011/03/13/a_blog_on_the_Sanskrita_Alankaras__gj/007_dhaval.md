hello friends,  
Thanks for your suggestions and comments on the site [www.sanskritworld.in](http://www.sanskritworld.in)  
I have now started posting the book Shishupalavadham by Magha in a  
blog format  
it is in unicode.  
let me know if there is any correction.  
If you need to check the alankaras, go to the category alankara in the  
right side panel.  
  
sincerely yours,  
Dhaval
