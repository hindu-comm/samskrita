गयाश्राद्धम्

The importance of Gayashraadham is  
given in Mahabharatha Vanaparva  
Adhyaya 83 Slokas 9, 10.

एष्टव्या बहव: पुत्रा: यद्येकोपि गयां व्रजॆत् //9  
यजेत वाश्वमेधेन नीलं वा वृषमुत्सृजेत् /  
उत्तारयति संतत्या दश पूर्वान् दशावरान् // 10

One should beget many sons, so that  
at least one of them will go to Gaya.  
Or one should conduct ashwamedha  
or release a blue bull. This will emancipate  
ten previous generations and ten future  
generations.

While performing annual sraadham of our  
father or mother, a mock pilgrimage to  
Gaya is done saying GAYA GAYA GAYA  
and going in the north direction.

There is also a practice that after performing  
a shraaddham at Gaya, one need not perform the  
shraaddam every year. Some people dispute  
this.
