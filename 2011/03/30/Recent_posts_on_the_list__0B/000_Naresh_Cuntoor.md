\[Mod. note\]  
  
Recently we have seen a few threads discussing topics which are better discussed in indology-related forums. In spite of that, we have given some leeway - please do not abuse that latitude.  
  
In all these threads, posts quoting Sanskrit sources to make their case are welcome. But let us think twice before getting into political discussions. If you unsure whether a post belongs on the list, then it probably does not.  
  
Thanks for your understanding.  
  
Naresh
