Dear Respected Members,  
  
I would like to write a few points regarding Macaulay's and British  
influence on development of Languages in India.  
  
The complete speech of Macaulay to British Parliament reflects the  
TRUE INTENTIONS of British and Macaulay very clearly.  
  
<http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html>  
  
The take home summary I think is in Macaulay's own words :  
  
1. "I have no knowledge of either Sanscrit or Arabic"  
  
2. "We must at present do our best to form a class who may be  
interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, --a class of  
persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in  
opinions, in morals and in intellect."  
  
I think he has been fairly successful in this, but unfortunately for  
the world today, the science, tastes, opinions, morals and intellect  
present in Sanskrit texts are not as well known as English and will  
take many many years to be fully recognised and appreciated because of  
this discourement of Sanskrit.  
  
Many historical facts in school text books in both East and West even  
today are written and read with reference to what Britishers invented  
not what was decribed in Sanskrit texts long before that, which is  
propogation of falsehood in my opinion.  
  
Namaste  
Chitsukha  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
I would summarise the complete text for persons who do not have time  
to read int  
  
"Minute by the Hon'ble T. B. Macaulay, dated the 2nd February 1835"
