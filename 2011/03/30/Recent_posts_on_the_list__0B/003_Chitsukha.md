The purpose of my posting was to expose intentions of Macaulay to the  
members of the forum who may not be aware of this. I could not find  
another single statement that summarises his intentions in a short  
posting.

You are not required to judge my intentions here.

On the other hand, after READING THE FULL MINUTES in the link, I think  
what he attempts to do to Indian traditions and culture is like what  
Hitler was attempting to do to Jews.

It is objectionable that he does not try to understand the glorious  
sciences already present in Sanskrit (the fact that he does not know  
enough Sanskrit), but is trying to corrupt India with what he believes  
as the "new sciences". I think Mahatma Gandhiji realised this very  
well and tried to undo it.

I do not want to reproduce every section presented in the minutes once  
again here as interested members can go through it themselves. But  
what I understand is Macaulay was trying to discourage (e.g. by  
insufficient funding) the development of Sanskrit and native culture.  
I definitely do not want to credit somebody for attempting to subdue a  
great language and culture. The development of educational  
institutions was a byproduct of his attempts to promote English in  
India. In this process many false material have crept into our  
textbooks and created many misinformed/misguided people. Please read  
Dharampal's "The Beautiful Tree"  
<http://www.gyanpedia.in/Portals/0/Toys%20from%20Trash/Resources/books/beautifultree.pdf>  
to know about education in India before 1840.

I appreciate your knowledge of Macaulay's wherabouts on February 2nd  
1835 and apologise for my mistake in calling it a speech without  
verifying the facts. I just verified that the source of Macaulay's  
words are authentic and are relevant to the context of the topic being  
discussed in the groups postings.

I do not see the connection between what was posted on internet  
earlier and what is being posted here. Macaulay's intentions are  
depicted in his words, actions and results when and where he spoke  
those words are not important.

I believe one uses the same language that one is prepared to recieve.
