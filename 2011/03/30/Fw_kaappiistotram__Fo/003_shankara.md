Vasuvajji,

  

There is a book in Malayalam "Arya Dravida Bhashakalude Paraspara Bandham" written nearly 80 years back by a scholar named LA Ravivarma. It is available at <http://www.archive.org/details/AryaDravidaBhashakaludeParasparaBandham-LARaviVarma>

  

In this book he traces the origin of hundreds of verb roots in Malayalam to Sanskrit dhatus. I am not a scholar. I think scholars will be able to appreciate this book better. It is a pity that this book has not yet been translated in to English or any of the Indian languages.  



regards  
shankara
