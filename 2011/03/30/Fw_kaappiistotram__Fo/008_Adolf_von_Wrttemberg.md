प्रिय Vasuvaj,

There is, indeed, a simple way to type देवनागरी quickly and easily in e-mail clients and MS Word, WordPad and Notepad. With the help and advice of Microsoft India and the helpful South Asian language group at Microsoft Redmond I wrote an IME (Input Method Editor) called SanHin. It is for typing both Sanskrit and Hindi, freely available from me and has full documentation if you need to modify it for any special Vedic marks इत्यादि । My Sanskrit students at Hindu University of America, Orlando, Florida use it. I’ve tested it on the following applications/e-mail clients: g-mail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail, MS Word versions 2003, 2007 and 2010 using Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7. It works with all the Unicode-compliant Sanskrit fonts that we’ve tested (e.g. Sanskrit 2003, Chandas and all the Windows/MS Word Devanagari fonts. Send me your Hotmail address and I shall send you the zipped file. Caveat: g-mail does not allow me to send zipped attachments.

स्वस्ति,

विष्णु शास्त्री

P.S. My private e-mail in Georgia, USA is: [wolf...@bellsouth.net]() and I can both send and receive zipped files from it.



शम् च योश्च ।

(May you have) “Happiness and Welfare”

An ancient Vedic greeting.
