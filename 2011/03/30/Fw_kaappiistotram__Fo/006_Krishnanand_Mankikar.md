Dear Mr. Vasuvaj,



does not look likely in HOTMAIL. However, in gmail it is very easy.



Attached please find a devnagari editor, which is relatively good enough. You have to type and copy paste the text. With a little practice you can type 95% of the letters (I mean some joint letters are not correctly displayed, but are a workaound)



Regards
