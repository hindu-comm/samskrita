Dear Shree Adolf von Wuttemberg;  
  
Although your generous offer of e-mailiing the zipped file for typing Devanagari is made to Shree Vasuvaj, I wonder if I can be greedy enough to request you kindly to e-mail the same to me also. If it is possible and not against the porper protocol of this forum, Please e-mail me the said zipped-file for typing the Devanagari script. Thank you most sincerrely for it. Below is my hotmail e-mail address: --  
  
[raj...@hotmail.com]()  
  
Warm regards,  
  
Dr. A. Iyengar
