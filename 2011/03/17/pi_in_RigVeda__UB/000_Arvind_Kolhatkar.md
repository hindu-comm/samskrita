Dear Group,  
  
At the site <http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Mathematics_of_the_Vedas#cite_note-6>  
the following is mentioned.  
  
“In the Rigveda, a formula to find the area of a circle is mentioned  
showing that the Rishis knew of pi, approximating it to be equal to  
22/7. It was used in the formula for the area of a circle  
  
area of a circle = pi\*(AB/2)^2 where AB is the diameter of a circle.”  
The reference given below is to Rigveda, 1.105.17  
  
In order to verify the actual wording, I went to the website  
<http://www.sanskritweb.net/> and located Mandala 1, Suukta 105, Richa  
17. (I hope this is what 1.105.17 means.)  
The Sanskrit text there, (which unfortunately I could not successfully  
copy/paste as the result comes out as garbage!), did not appear to  
have anything to do with the value of pi or areas or any kind of  
computation. In the same website, I found the following translation  
by Griffith of 1.105.17  
  
“Trta, when buried in the well, calls on the Gods to succour him. That  
call of his Brhaspati heard and released him from distress. Mark this  
my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.”  
  
What am I missing and how do I reach the correct place in Rigveda  
which mentions the value of pi? Can someone guide me?
