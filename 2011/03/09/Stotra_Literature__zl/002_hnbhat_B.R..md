Histoty of Classical Literature by M Krishnamachari has got a section on Stotra Literature, which comprises of the history up to the last millenium 19th century (may not be updated with modern writings of 19th century). The book is available in [archive.org](http://archive.org) and downloadable:

I will get in touch if I know any recent study with specific aspect.

  

Most of the stotra-s popular among the religious men, are ascribed to either popular writers in theology or philosophy or legendary persons in epics. Only few have date of composition and any other details if any in case of certain devotional poems as such. But these devotional poems as such are not received by the religious people, who do not know Sanskrit, and in other small stotra-s out of devotion they are learning listening to the ones like shivatandavastotra as recited by the popular singers. That is the real state of Stotra literature in general, excluding devotional poems composed in devotional fervor by scholars in other fields. One is such Twins of Shataka Surya Shataka and its counter part Candi Shataka. by Mayura and Bana two contemporary poets.

  

Even though many popular stotra-s are ascribed to Sri Sankaracharya, traditionally, their authenticity could not be established to the Sri Shankara, the founder of Advaita Philosophy and only few are somehow accepted as from his pen. All are beautiful poetry by themselves, but seems to be composed by different writers at different times from different parts of India and traditionally ascribed to the Great Teacher Shankara taking advantage of his blanket of Advaita philosophy. This is the general opinion of the recent scholars, though hundreds of works are published in his name in volumes.

  

I will update if I came to know of any recent study of the stotra literature. Right now I don't remember any comprehending the span of two thousand years outside writers on the History of Sanskrit Literature.
