Dear Group,  
  
Sanskrit has a very large body of Stotra literature and many of the  
more well-known stotras have been recited over generations by the  
religious-minded. I would like to know if any modern work exists that  
has studied this body of literature as reflective of the history and  
social conditions of the periods in which the individual stotras came  
to be written.  
  
I would also like to know how old are some of the more popular stotras  
such as RaamarakShaa or Shivamahimna. These two have Budhakaushika  
and PuShpadanta respectively as their composers but are these actual  
identifiable historical persons or are any verifiable facts known  
about them?  
  
Maybe someone among the learned members of this Group already has an  
answer, preferably available online, in which case it will be like  
सुवर्णे सुगन्धः...
