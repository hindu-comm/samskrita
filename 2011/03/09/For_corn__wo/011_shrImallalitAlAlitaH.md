Sanscript is a good tool, but it has two demerits :  

1.  It's online tool 2.  It can not write devanAgarI directly. You have to write in specific
    encoding and then it will convert them to devanAgarI.

Keyboard-layouts suggested by me are free from these defects, at least one developed by me is definitely.  

1.  It's offline tool 2.  It's small 3.  It's easy to install 4.  It can write devanAgarI directly in MS Word, etc.
