What I have said above is further supported by these further  
considerations.  
  
Molsworth's Marathi-English Dictionary, available online at  
<http://dsal.uchicago.edu> explains मका at p.624 as Indian corn, Zea  
Mays. 'Indian' here refers to the American Native Indians. Indian  
corn as a description of maize is current even today.  
  
Secondly, there are hardly any old Indian recipes that are मका-based,  
I would even say none. Even today in Mumbai the main consumption of  
मका is as भुट्टा sold on the streets. Cornflakes as a breakfast food  
is confined to the affluent and the Western-oriented.  
  
Classical literature has hundreds of references to the familiar wheat  
and rice but none for मका. The चमक part of रुद्र contains names of  
several grains, pulses, legumes that were known to Indians from those  
times but मका does not figure there anywhere.
