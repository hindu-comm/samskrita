I do not think that there would be any word for corn (maize) in  
Classical Sanskrit because corn was unknown anywhere in the Old World  
till Europeans came into contact with Amerindians in the late 15th and  
early 16th century. Maize was domesticated by indigenous peoples in  
Mesoamerica in prehistoric times. The Aztecs and Mayans cultivated it  
in numerous varieties throughout central and southern Mexico. For  
more, please see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn> .
