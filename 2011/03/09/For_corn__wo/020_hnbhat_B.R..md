I am using Baraha IME for long.

  

For those who are familiar with English Keyboard, Baraha is a short step than typing Sanskrit using Roman alphabets. For others, the key board set up should be learnt first and then practiced. That make only the difference.

  

All of the softwares use the similar encoding Harvard Kyoto, or similar set for those who are familiar with typing English. Thats why people are looking for a better convention. Anyway for those who can use any type of encoding, but should be familiar with English Key Board first. Otherwise it makes not much difference in my opinion. Only preference makes the difference.
