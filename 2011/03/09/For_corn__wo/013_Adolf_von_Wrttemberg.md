Priya Rahul,

Are you looking specifically for an IME (Input Method Editor)? With the help of Microsoft India and advice from Microsoft Redmond, WA, I wrote an IME about two years ago. I named it SanHin for typing Hindi and Sanskrit on a phonetically-mapped keyboard. It runs on the following operating systems: WinXP, Vista and Win7. You can use it to type देवनागरी directly into your e-mail client (e.g. g-mail, Hotmail, Outlook) and with MS Word 2003, 2007 and 2010. In addition to the Devanaagarii fonts supplied by MS Word, you can use Sanskrit 2003, Chandas and other Unicode-compliant fonts. My Sanskrit students at Hindu University of America use it so it has been ‘field-tested’. I have made the IME and keyboard layout available free of charge to anyone who desires to use it.



The installation is simple: double click the SETUP file, switch to SA (Sanskrit) and begin typing in Devanaagarii.

Caveat: WinXP computers need to have the Asian language support files installed first. They are installed by default in Vista and Win7.



शम् च योश्च ।

(May you have) “Happiness and Welfare”

An ancient Vedic greeting.
