I am no computer expert but I was using ITRANS for quite some time. I  
stopped using it after I saw the following on its official website  
[www.aczoom.com/itrans](http://www.aczoom.com/itrans) :  
  
\<This page is here for historical purposes, this package is no longer  
under active development, nor is there any support available. All  
major operating systems now support Unicode, and have built-in input  
methods to enter Indic script letters, so it should be possible to use  
built-in techniques for Indic script output.>  
  
I have since migrated to Baraha, which I find very easy to use for  
Sanskrit and Marathi. Just open Barahapad and start typing. The  
coding is similar to ITRANS in many respects and where it differs, a  
key is provided in the help menu.  
  
Baraha was initially developed for Kannada but has been extended to  
many other Indian languages.  
  
I downloaded the free version and it has all functionalities. I  
notice that it is not so anymore. The free version has some  
restrictions and you will need the paid version (about $20 I suppose  
or rupee equivalent) to use it with comfort.
