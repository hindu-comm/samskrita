The one by Murthy is the right answer. It is found in Subhashitaratnabhandagara Sangaraha.

  

The adjective pratiparva-rasodaya is applicable to all the three. The first Mahabharata containing sections called Parvan-s filled withl aesthetic beauty (Rasa) and Suger cane with nodes having sweet juice broken easily by the nodes; The Sindhu and Indu are mutually related. Rasa means water also in the first case and in the second nectar. The high tide of the ocean during the Parva-days on Full Moon days and the the moon too full of pleasing nectar like moon-light on the Full Moon Days.

  

रसो गन्धरसे स्वादे चित्तादौ विषरागयोः।

शृङ्गारादौ द्रवे वीर्ये देहधातौ च पारदे॥

  

इति विश्वप्रकाशः।
