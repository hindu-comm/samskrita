Dear Group,  
  
  
Dear Group,  
  
For no particular reason I remembered the following anecdote that I  
was told several years ago and thought that it might interest the  
Group.  
  
Ashwatthama Balacharya Gajendragadkar was the one of the bothers of  
the late Prahladacharya Balacharya Gajendragadkar, ex-Chief Justice of  
India, and descendant of Raghavendracharya Gajendragadkar. The latter  
was known for his scholarship in Vedaanta, VyaakaraNa, Nyaaya,  
MimaMsaa and Alankaara. (Raghavendracaharya was invited by  
Chhatrapati Pratapsinha of Satara, descendant of Shivaji, to come to  
reside at Satara as Raj PaNDita from his family’s normal abode at  
Gajendragad in Karnataka. This happened in the early 19th century and  
hence the name. For more info, please see the site  
[gajendragadkar.info](http://gajendragadkar.info))  
  
AB Gajendragadkar was a Professor of Sanskrit , either in the  
Elphinstone College in Bombay or in the Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, I  
am not sure which. (The edition of Shakuntala, prepared by him was a  
part of my personal library when I lived in India.) He was teaching  
मुद्राराक्षस of विशाखदत्त in the class of BA and concluded a lecture  
at the sentence अहो महान् विज्ञानराशिरुपगतः that occurs in the play.  
He expired the next day and अहो महान् विज्ञानराशिरुपगतः literally  
became his epitaph. This happened in 1947.
