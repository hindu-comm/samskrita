Probably not in all the other editions which do not contain the episode of writing of Mahabharata by Ganesha as scribe in the same chapter. Or wieber might have found a version, in which it is not added with the specification of KUTA-shloka-s, following it and a description of them, by which he ascribed the number to be the original number of shloka-s of Jaya-samhita, a ballad poetry by Vyasa. This may be possible too.

  

Anyhow, our writer, CA Vaidya, has given for you a couple of examples of KUTA-shloka-s from each Parava, (but not necessarily exhaustive) in an appendix to his work as you had been longing for such a collection. I have culled out the appendix and attached here to the message for the benefit of others who can easily view it online or collect it downloading it. It is really interesting book. I had already provided the link in my previous post in reply to your query for it earlier.

  

With regards
