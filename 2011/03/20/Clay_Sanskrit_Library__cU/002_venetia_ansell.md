The Clay Sanskrit Library was an excellent project but it was prematurely stopped, about two or so years ago. I know that they were hoping to launch Indian editions (the books co-produced with the New York Press, while very smart, were expensive at $25 each and didn't use Devanagari but Roman transliteration) but unfortunately were never able to.



It seems to stillbe possible to buy the books that were published though.
