Dear group,  
What is the antiquity of present day Hindu festivals like Holi,Dipavali, Sankranti,Navaratri, Sivaratri etc? It is my impression that there is hardly any reference to any of these festivals in classical sanskrit literature. If my impression is correct it is interesting to find out why there is no reference. Scholars of the group could throw more light.  
Regards  
Murthy
