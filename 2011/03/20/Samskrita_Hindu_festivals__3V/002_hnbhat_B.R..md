Thanks Sunder for the nice explanation summing up the relevance of the Festivals and links in addition to the pages.

  

In short, almost all the festivals are in one or other way, are related with some Puranic episode or historical to put it in another way. It may be a commemoration of a particular event of social importance or religious significance, observed by generations.

  

Coming to that, all of the 15 days of Paksha, called Tithi-s have some relation with some Puranic episode to be observed/celebrated religiously. The occur once in a year and in specific month. Not all of them are observed by all the people other than those seriously religious minded. Some observed by fasting, some by feasting and not in the same way in different regions of India.

  

With regards
