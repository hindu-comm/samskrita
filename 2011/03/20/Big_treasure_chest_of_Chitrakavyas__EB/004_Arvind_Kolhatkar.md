Yamaka, as understood in Marathi poetics, is repetition of the last  
one or more syllables of lines of a stanza. An example is the  
following verse from नलदमयन्ती स्वयंवर of रघुनाथ पण्डित

तया वनी एक तटाग तोये।  
तुडुंबले तामरसानपाये।  
निरन्तरामन्द मरन्द वाहे।  
तपातही यास्तव रिक्त नोहे॥

It was an almost inflexible rule in Marathi poetry, with the earlier  
saint-poets as also with the later paNDita-poets, that there could not  
be a stanza without yamaka. An amusing example that I can cite is,  
with some liberty with good grammar:

बाइ म्या उगवताच रवीला  
दाट घालुनि दधी चरवीला  
त्यामधे घुसळताच रवीला  
सार काढून हरी चरवीला

Even modern poets like Keshavsut and Baalkavi followed this rule in  
their creations. Later, Baa SI Mardhekar, who otherwise flouted most  
other rules of conventional poetry, both as regards form and content,  
was still faithful to the yamaka rule.

In recent days Marathi poetry is generally written in blank verse and  
not in the old meters and the yamaka rule is no more obligatory
