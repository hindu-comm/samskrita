I agree with Sai Susarla. I have rejected some posts that veer too much from the Samskritam-centric focus of the list. I am not going to suggest a blanket ban on AIT-related discussion, but let us keep the list objectives in mind before replying to this discussion. For the moment, I will approve - on a case-by-case basis, some posts that are informative (e.g., mentioning related books).  
  
Further, if you feel strongly that some words like dharma do not have English equivalents, then I invite you to write an article in Samskritam to convince the readers.  
  
I would also like to mention that some regular posters on the list are not moderated. As regular participants in discussions, I trust you to make the call whether a post is keeping within the scope of the list or not.  
  
Thanks for your understanding,  
  
Naresh
