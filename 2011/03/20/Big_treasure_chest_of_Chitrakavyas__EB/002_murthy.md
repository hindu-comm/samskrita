Many thanks for the pdf file containing an overview of Citrakavyas. A very interestingtype is the "caturangturangabandha", where over a 8X4 (half of a chess-board) matrix a sloka is written serially, one syllable in a cell and we can read an equally meaningful sloka as per the movement of chess-knight(horse in Indian chess) covering all the 32 cells.

Mathematically it isvery interesting and was discovered much later by western mathematicians. Prof. Knuth, the wellknown mathematician and computer theorist hasunearthed that the earliest appearance of this is in "haravjaya" circa 9-10 century AD. It appears in Vedanta Desika's Padukasahasra (14th century) too. Prof Knuth has worked out a similar verse in English too except that he uses one word in a cell instead of one syllable. More info could be obtained on web through googling.

Regards

Murthy
