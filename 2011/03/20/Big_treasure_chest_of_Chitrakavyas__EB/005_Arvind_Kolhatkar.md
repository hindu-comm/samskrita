In classical India, poetry and learning, including mastery over  
language and vocabulary, were considered inseparable, as the following  
verses show:

विद्वत्कवयः कवयः केवलकवयस्तु केवलं कपयः।  
कुलजा या सा जाया केवलजाया तु केवलं माया॥

हठादाकृष्टानां कतिपय पदानां रचयिता  
जनः स्पर्धालुश्चेदहह कविना वश्यवचसा।  
भवेदद्य श्वो वा किमिह बहुधा पापिनि कलौ  
घटानां निर्मातुस्त्रिभुवनविधात्राऽपि कलहः॥

The first is clear enough. In the second, please note the word  
वश्यवचस्. I think it was for this reason that even accomplished poets  
like Bharavi and Maagha had to incorporate chapters devoted to  
Chitrakaavya into their work. Even Kaalidasa was tempted, albeit in  
a small way, to display his mastery over language in the 9th sarga of  
RaghuvaMsha. Following MammaTa, this was one way of putting Kavya to  
use in pursuit of Yashas.

The modern view would be that if poetry is subordinated to less  
relevant purposes like display of mastery over language, it is a sure  
sign of decadence.
