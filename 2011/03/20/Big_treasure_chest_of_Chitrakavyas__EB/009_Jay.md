Bhat Mahodat,  
My question came as well responded thread had Yamak in subject line  
which I thought was not the Yamak example, but Chitrakavya..

Kolhatkar Mahoday, would this not fall under प्रास, rather than Yamak?

तया वनी एक तटाग तोये।  
तुडुंबले तामरसानपाये।  
निरन्तरामन्द मरन्द वाहे।  
तपातही यास्तव रिक्त नोहे॥

Dhaval,
