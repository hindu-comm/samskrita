Namaste  
Has anyone read the new introduction to the original Penguin translation of Bhagavad Gita by Juan Mascaro?  
  
I believe that the new intro by Simon Brodbeck is not in the same tone as the original by Mascaro Living in the West as I do, I find Mascaro's intro to be beautiful, insightful, respectful and the values of Sanatana Dharma are understood by the author/translator without in any way claiming any kind of western superiority. Mascaro's translation is also very poetic although perhaps not as true to the text as other translations.  
Would be happy to know what others think.  
Thanks  
Padma
