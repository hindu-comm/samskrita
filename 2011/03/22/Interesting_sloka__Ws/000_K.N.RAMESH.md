===================

वने चरामो वसु चाहरामो नदीस्तरामो न भयं स्मराम: ।  
इतिरयन्तो विपिने किराता मुक्तिं गता रामपदानुषङ्गात् ॥

This verse is said to have been recited by some hunters in a forest. The meaning of the verse is -

-   वने चराम: - We wander in the forest -   वसु चाहराम: - We bring money -   नदीस्तराम: - We cross rivers -   न भयं स्मराम: - We know no fear

We can see that each of the quarters in the original verse contains the word “Rama”. It is said that the hunters attained liberation even as they unknowingly uttered the name ‘Rama’ four times. I mentioned this merely to highlight the potency of chanting the divine names. Therefore, we must follow the footsteps of our ancestors and attain divine grace.
