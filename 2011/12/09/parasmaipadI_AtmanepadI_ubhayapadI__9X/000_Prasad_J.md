Dear Members,

  

Ubhayapadī dhātu takes parasmaipada when the result of action goes to other person and takes ātmanepada when the result of action goes to the doer. But if a dhātu is Parasmaipadī then, can the result of action never come to the doer? And vice versa for Ātmanepadī dhātu.



Thank you.



Regards,  
Prasad.
