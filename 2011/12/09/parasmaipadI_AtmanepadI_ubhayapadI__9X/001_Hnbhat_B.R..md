परस्मैपद and आत्मनेपद are two technical terms in the Sanskrit Grammar, to denote the two classes of suffixes and hence they do not have any literal meaning as such than denoting the specific group of suffixes for conjugation of verbs in two different ways.

  

It is dependent on the roots themselves which should take आत्मनेपद or परस्मैपद suffixes besides those listed and explained under the respective topics in सिद्धान्तकौमुदी. One of the conditions is that the स्वरितेत् and ञित् धातु-s take आत्मनेपद suffixes when they denote the action goes to the doer and otherwise परस्मैपद suffixes. This is not applicable any verb unless specifically prescribed in the next 5 सूत्र-s following this one*स्वरितञितः*कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले १।३।७२॥ and optional provisions also. Not for any other verbs as you like it. Only these are called as उभयपदी verbs which is not technical in any sense, other than these take both the suffixes listed in the two groups.
