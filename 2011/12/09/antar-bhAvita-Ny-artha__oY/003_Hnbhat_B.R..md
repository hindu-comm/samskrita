Both are OK. There is no contradiction. Only you have understand the Sutra-s fully and not half way. The first avoids the compound formation अम् with any other words than with which it is prescribed. The earlier is the exception to उपपदसमास and restricts the compound formation to the specific prescribed compound with the उपपद relying which the अम् suffix is prescribed where अम् is an अव्यय which excludes कुम्भं करोति कुम्भकारः where अम् is not an अव्यय.

  

This is exceptional कर्मधारयः "परमश्चासौ कृत्वा च" or परमं कृत्वा.

If any found other than these, could be there. Otherwise not.
