There is no such list, but only context decides such meaning, if such meaning is needed for the context.

This is the reason given by SK as explained further.

Because parama and uttama are not indeclinables, the क्त्वा does not take the substitution ल्यप्।

You are ignoring the explanation given by SK which is correct and explains the counter example. Here is the commentary on the relevant portion of काशिका -

  
अनञिति नायं प्रसज्येपरतिषेधः,किं तर्हि?पर्युदासः--नञोऽन्यदनञ्()। तत्र नञिवयुक्तन्यायेन (व्या।प।६५) नञो यदन्यन्नञ्सदृशमव्ययं तदनञिति परिगृह्रते।तेन कारणेन नञव्ययमनव्ययञ्च परमशब्दादिकमुभयमप्येतदनञ्?न भवति, न तत्राव्ययेन नञा सादृश्यमस्ति। अत्यन्ताभेदादनव्ययत्वाच्च यथाक्रमम्()।तस्माद्?यथा अकृत्वा,अहत्वेत्येतत्?प्रत्युदाहरणमुपपन्नरूपम्(), एवं परमकृत्वा, उत्तमकृत्वेयपि।

  

Because अनञ् means anything other than नञ् equal to it, being अव्यय, the terms means the compound formed with अव्यय-s other than नञ् and the सूत्र makes the substitution restricted to the compounds with अव्यय-s only other than नञ् with the suffix क्त्वा.
