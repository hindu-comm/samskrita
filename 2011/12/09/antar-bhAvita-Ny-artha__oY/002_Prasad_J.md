Thank you very much Bhatji for answering again to my question.  
  
Your answer for antar-bhāvita-ṇy-artha was excellent.  
  
About your answer to second question, I have a further question. SK 783 (A 2.2.20) says, amaivāvyayena: a upapada can only be compounded with an avyaya-kṛdanta if the avyaya-kṛdanta ends in am.  
  
So is there any other sūtra clarifies the contradiction between SK 3332 and SK 783? Or are these ex. parama-kṛtvā and uttama-kṛtvā just an irregularity? Do we also have more examples of upapada compounding with ktvā?  
  
  
Thank you.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad.
