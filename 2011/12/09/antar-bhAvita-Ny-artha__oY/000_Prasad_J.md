Dear Members,

I am studying Siddhānta Kaumudī translated by Śrīśa Candra Vasu and also using Gaṇakāṣṭādhyāyī software. While doing that, I get lot of questions. Many of those I ask to one of my friends but when he is also not able to answer then I am posting here for all the respected Pandits.



1. SK 2750: Even though ‘upa + ram’ is akarmaka dhātu, because it has antar-bhāvita-ṇy-artha, it becomes sakarmaka. Same thing happens with SK 3005 for ‘yudh’ dhātu. Is it that all the akarmaka dhātus have antar-bhāvita-ṇy-artha or only limited dhātus? Is there any such list of dhātus which have antar-bhūta ṇy-artha?



2. SK 3332 OR Aṣṭādhyāyī 7.1.37 Kāśikā: Sūtra says ‘samāse ’nañ-pūrve ktvo lyap’. Commenting on that Kāśikā gives an argument, ’why the term anañ-pūrve is mentioned?’ And gives the answer akṛtvā, ahṛtvā, parama-kṛtvā and uttama-kṛtvā. I could understand about akṛtvā and ahṛtvā, but how to understand about parama-kṛtvā and uttama-kṛtvā? SK gives the reason that this is because of paryudāsāśravaṇāt. And further explains that because of mentioning anañ, any avyaya can be compounded. Are parama and uttama indeclinables? My understanding was, ktvā is compounded only with nañ and not with any other pūrva-pada. Does it can be compounded with other pūrva-padas also?

  

Thank you.  

  
Regards,  
Prasad.
