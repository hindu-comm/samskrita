Congratulations for very nice work.

It is necessary to document the rhythm of all vRttas.

Usually when I read a shloka in a work, it is sung internally in my mind with the rhythm which i have heard. And when I face a chhandas whose rhythm is unknown to me, it becomes difficult to memorize and it is as good as prose...

  

So now i know the rhythm for these 31 vRttas.

If more are added by anybody, it would certainly help..
