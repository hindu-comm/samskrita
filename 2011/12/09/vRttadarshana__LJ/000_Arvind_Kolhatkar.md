Dear Members,

A 15 minute video made by me to illustrate audio recitations of  
several Sanskrit Vrittas has been uploaded to youtube at  
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNnUhll0zzA>. The examples are drawn  
from well-known Sanskrit works.

It is a home production from my sitting room and suffers from a  
comparative lack of technical sophistication

Suggestions for improvement and change are welcome.
