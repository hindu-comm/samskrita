According to Monier Williamscarpata means a thin biscuit of flour and panjarikaa means a cage.



Therefore the meaning of carpatapanjarika has to be inferred as a fragile cage or human body of temporary life as against the everlasting soul which escapes and finds another body.



All the verses refer to the not so lasting nature of the human body as against the ever lasting soul.



I shall quote a few examples.



yaavat pavano nivasati dehe

kusalam taavat pricchati gehe /

gatavati vaayau dehaapaaye

bhaaryaa bhibhyati tasmin kaaye //



dinayaainyau saayam praatah

sisiravasanthau punaraayaatah /

kaalo gachati gacchatyaayuh

tadapi na munchatyaasaavaayuh //
