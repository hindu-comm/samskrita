Double checked. This is the seventh verse in the second act (2.7, and not 3.7 as Arvind Ji mentioned) of Uttararaamacaritam of Bhavabhuuti. It occurs in the conversation between Vaasanti and Aatreyii, when Aatreyii tells Vaasantii that Raama is performing the Ashvamedha. To which Vaasantii asks who is the Sahadharmacaari.nii in the Ashvamedha. Aatreyii tells her that a statue of Siitaa is put up as the wife. Then Vaasantii utters the verse

  
  
वज्रादपि कठोराणि मृदूनि कुसुमादपि  

लोकोत्तराणां चेतांसि को हि विज्ञातुमर्हसि  
  
The relation with Angada and Hanuman is in Ramcharitmanas, where a loose Prakrit poetic translation of the above verse is found in Uttarakanda 7.19 (ga). When Angada departs from Ayodhya and Hanumaan comes back, Kaakabhu.su.n.di tells Garu.da  
  
कुलिसहु चाहि कठोर अति कोमल कुसुमहु चाहि  
चित्त खगेस राम कर समुझि परै कहु काहि  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
