Thank you Dear all...  
Thanks for the references.  
I also would like to ask the members, in what context the sloka

\> वज्रादपि कठोराणि मृदूनि कुसुमादपि  
\> लोकोत्तराणां चेतांसि को हि विज्ञातुमर्हसि

Sri Nityanand Misra gives a glimpse. I would like to have more  
elaboration on this. Does the verse talk about Rama? Rama's  
characters? or somebody else? Please also give gramatical  
interpretation.

With regards,  
Radhakrishnan.
