Namaste,



 This verse appears in Valmiki Ramayana Balakanda itself:





Quote-  
"Note:

The famous shloka that vAlmIki utters when he witnesses the killing of the krauncha bird by the hunter:

mA niShAda pratiShThA.n tvamagamaH shAshvatI.n samAH \|  
yatkrauJNchamithunAdekamavadhIH kAmamohitam.h \|\|  
(bAlakANDa 2.14)

O Hunter! Since you killed one of the pair of Krauncha birds in love, you shall never attain fame!

Since this verse was born of VAlmIki's grief (shoka), it was called "shloka","shokArtasya pravR^itto me shloko bhavatu nAnyathA".

End Quote
