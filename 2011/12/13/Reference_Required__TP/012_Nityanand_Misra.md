Please find attached the commentary of वीरराघव on the verse. He explains it as अर्थान्तरन्यास figure of speech or "antithesis". As per his explanation, the intent of Bhavabhuti is thus - the gentleness of Rama's heart is natural since Sita is free from blame. The cruelty is in forming a statue of Sita, which could not be caused by the gentleness of heart. Hence "को हि विज्ञातुमर्ति".
