"maa nishhaada pratiSThaamtva \| magamaH shaashvatiiH samaaH \|  
yat krau\~Ncha mithunaat eka \| mavadhiiH kaama mohitam \|\| 1-2-15

15. ama= oh, ill-fate one; niSaada= oh, hunter; tvam= you; yat= by which reason; krau\~Ncha+ mithunaat = of krouncha, couple; ekam= one; kaama+mohitam= in lustful, indulged in; avadhiiH= killed; \[tat= by that reason\]; shaashvatiiH= ever lasting; samaaH= ages to come; pratiSThaam+tu= reputation, but; maa+gamaH= don't, get.

"Oh! Ill-fated Hunter, by which reason you have killed one male bird of the couple, when it is in its lustful passion, thereby you will get an ever-lasting reputation for ages to come..." \[1-2-15\]

Comment: This is a celebrated stanza of Sanskrit literature, and controversial too, in deciphering its meaning. The separation of compound tvamagama = tu, ama, gamaH. We are told that this is the first verse of human origin with metrical rules and grammar. Earlier to this, only Vedic stanzas were available with their complicated compositional rules. This is the verse where this epic, Ramayana is said to have triggered off. The above given meaning is just a dictionary meaning. This verse has many comports of which a few are given hereunder:

1\] This verse is taken as ma�gal�cara�a to Ramayana, for any epic has to have ma�gala �d�ni ma�gala madhy�ni ma�gala ant�ni \[A good pious beginning, pious middle and pious ending.\] Thus this verse has the letter maa at its start and maa is lak�m� v�caka in Sanskrit. It is �di var�a� The first letter - loka m�t� m� ram� ma�gala devat� thus amara kosha says for Goddess Lakshmi.

m�= Goddess Lakshmi; ni��da= Oh! Vishnu \[ for Goddess Lakshmi resides in the heart of Vishnu - ni�ad�ti asmin iti ni��da \]; yat = by which act; krounca midhun�t = the couple of demons, namely Ravana and Mandodari; k�ma mohitam= that impassioned one and stole Seetha; ekam= that one, Ravana; avadh�= you killed; by that act of yours �a�vat�sam�= everlasting for ages; prati���m= divine sanctity; tvam agama= you, get.

"Goddess Lakshmi's abode... Oh! Vishnu, by which act of your killing one male demon named Ravana, who in his passionabducted Seetha, and thus you eradicated the vice from the earth, for that you get an everlasting divine sanctity, as Rama, for ages to come."

2\] There is another declination attributing this to Ravana. Ravana is the one who tortures others for his benefit. itaraam saadayati piiDayati iti niSaada - thus: Oh! Ravana; krounch+ midhunaat= from the couple of Rama and Seetha, who are flying from forest to forest like nest-less birds; ekam= one is, Seetha is; avadhii =as good as killing \[her with your torture of abducting; pratiSTaam= your glory in Lanka, at its zenith, as per the kindness of Brahma; ma+agama= never get, hereafter. But this declination is not held right, for it is like a curse, shaapa, and no epic shall start with a bad omen.

3\] Next, this verse is said from the perspective of Rama alone. Sage Narada gave the details of the legend to Sage Valmiki and Brahma orders that the legend of Rama is to be recorded. But Ramayana is full of pathos, karuNa - shoka rasa prathaana. If it is to be penned the writer too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks Rama, say Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like kiraataarjuniiya etc., and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted immediately and Vishnu's test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Rama gets a curse in this verse - maa nishaada.

nishaada= oh tribal: to Valmiki / Vishnu to mythology; for your killing one bird of the couple, to the misery of the female one; shaashvatii = as long as you live on this earth; samaaH+pratiSTaam= togetherness, with your wife; ma+agama= do not get.

Oh! Rama, as long as you are on earth, you do not get the love of being together with your wife... for you have to live with your wife departed \[to Lanka,\] come again and departed \[to forests.\]

But this is differed statement, since Vishnu do not require any personal testing of the capabilities of the writer of Ramayana. Brahma will look after such literary things.

4\] The generally accepted meaning of this verse is this. Any epic's gist is to be said at the start or, at its commencement --- k�vya artha s�canam kascin �dy�m eva nir�pyate --- Thus the above verse included the meaning of whole of the epic, Ramayana.

i\] maa+niSaada= Goddess Lakshmi and Vishnu's marriage in their incarnations as Rama and Setha - depicts -- Bala Kanda.

ii\] pratiSTaam+tvam+agama= renown, you get - by following your father's orders you have repaired to forests, without any political upheaval, thus get an everlasting renown as an obliging son --- depicts-- Ayodhya Kanda.

iii\] shashavatii+ samaa= by dwelling in forest and eradicating demons and helping the saints and sages thus, you achieve an everlasting praise - depicts - Aranaya Kanda.

iv\] krounchayoH= from the atrocious couple; -- krunca gati kau�ily� alp� bh�vayo� ; the atrocious Vali, and Tara couple; ekam+kaama+mohitam = one, passion filled, i.e., Vali, avadhii= you killed Vali - depicts - Kishkindha Kanda.

v\] krouncha +mithunaat= from the couple of lovely passionate birds - here Rama and Seetha; niSaada he Ravana, kaama mohitam lustfully, ekam one \[i.e., Seetha\]; avadhii = almost killed, i.e., her residing in Lanka is as good as death; this depicts - Sundara Kanda.

vi\] krouincha+mithunaat = from the atrocious, couple - Ravana and Mandodari; ekam avadhii one - Ravana, is killed - depicts - Yuddha Kanda.

vii\] kaama+mohitam= by desire, fascinated \[ kama also means a longing, desire, let alone lusting\]; Seetha is fascinated by her desire to see sage's wives in uttara Ramayana and thus she is left in hermitage by Lakshmana. Hence vii canto uttara Ramayana is also suggested. "
