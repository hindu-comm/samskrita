वज्रादपि कठोराणि मृदूनि कुसुमादपि।लोकोत्तराणां चेतांसि को हि  
विज्ञातुमर्हति॥ ३.७

is verse 3.7 in उत्तररामचरित.

This brings me to another query. The verse  
मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समा:।यत्क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकमवधीः  
काममोहितम्॥ ३.५

appears in उत्तररामचरित at 3.5. In popular imagination, it is  
supposed to have flashed into the mind of वाल्मीकि, because of which  
he got the epithet of आद्यकवि. I would like to know whether it occurs  
anywhere else previous to भवभूति and he has borrowed it or whether it  
is composed by भवभूति himself.
