Dear Shri Radha Krishnan, Namaskar.  
The shlok quoted is from Uttararamcharitam of Bhawabhooti,2 nd chapter  
15th Shloka.  
I am unable to type Devanagari version. Otherwise I would have given  
it. Another source is the Subhashit Ratna Bhandagaram of Narayana Ram  
Acharya, page 45, Shlok No 4.  
Hope this serves your purpose.  
Ram Ram.  
Narendra Sakhalkar
