Hi,

  

You could go to<http://groups.google.com/group/samskrita>and search for your posts. :-)

  

You had sent this thread<http://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/browse_thread/thread/70c3e4f200854506/>which has the second circular attached to it.

  

Later Eddie Hadley had sent a link to the third circular, which is still available online at<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/wsc315.pdf>

  

I have also attached it to this email.

  

Regards,

Shreevtsa
