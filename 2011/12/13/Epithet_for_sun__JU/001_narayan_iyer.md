Madam,

  

According to vedas, krishna yajurveda, taittiriya shaka, taittiriya Aranyakam (1.13.61-63), aditi gave birth to eight sons - mitra, varuNa, DhAtha, Aryama, amSa, Bhagha, indra and vivasvAn). She left the eighth son vivasvAn as the lord of the Bhulokah, to lord over the things on the earth, which havecertainty of death (unlike the Deva lokah where living things are immortal), hence sun is called 'mArthAnda'. Sun is appropriating the life span of the living entities while rising and setting, and taittiriya Aranyakam (1.14.64 to 67) request the sun not to appropriate the life span of the living beings, prematurely. As sun is the lord of mrtyu jeevis, he is called "mArthAnda".

  

Regards,

  

narayan
