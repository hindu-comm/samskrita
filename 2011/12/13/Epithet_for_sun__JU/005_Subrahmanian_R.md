This brings to my mind a doubt on the spelling of the word.



Generally North Indians spell it as मार्तण्ड whereas South Indians invariably spell it as मार्ताण्ड. Laghu siddhanta kaumudi gives the former spelling.Apte lists it as मार्तण्ड but also mentions the alternative form मार्ताण्ड. Why is this \[Regional\] difference?
