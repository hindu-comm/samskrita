Scholars like Bhanuji Dikshita, approved both the usages मार्तण्ड and मार्ताण्ड on the authority of lexicons and Grammar. Though the form मार्तण्ड is approved by virtue of the वार्तिक prescribing पररूप in selected words, including them शकन्ध्वादि group, there is nothing to establish that मार्ताण्ड is wrong than the वार्तिक used to justify the usage of मार्तण्ड. Here is the extract from Puranic Encyclopedia justifying the name:

  

  

2\) The name mārtaṇḍa. As Aditi was pregnant, Candra went to the hermitage asking for alms. Due to her diffi­ culties of pregna ncy Aditi was not in a position  to  rise up inst a ntly and greet the
visitor.  Candra thought that it was due  to disrespect. So  he 
cursed  her.  Let  the child in your womb die." At this Aditi
became misera­ble. Kāśyapa saw her crying incessantly and  asked 
for the  ca u se.  Aditi  told  him  all  th a t had 
happened. Kāśyapablessed her and said that the infant would  not die. Thus  the child which was lying dead in the womb came to 
life again . As the  aṇḍa' (egg-embryo)  of Vivasvān went mṛta
(died) by the curse of Candra,  he came  to  be called 
mārtaṇḍa(he who has  aṇḍawhich has become  mṛta). When the child  was  born  he  was given the name Vivasvān.

  

The source of the information is not given. But Vacaspatya quotes a line from Markandeya Purana and this gives a different story than given in PuraNic Encyclopeadia:

  

Surya was himself born in Aditi once again after some time, pleased by her penance as her son. She chose the boon that she will get him as her son to destroy the enemies of Deva-s and conceived himself. When Kasyapa her husband saw her performing hard penance कृच्छ्रचान्द्रायण etc. she asked her why do you kill the embryo? She got angry and said I am not killing him, but enabling him to become the destroyer of demons by performing these Vrata-s and immediately delivered the son. Then a अशरीरिणी वाक् said :

  

Since you have alleged the अण्ड as मारित, by अदिति, your son will be hence called मार्तण्ड.

  

मारितं च यतः प्रोक्तमेतदण्डं त्वयादितिम्।

तस्मान्मुने सुतः सोऽयं मार्तण्डाख्यो भविष्यति॥

The Chapter in Markandeya Purana is called as सूर्यमाहात्म्यः मार्तण्डोत्पत्ति.
