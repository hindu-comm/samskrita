I was not able to access mail for few days and could not read this message earlier.

  

Literally from the etymology of the word, mRtaH aNDo yasya sa mRtaNDaH, tasya apatyam mArtanDaH, which has been illustrated among shakandhu group, for assimilation with the next vowel: a+a = a. mRta+aNDa - mRtaNDa. which makes the word grammatically correct as mArtaNDa and not as mArtANDa which is considerred as a grammatical aberration.

  

As don't know the reason or any legend to support this meaning etymological derivation gives : one who is born to mRtaNDa, with impotent aNDa or dead egg. (or tesicles).

  

Will try when I can access my resources of information.
