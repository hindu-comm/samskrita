The Mantrahs quoted by Sri Narayan Iyer is chanted as "ARUNA PRASNA" , usually chanted during Magha Masa as Surya Namaskara Mantrahs also. Before starting Mantra 1.13.61, if there are any Ladies carrying, they will be sent out or the mantras are chanted in low tone. The Vidhi says"apakramata garbhiNyah" and after chanting mantra No 63, "Yatha sthanam garbhiNyah". It is learnt that when Martanda is propitiated, it may be dangerous for "garbhiNyah" leading to bleeding or some dangers and hence the above vidhi.

The learned scholars may pour some more light on effect of these 3 mantrahs.
