The above are Vedic references as attested by Vedic Concordance of Bloomfield and recorded by other lexicons cited by Bhanuji Dikshit in support of long "a" reading मार्ताण्ड. It is not north and south difference, but difference between Vedic and Classical usage. Probably मार्तण्ड was later formulation influenced by Prakrit and justified by the Varttika later though Panini missed them.
