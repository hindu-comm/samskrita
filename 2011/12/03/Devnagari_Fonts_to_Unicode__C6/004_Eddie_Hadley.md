Anunad,



 “ Write an OpenOffice macro to convert the above legacy font into Unicode Devanagari”



That is the problem – so many legacy fonts, so little time, and let’s not forget those with legacy Romanised offerings.



Yes, I have written one or two of these conversion routines (in C# .NET), already.

But the likes of someone like myself to whom the reading of Devanagari is a one finger, one character at a time exercise, they is a real need to fully convert all the scripts from the original .pdf’s. Once I have all that it in .rtf or .htm, or even plain Unicode text, I’m on my way.



The answer (for me) would appear to be to splash out a little money on Adobe.



This is what excites me about the Adobe offering – despite the .doc in its name, it can not only give me my .rtf format, but would appear to ”Make scanned text editable with optical character recognition”. And I have a few of those .pdf’s as well . . .



Copying and pasting out of .pdf’s appears to be done with extended ASCII and not with Unicode. That’s what puts the p in the portable, no doubt.

But one size does not fit all - which makes for an interesting challenge . . .
