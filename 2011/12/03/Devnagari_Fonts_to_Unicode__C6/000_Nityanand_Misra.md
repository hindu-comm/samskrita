Changing the subject, as this is a separate topic from the original thread.  
  
Thanks Eddie Mahodaya and Shankara Ji for the links. I did not try the converter, because the fonts I have (APS-DV-Stardust and APS-DV-Tulsi) are not listed as options in the dropdown.  
  
Meanwhile I came across a very useful piece of software - DangiSoft Prakhar Devnagari Font Parivartak - it has the options of many more fonts (250+ fonts are supported), it supports copy and paste and also preserves formatting - one can also copy paste from Excel. An introduction to the software (in Hindi) is under [here](http://www.hindimedia.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5321&Itemid=139)  
  
A trial version with limits is available from [here](http://www.4shared.com/file/95041835/4e581a8/DangiSoft_Prakhar_Devanagari_Font_Parivartak.html). The full version costs only Rs 1500 (\< USD 30) which is value for money for the features and the wide range of fonts supported.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
