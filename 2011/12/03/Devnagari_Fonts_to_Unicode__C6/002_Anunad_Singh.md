To convert pdf files containing legacy Devanagari fonts to DOC files in Unicode Devanagari, I follow the following process-  
  
1) Use PDF Nitro (free trial version) to convert PDF into DOC file .
In this process, all the format of the PDF file is maintained.  
  
2) Write an OpenOffice macro to convert the above legacy font into Unicode Devanagari.  
  
3) Open the above doc file in OpenOffice and use the macro which gives me Unicoded Devanagari DOC file.  
  
( By selecting only the legacy font, I avoid converting text written in English or other languages . Only the Devanagari content is converted.)
