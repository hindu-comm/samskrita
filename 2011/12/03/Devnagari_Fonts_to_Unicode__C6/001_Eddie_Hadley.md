Nityanand,



For serious work in extracting and converting the contents of a .pdf
format file into other common editable formats, it seems best to avoid working with material containing proprietary fonts, and also to go to straight to the factory for the all the best tools - *Adobe*.





At £15.37, *Adobe ExportPDF* is obtainable from <https://www.acrobat.com/exportpdf/en/convert-pdf-to-word.html>.



That’s good value in any currency. And that price includes support from Adobe themselves.



I’ve not actually tried it myself, but I have a great many .pdf’s that I would very much like have in the .rtf form.



Open Office already does .rtf \<==> HTML for me.
