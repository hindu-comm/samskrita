Vidya,



 I must put my professional systems analyst/programmer hat on here.



I confess to not knowing my *de Bruijn sequence* any more than I know my anuvṛtti sequence in Pāṇini's grammar, but . . .



Binary, yes.

Table, yes.

Truth table, no way!



It is a list.

A list of three alternate ways of expressing the numerals 0 through 7, along side a list of seven words:

Decimal, binary, and with somewhat customised symbols where u is substituted for the binary 0 and a hyphen(minus?) for the binary 1.



Guru’s may customise as freely as they want, when enlightening their faithful, not so when enlightening the unruly masses at large.

(Just a thought – is there such a being as a lady guru or lady Brahman?)



An injustice is being done to the IT community, Alan Turing will be turning over in his grave! However, this being a human language forum not a mathematical one, seekers of the truth about truth tables, can vivecana logical tables for themselves by means of some impartial Googling.
