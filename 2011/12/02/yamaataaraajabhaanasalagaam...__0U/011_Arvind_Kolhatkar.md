Dear Group,  
The following is what I know about यमाताराजभानसलगम्.  
The earliest mention of the 8 अक्षरगणs appears to be in पिङ्गलs  
छन्दःशास्त्र, where he describes them in the following सूत्रs:  
धी श्री स्त्री म्॥१॥वरा सा य् ॥२॥का गुहा र्॥३॥वसुधा स्॥४॥सा ते क्व त्॥  
५॥कदा स ज्॥६॥किं वद भ्न हस न् ॥८॥  
Later writers on Prosody picked up on this and the following verse  
appearing in वृत्तरत्नाकर by केदारभट्ट show how the neatness of this  
arrangement and the easiness with which it could define a वार्णिक  
वृत्त led to its almost universal acceptance, including their order.  
म्यरस्तजभ्नगैर्लान्तैरेभिर्दशभिरक्षरैः।समस्तं वाङ्मयं व्याप्तं  
त्रैलोक्यमिव विष्णुना॥  
(The same verse appears in छन्दोमञ्जरी of गङ्गादास, another well-  
respected authority, though, whether its original author is केदारभट्ट  
or गङ्गादास is not clear to me.)  
हलायुध too gives the credit to the creation of the concept of अक्षरगणs  
to पिङ्गल in the following verse:  
मयरसतजभनलगसंमितं भ्रमति वाङ्मयं जगति यस्य।स जयति पिङ्गलनागः  
शिवप्रसादाद्विशुद्धमतिः॥  
यमाताराजभानसलगम् is a mnemonic created to remember in one line the 8  
अक्षरगणs and also their structure of arrangement of लगक्रम. Who  
created it and when is not known, though C.P. Brown attributes it to  
पाणिनि, without citing any authority. (p.28 of 'Sanskrit Prosody  
Explained' by C.P.Brown).  
Several other mnemonics exist, including the following given by  
C.P.Brown, which he, in turn, got from another unnamed German scholar:  
मायावी यतात्मा रावण: सहसा तन्त्राणि जजाप भावय न(इ?)ति  
I had learned the following two Marathi mnemonics as a student in  
school:  
य यमाचा न नमन त ताराप र राधिका।म मानावा स समरा ज जनास भ भास्कर॥  
आदिमध्यावसानी ये यरता लघु अक्षर।भजसा तेवि गुरु ये मन सर्व गुरूलघू॥  
(The first is clear enough. The second one says: य, र, त have लघु at  
the beginning, middle and end respectively ( the others being गुरु);  
भ, ज, स have गुरु at the beginning, middle and end respectively ( the  
others being लघु); म. न are respectively all गुरु and लघु. I am sure  
other languages have similar mnemonics in them.  
Dr Madhav Trimbak Patwardhan, in his book छन्दोरचना published in 1937,  
mentions all this, but his book does not define and identify hundreds  
of meters noted by him in the classical way, because, according to  
him, the traditional approach does not help recognize the natural  
rhythm of a meter and is therefore unacceptable, though he  
acknowledges that it facilitates easy remembering . He has broken  
each meter into the naturally occurring यतिs in each. This is a major  
breaking away from the traditional approach.
