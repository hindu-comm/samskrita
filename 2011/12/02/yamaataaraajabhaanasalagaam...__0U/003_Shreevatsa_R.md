There's this article:

  

Kak, Subhash C. (2000). An Interesting Combinatoric Sutra.*Indian Journal of History of Science***35**, 123-127.  

<http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/knuth2.pdf>

  

in which the author talks about it and tries to trace it back, but he only gets as far as Charles Philip Brown's 1869 book "Sanskrit prosody and numerical symbols explained"<http://books.google.com/books/?id=bVn6YeJaCaUC>

  

Of course, it must be older if it was being taught to students in 1869, as reported by C. P. Brown, but I have also not been able to find any reference in Sanskrit literature.

  

At any rate, these sequences (de Bruijn sequences)seem to be discovered again and again independently in different fields and are known by different names.<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence>
