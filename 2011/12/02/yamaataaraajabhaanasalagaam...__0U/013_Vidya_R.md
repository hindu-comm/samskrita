Eddie,

  

True, True, it is not a Truth Table! It is just a binary list. My only excuse is that I didn't pay attention to a portion of my brain that kept nudging as I was sending off that email.

  

Most people, acquainted with binary tables and this gaNa classification would have done the same, as evidenced by a friend of mine who had independently done the rearrangement of the gaNas in just such a way.

  

MayAlan Turingcontinue to rest in peace, at-least, not be disturbed on my account.

  
Vidya
