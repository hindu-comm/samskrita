Yes. I too learnt the sUtra in Kannada prosody to remember the मात्रागण-s easily with its count of मात्रा-s for each गण of म-य-र-स-त-ज-भ-न which is following the order in वृत्तरत्नाकर for the name. Here it is said as being said in Sanskrit Grammar and much more which I could not comprehend:

But the formula in prosody in the लक्षण-s of the वृत्त-s is common will serve as the definition as well as it can serve as example to demonstrate the formula. But I do not know where it is stated in Grammar. But I have not come across in the works in prosody also. But none of the bloggers have given the source for the sUtra either in Grammar or Prosody, but all say it is extensively used in Sanskrit Grammar works or छन्दश्शास्त्र besides explain in a technical language I could not follow.

There are too many pages in Kannada and also ascribing it to Sanskrit Grammar or prosody in different languages.
