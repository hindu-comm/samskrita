I learnt the sequence yamaataaraajabhaanasa not in Sanskrit class but in  
Kannada class! It looks to me that there is no reference to it in any  
Sanskrit works on prosody. The sequence is also related to pseudo-random  
sequence \[(2 to the power of 3)-1\]. The pesudo-random sequence does not have  
"000" and is generated through linear shift registers.
