I passed SSLC from Karnataka. I was thought this mnemonic to remember the Gana's. I feel its just a mnemonic to remember Ganan's of prosody. Why create complicated meanings from this simple formula. Whether used by Kannada Mararthi or if there is a reference in Sanskrit prosody to this formula it doesn't matter .The formula is useful and can be used.
