namo namaH,

Quite simply, I am in a state of amazement. The sutra known by above  
name is known to be the earliest form of the so-called de Bruijn  
sequence.  
Please see: <http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/knuth2.pdf>

I was wondering if scholars can shed some light on occurrences of this  
formula in Sanskrit literature.

dhanyavAdaH.  
bhavadIyaH,  
kedAraH
