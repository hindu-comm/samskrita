Hari Aum,

namo namaH,



this is the notation for "Indravajra" chanda.

there are various chanda in our grammer, like Indravajra, Upendravajra, Anushtup (in which most of Bhagwadgita shloka are composed), Upajati, Shikharini, Mandankranta etc. Each chanda has its own notation (similar to raga in classical music ?).

scholars in our group may kindly throw more light please.

with best regards to all,
