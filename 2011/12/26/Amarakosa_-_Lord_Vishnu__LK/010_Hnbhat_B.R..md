The deification of seems to be deep rooted by the time of this anonymous verse was composed:

वेदः प्राचेतसादासीत् साक्षाद् रामायणात्मना॥

(attributed to अगस्त्यसंहिता)

glorifying रामायण the classical composition only next to वेद-s as it is claimed by many poets and honored with the title आदिकाव्य.

  



The workदशावतारचरित of क्षेमेन्द्रhowever,  has great  importance as it contains the earliest known reference to the Buddha being considered as an incarnation of विष्णु and the  narration

of the Buddha's life is an abridgment of the story as told in Buddhist works. The style shows maturity of conception, and is easy and flowing. The work was finished in the Laukika era 41 i.e. 1066

A.D. on the Tripurea Mountain."

The Kshemendra Studies - Suryakanta.

  

It may be the first known work to present the ten incarnations in the

exact order in which theyarc enumerated in the 49th verse of the Vishnupadadikesastotra of Sri Shankara.
