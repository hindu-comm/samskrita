Again that is one side of the debate. The Arya Samajis too deny any अवतारवाद (and भक्ति) in Vedas. Adi Shankara said Bhakti is अनुपलब्ध (note the difference from अविद्यमान).  
  
The प्रतिपक्ष is that अवतारवाद and भक्ति is present in all four Vedas and the Vishnu of the Vedas is the same as the Vishnu of the Puranas. For a detailed view of this position, please refer the work दयानन्दतिमिरभास्करः by ज्वालाप्रसादमिश्र in the 19th century - it is available on Archive.com.
