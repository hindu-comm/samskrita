Vishvanath Mahodaya:



Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa – canto 10 verse 44 says

44\. I, therefore, being born as the son of Dasaratha, will make

the heap of the lotuses of his heads become a fit oblation to the

battle-field with my sharp arrows.



RAvaNa was given a boon whereby he can only be killed by a mortal and not by the gods.



This is followed by:

51\. He held in his hands rice boiled with milk placed in a

vessel of gold, which was difficult to be borne even by him on

account of the entrance of the Primeval Being ( VishUu ) into it.

52\. The king accepted the food which was offered by that

Being of (connected with) PrajSpati, just as Indra did the essence

of the waters (AmVita), laid bare (manifested) by the ocean.

53\. That the merits of that king were such as were unattainable by others was declared by the fact that even He, the source

of the three worlds, desired to be his progeny.

54\. He divided the energy of VishVu designated as (in the

form of ) the sacrifical food between his two wives, just as the

lord of day (the Sun) divides the morning sunshine between the

Sky and the Earth.

55\. Kausaly^ was respected by him and Kaikeyi was his beloved (or favourite). He, therefore^ wished that Sumitri should

be honoured by them (by giving her a portion thereof ).

56\. The two wives of the king, knowing the mind (divining

the wish) of their husband, who was possessed of great

knowledge, gave (each) a half of their share of the Cham to her.



This is not the same thing as saying Rama was a avatara of Vishnu.
Vishnu entered the payasam, which came out of the yajna. This was divided equally in half between Kausalya and Kaikeyi – these two wives then both gave a half of their share (a quarter each of the total) to Sumitri.

All four brothers together are Vishnu, each is a quarter of Vishnu.

The Dasavatharam idea is not evident at all in this story. I believe this developed later.
