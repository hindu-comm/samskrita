Vimala Ji  
  
What you have mentioned below is only an opinion of some people and not necessarily true - it may have a lot of appeal to the rationalists and their ilk but it has no proof. To me this opinion is nothing but conjecture (in the language of non-believers) and मोह (in the language of believers). How can anybody possibly date an oral tradition like Vedas and Ramayana? There is no proof that Rama was deified later, or that Ramayana was written over several hundreds of years. There is no proof of the converse as well - no proof that Rama was deified in the Ramayana or that it was written by one person. In statistics, in absence of any significant evidence, ones conclusion is to not reject one's null hypothesis (or initial belief). The rationalists have a different null hypothesis, while the believers have a different one. That's the only difference.  
  
The concept of अवतार is noteworthy. The word means descension, when a deity descends to take a human form. If you believe in the concept (in other words, if your null hypothesis is that Avatara exists), then in the रामायण, the अवतार of श्रीराम is called नरहरि - He is both नर and हरि at the same time - poets like Valmiki (रामायण), Bhatti (भट्टिकाव्य) and Kalidasa (रघुवंश) focussed more on the नर part while poets like Vishwamitra (श्रीरामरक्षास्तोत्र), Agastya (अगस्त्यसंहिता), Vyasa (अध्यात्मरामायण), Sanatkumara (श्रीरामस्तवराजस्तोत्र), Kamban and Tulsidas focussed more on the हरि aspect. Some of these works are much older than middle ages). Even despite its focus on Rama as the human, there are numerous places in Ramayana where Valmiki directly or indirectly says that Rama is the complete Brahman.  
  
Meanwhile, the अवतारत्व or Avatarhood of Rama has been doubted by many characters in Ramayana itself which include Sati, Garuda, Jayanta (son of Indra), Ravana, et cetera, and has been doubted by many modern people like Kabir, Dayanand Saraswati, et cetera. But the doubts have been contradicted repeatedly by the likes of Ramanuja, Tulsidas, Jwalaprasad Mishra et cetera. The debate continues to this date, so what you have below is only one side of the argument.  
  
Regarding Krishna and Rama, both Sampradayas have existed for a long time and its incorrect to say that Krishna worship precedes Rama worship.
