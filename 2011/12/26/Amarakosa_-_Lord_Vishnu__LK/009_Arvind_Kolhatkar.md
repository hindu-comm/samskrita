Dr Bhat says: \<Very interesting. Rama came to be considered as  

incarnation at the time of  
the concept of दशावतार much later than Amarakosha, probably. Hence  
not  
deified at the time of Amarasimha in the lexicons. \>  
  

I notice that while Amarakosha devotes much attention to Krishna -  
several variations of Vishnu are names derived from episodes of  
Krishna's life, his conch and bow have a verse each, Balarama has two  
verses and Aniruddha has a verse to himself, all these in the  
Svargavarga - Rama, RavaNa, Seeta, Hanuman etc are not even  
mentioned. Buddha and Jina to find a mention in Svargavarga. Yet the  
concept of Dashavatar is absent.  
  
What is the period of the creation of the Dashavatar concept? It does  
not seem older than Amarasinha, who has been ascribed to the 4th  
century. (Please see the Introduction by K.G.Oka in his edition of  
Amarakosha with the commentary by Kshiraswamin.) Would it mean that  
the story of Dashavatar was created after the 4th century? Garuda  
Purana mentions 22 avatars. These include Dashavatars including Rama  
but excluding Buddha. Jayadeva (12 century) has the famous Dashavatar  
Ashtapadi.  
  
Can someone throw light upon the origin of the concept of Dashavatar  
or give pointers to it?
