What do other lexicographers give as synonyms of विष्णु? I mean मेदिनीकोश, धनञ्जयकोश, हलायुधकोश et cetera? Interestingly, most of these synonyms of Vishnu given by Amarasimha are also the names of Rama in the Ramastavarajastotra which is a form of Sanatkumara Samhita. Names like विष्णु, कृष्ण, विधु, ईशान, नारायण, वासुदेव, माधव, are to be found here. Several names are found in श्रीरामरक्षास्तोत्र as well which is ascribed to विश्वामित्र. As somebody pointed out, other अवतारs are not referred to as well.  
  
Also, some names can be explained in multiple ways like माधव. It can be either explained as मायाः लक्ष्म्याः धवः पतिः इति माधवः to mean विष्णु, or it can be explained as मधोर्भवः मधुः चैत्रमासः तस्मिन् जातः आविर्भूतः इति माधवः to mean राम.
