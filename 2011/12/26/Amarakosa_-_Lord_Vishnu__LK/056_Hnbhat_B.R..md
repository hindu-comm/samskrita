Vaijayanti 1.1. स्वर्गकाण्ड - आदिदेवाध्यायः - verses 20c-d to22c-d give the synonyms of राम. Yadavaprakasha, the author has been identified with the preceptor of SriRamanujacharya, the founder of Vishishtadvaita philosophy and is said to have lived in Kanchipuram:

Though त्रिकाण्डशेष refers to दशावतार, it there are not clear epithets of राम as in Vaijayanti:

The verse 29 does not contain specific mention of राम or दाशरथि. The next portion also do not contain 37-42 any reference explicitly to राम, though they collect many unknown epithets of Krishna and Balarama.

  

Thanks for pointing out to these two lexicons. Like Amarasimha, Purusshottamadeva also is said to be Buddhist by the editors of Trikandashesha. (c.14th century).
