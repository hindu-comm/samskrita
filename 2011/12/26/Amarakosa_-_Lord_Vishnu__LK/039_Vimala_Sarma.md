Dear Murthy Mahodaya

What you said about the incorporation of Buddha in Dasavathara is of interest to me.

*“Kshemendra who was much earlier to Jayadeva refers to Dasavatara including Buddha”*.

Could you please send me the sloka or the reference to Kshemendra’s Dasavatharam and approximate date?

Thank you

Vimala
