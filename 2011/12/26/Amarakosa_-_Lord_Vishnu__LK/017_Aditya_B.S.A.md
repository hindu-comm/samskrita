Quick addendum:

  

Original query was about Amarakosha. I took the original query to mean Mr. Murthy's post, where he mentioned that Rama's epithets were largely missing from Vishnu Sahasranamam.

  

Apologies to Dr. Bhat for misconstruing his statement as referring to Mr. Murthy's post.

  

Regards.
