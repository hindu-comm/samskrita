There is another popular verse on Dasavatara as told by my Guru which is as follows  
  
मत्स्यः कूर्मो वराहश्च नारसिंहश्च वामनः  
रामो रामश्च रामश्च बुद्धः कल्किरेव च  
  
It is interesting to note that Krishna is not mentioned as one of the avatara of Vishnu in this sloka. My Guru doesn't know the source of this sloka, but he says it is quite popular.
