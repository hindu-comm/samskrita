*Dear Vimala Ji*

*  
*

*If I use your logic, whenever the word*पार्थ or कौन्तेय occurs in Gita, Krishna is talking to all three sons of Kunti!! And whenever भारत occurs, Krishna is talking to all the princes in the battlefield as all are descendants of Bharata! That is not correct, there is something called context and something called traditional meaning.*I*nसोऽहं***दाशरथिर्भूत्वा, दाशरथि refers to Rama, and moreover it is used in the singular, not plural.*There has been a thread on*दाशरथि where it has been brought out that दाशरथि refers to Rama – it refers to the other brothers only when used in plural (Bhat Ji has quoted enough examples from Ramayana).*



As for M R Kale’s commentaries on Kalidasa’s works, they draw heavily from commentaries by Mallinath which are to the epics what Mahabhashya is to Panini grammar. So it is laughable that you give credence to Kale’s notes but not to Mallinath Tika. If you want to trivialize the commentary of Mallinath by saying any commentator can make any interpretation, be my guest, but that does not help your argument one bit. Mallinath’s interpretations are logical, grammatically derived, have stood test of time. Guess why? Because his commentaries were true to the text, fair to the authors and without any bias followed the principal of*नामूलं लिख्यते किञ्चित्. It is evident from the fact that despite being a Jaina, his commentaries on epics based on Hindu themes have become authorities. *



अलं पिष्टपेषणेन. Please consider the context, please use some logic and please interpret according to Paninian Grammar. I don’t have any issues with disagreeing with you, but if your interpretation is not supported by logic and grammar, it only provides entertainment value and nothing more.
