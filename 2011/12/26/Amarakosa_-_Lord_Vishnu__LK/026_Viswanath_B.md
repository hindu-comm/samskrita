Both amara-singha and kalidasa are part of the navratnas, in Vikramaditya's court. Kalidasa writes a big epic on rama's dynasty \[where rama is shown as Vishnu's avatar, canto 10, shloka 44\]. It clearly shows Rama is worshipped at that time.  
  
So it makes no sense to say amara-singha doesn't know about rama, or doesn't find it useful to put in his work.  
  
May be there must be some other thing that we are missing \[ as to why rama is not mentioned in amara-kosha\], may be there are prakshipta's, may be there are some lost parts ....i am just speculating...
