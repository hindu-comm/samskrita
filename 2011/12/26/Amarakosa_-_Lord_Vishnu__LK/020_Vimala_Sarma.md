Dear PanDitAs

The rAmayana was written over a period starting from about 500 BCE. The basic story existed in song form before this time and was sung by the bards before it was written. It was about a king and a hero but not about a deity. It was written as the first epic and the Mahabharatha was written later. The latter contained stories in which kRSNa was ambiguously depicted – both as a man and as a deity (example in the gItA). The Harivamsa, written as an appendix to MB, unequivocally made kriSHNa a deity with avathAras. Date for this is not clear, but could be early in the first millennium. At this time rAma was still considered a man. When idea of the avataras were first developed (perhaps from the Jaina tIrthankas), these avataras perhaps did not include either rAma or Buddha in the early stages. Rama was deified in the middle ages and became one of ViSNu’s avatAras. Parts of the Ramayana were changed or added to, reflecting this change in status. I think the first scheme to take kRSNa out (making him identical with ViSNu) and listing Buddha was in Jayadeva’s song.

Happy New year

Vimala
