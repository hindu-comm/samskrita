In VSN commentary, Sri Adi Sankara mentions one of Sri Rama's kalyANa  
guNas.  
  
Commentary of Adi Sankara on the Vishnu Sahasranama - सुमुखः  
  
Sumukhah : of good countenance  
  
Kaikeyi received the boon from Dasaratha that Rama was to go to the  
forest and  
her own son Bharata should rule the kingdom instead. So she called  
Rama and  
told him about the boon she received from king Dasaratha.  
  
Rama, on hearing that he was to go to the forest and not be crowned  
king,  
accepted it as if nothing had changed. There was absolutely no change  
of  
expression on his face !!  
  
Hence the name "Sumukhah".
