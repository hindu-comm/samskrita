Dear Murthy Mahodaya and Misra Mahodaya

Thank you both for your inputs to this thread.

I am just giving a chronological and historical explanation as to why rAma’s name and epithets do not occur as synonyms for Vishnu in Amarakosa. This is not to be interpreted as whether **I personally believe in the rAma avatar or not.

I agree that in the absence of firm dates we have to go by internal evidence.

rAma story is told in brief in the MB, but not vice versa, and Hanuman is referred to also - as in the story of the flower garden where Arjuna meets him (both sons of vAyu) and he on the flag of Arjuna’s chariot etc. So one can assume rAmAyaNa came first.

The is much evidence also for thinking that the story of rAma was originally a secular story and even at the time of kAlidAsa, it must have been secular because the raghuvamsa by K is also written as a secular story.

Anyway the fact of the epics being written at a set date by either one person or more does not detract from its significance for Hindus living at the present time.

Best wishes
