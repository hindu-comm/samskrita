Very interesting. Rama came to be considered as incarnation at the time of the concept of दशावतार much later than Amarakosha, probably. Hence not deified at the time of Amarasimha in the lexicons.

  

None of the names of other epic Mahabharata also do not appear in it. A notable point. While the Buddha and Jina epithets lead the way to wide discussions as in an earlier thread. Nor Matsya, kUrma, varAha, vAmana, etc. are also the incarnations among the ten incarnations, not included in the Amara lexicon. Krishna cult might be older than other Vaishnava cults based on पाञ्चरात्र आगम-s.
