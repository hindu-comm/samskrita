Dear Vimalaji,

Much of what youhave written about the origin of Ramayanis all conjecture and theorizing, which most would have read about.Internal evidences in Raamayan definitely point out that at the time the poet lived civilization was quite advanced and there were many kingdoms and cities whose dates can be fixed otherwise fairly accurately. Excepting Uttara Ramayan, bulk of the other six cantos would have been composed by one poet.

Jayadeva lived around 12th century. By that time dasavatara concept had crystallized. Bhagavata which was earlier refers to Buddha too. Trivikrama avatar is of Vedic origin. Alwars of South India sang about Krishna and Rama around 8th-9th century.Kshemendra who was much earlier to Jayadeva refers to Dasavatara including Buddha. In fact he has composed a kavya on the theme.

Wish you a Very Happy New Year.

आशास्महे नूतनहायनागमे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु जनाः सुशान्ताः ।

निरामयाः क्षोभविवर्जितास्सदा मुदा रमन्तां भगवत्कृपाश्रयाः ॥

Regards

Murthy
