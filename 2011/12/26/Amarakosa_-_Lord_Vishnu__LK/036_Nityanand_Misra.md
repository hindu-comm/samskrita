While this thread has strayed, I cannot resist writing this.  
  
Vimala Ji, you are contradicting yourself. First you give an \[unsourced\] meaning which quotes Vishnu saying "I being born as Dasaratha, will make ...". Then you say Rama \[and the three brothers\] are Vishnu. Then you say, this is not an Avatara. That is self-contradictory.  
  
Please refer Mallinatha's Sanjivani commentary introducing verse 10.44. Mallinatha says "तर्हि का गतिरित्याशङ्क्य **मनुष्यावतारेण** हनिष्यामीत्याह". Mallinatha, who is an authority on Kalidasa, unambiguously uses the word मनुष्यावतारेण and says that the purport of the following verse is "I will slay him by the means of a human Avatara."  
  
You are free to interpret Valmiki and Kalidasa in your own way but without any grammatical derivation, citations or convincing arguments your interpretations do not hold any weight.
