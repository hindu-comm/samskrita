Dear All,



Al Biruni in his travelogue written in the 11th Century about India - mentions Rama. There are several references to Krishna/ vasudeva, Mathura. Mahabharata, Harivamsa and 18 Puranas \[including Vishnu Purana\] are mentioned but there is no mention of Ramayana nor of Bhagavata. Among the festivals Janmashtami is mentioned \[though not by that name\], reference to Bali Pratipada as *Diboli* but not of *Naraka chaturdasi,* nor Deepavali the day of return of Vicotorious Rama.



There is no doubt that Ramayana and Rama worship were there prior to Al Biruni. Perhaps it was not as popular as Krishna to attract his attention.



Namaskaram
