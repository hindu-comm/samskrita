The same tone. If we consider history in BC or AC it would not be compatible with the Belief and Faith in our religious literature, created by Brahma, along with Veda-s AND PurANa-s which project the avatara-s of personal deities we worship. One cannot sail in two boats at a time. Either follow a chronology acceptable to the "corporate" world or to the Vedic Literature and Shastra-s in terms of yuga, manvantara, etc. or follow the faith in them being created by God. All could not be followed with equal footing in the three steams at a time and blame others for pointing out one or the other way of thinking.

  

This much only can be said in reply to Adithya's objection or remark. Anyway this doesn't have any bearing with the original query unless a formidable position is accepted. It is still unexplained why the name was omitted.
