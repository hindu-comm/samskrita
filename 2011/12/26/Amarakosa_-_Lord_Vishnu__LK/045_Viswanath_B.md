I'd like to add something, I mentioned Kalidasa, not for proof that Rama is an avatar. It was to say that Kalidasa mentions him so, but his alleged contemporary doesn't mention it.  
  
Priya,  
  
Bhagavata, does mention Rama as an avatar, infact brief story of ramayana is part of it.  
  
Thanks  
Viswanath
