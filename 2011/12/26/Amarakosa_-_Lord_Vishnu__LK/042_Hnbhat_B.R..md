As for Inscriptional evidence for the first reference of Buddha as the incarnation of Vishnu, I am told that there is one inscription of Pallavan Period at Mahabalipuram which contains a Dasavatara stotra. I am not able to get the source of this reference. If it is attested, the first reference would be in the 7th century AD. much earlier than Kshemendra.

  

I will revert on confirmation of the information soon or later.
