Hi Vimalaji,  
  
I was not trying to say anything about dasavatara at all, I was just mentioning that Raghuvamsa does portray Rama as Vishnu himself. Like your translation said, Vishnu says , " I being born as son of Dasaratha ....", does mean this. If there is a different definition of avatar, i stand excused for not knowing :-).  
  
on the topic that the 'navaratna' is not commonly agreed upon, I note with humor, that in a nation of more than a billion different minds, hardly anything is commonly accepted. I agree. We have no agreed upon history. In fact Vikramaditya himself is debated, despite the fact that we have been counting years every year for Vikrama shaka to celebrate him (or his victories).  
  
I was just trying to see if there is some other way to look at "why amara-singha doesn't mention rama".  
  
Viswanath
