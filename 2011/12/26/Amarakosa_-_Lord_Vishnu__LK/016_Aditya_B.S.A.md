नमो नम:

  

I thank you all for giving me the opportunity to explore your claims and my position further.

  

\<this doesn't have any bearing with the original query...\>

  

Reply to original query: In the Vishnu-Sahasranamam, names 391 to 421 (parardhih to parigrah) are Lord Rama's attributes.

  

A question may arise regarding the fact that most of these names are yougika, and need not necessarily connote Rama. There is plenty of material to explain how they connote this very avatar of Vishnu, viz. Dasaratha's son, Rama.

  

As to why Krishna's names find precedence, I think it would be rather obvious, given that the Vishnu Sahasranama was delivered by Bhishma, in the presence of Krishna and the Pandavas.

  

\<...unless a formidable position is accepted>

  

I believe I have stated my formidable position now. I am capable of providing the details to one who is willing to explore it. I respect differing views, while being firm in my understanding.

  

I maintain very clearly that one cannot reasonably consider the Dasavataram a 'created concept,' especially from an epistemological point of view, as it is incapable of being justified as such.

  

\<It is still unexplained why the name was omitted. \>

  

It is very clearly explained that the name was not omitted. If anyone choose to assume differently, I have no qualms about it.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
