For a believer, Rama is also an "avatar" of Vishnu, just like Parasurama and Balarama or Buddha. No more discussion is warranted with the poems which draw upon the Puranic outset of incarnation theory profusely, each Purana representing avatara-s - Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Vamana, Narasimha, Kalki etc. (but there is no other Purana, for Parasurama or Srirama except Ramayana, under discussion, which makes it different from the group and the exception of Bhagavata along with other 18 + 18 Purana-s ascribed to single authority Veda-vyasa) which do not withstand any discussion on the basis of commonly accepted x"ian Era but only Brahma created them at the time of creation along with the 4 Veda-s including Vedanga-s, Upaveda-s and allied Dharmasastra etc.

  

The question about not mentioning by Amarasimha, while he considers Krishna parallel to Vishnu, a Mahabharata and Bhagavata character or Purnavatara, as such, the name of Rama. The co-existence of Navaratna-s is a feeble base and even if it is accepted, as Vishwanath says, there is not any answer why he left him out of the names of God while Kalidasa considered him as the incarnation of Vishnu like that of Krishna.

  

The question has not moved any inch further and wrangling with the Avatara- concept or belief or a fact for long.
