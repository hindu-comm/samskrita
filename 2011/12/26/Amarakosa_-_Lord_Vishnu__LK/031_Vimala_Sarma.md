Niyananda Mahodaya

  
So what do you call such verses Vimala Ji? Valmiki's figment of imagination? Coincidence? Interpolation by Manuwadis?

  
See my earlier post:

Parts of the Ramayana were changed or added to, reflecting this change in status.



I am not saying that Ramayana is ***now*** a secular work – I am saying that it was when ***it was first written***.

I have no more to say on this subject. You are entitled to you views
