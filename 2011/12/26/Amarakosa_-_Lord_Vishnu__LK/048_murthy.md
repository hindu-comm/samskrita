Vimalaji,

I am sorry. My reply is delayed. Bhatji has already replied to you.

Dasavataracaritam of Kshemendra is published in Kavyamala series and is dowloadable (Scanned version). He has described Bauddhavatara in 74 verses and runs from page 151 to page 157. I am unable to send a copy. You could google for "Kavyamala series" and download it.
