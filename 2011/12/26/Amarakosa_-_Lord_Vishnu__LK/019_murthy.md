Dear Sri. Aditya,

It is a matter of regret that views of some of us has caused you discomfort. I believe this is a forum with broad shoulders that can suffer errors and divergence of views over a broad spectrum.

As to Vishnusahasranamam, I am aware of the interpretations of Shankara and Parasharabhatta and the divergence between them. You have rightly pointed out that the names interpreted as relating to Ramavatara have broad meanings. Quite clearly, in the manner in which episodes of Krishnavatara find a place in VSN, episodes of Ramavatara do not. Your observation that Bhishma was influenced by Krishna's presence is interesting. What we have in VSN ishow Vyasa conveys in his words to one and all what Bhishma is supposed to have spoken.

Warm regards

Murthy
