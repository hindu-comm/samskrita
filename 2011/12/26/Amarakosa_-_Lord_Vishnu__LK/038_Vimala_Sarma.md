Dear Nityananda Mahodaya

No this is not a contradiction – Vishnu said he will be born as son of Dasaratha in order to be mortal and kill rAvaNa – but he does not say which son. He is fact all four sons!! Nowhere is it stated in K’s
poem that rAma is an avatar. People are free to make whatever interpretations they like in commentaries..

See translation by MR Kale in this link; raghuvamsaofkali00kliduoft.pdf

But I cannot convince you – so please agree to disagree, and we can end this thread.

Vimala
