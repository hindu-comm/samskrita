Vimala Ji  
  
First of all it the Ramayana is not a "story" - calling it so would be trivializing it. It is not for nothing that the Ramayana and Mahabharata are called इतिहास (इति ह आस - thus definitely happened) to distinguish them from Puranas.  
  
Secondly, Valmiki's Ramayana is not a simplistic work that one can understand with Apte, Monier-Williams and Google Translate. The very first shloka by Valmiki मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां has been subject of centuries of thoughts and commentaries - what to talk about the गूढार्थ of the 24,000 verses! Vyasa and Tulsidas, et cetera, were not con-men to state that their works the अध्यात्मरामायण and रामचरितमानस were based Valmiki's work and still have Rama depicted as Brahman and episodes of Maya Sita, Kevata, et cetera revealed.  
  
Thirdly and finally, the Ramayana is secular only for the secularists and eminent historians on whom Sh. Arun Shourie has written in much detail in a book so I would not delve into that. For a neutral observer, there is tomes of evidence to show that the Rama of Valmiki Ramayana is the same as the औपनिषद ब्रह्म. Below are just some verses from Valmiki Ramayana (all references from Gita Press edition ) - I could find many more but then again अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत्  
  
१) व्यक्तमेष महायोगी परमात्मा सनातनः ।  
 अनादिमध्यनिधनो महतः परमो महान् ॥ ६-१११-११ ॥  
 Valmiki is no MBA to use hot-air words just like that, when he uses them he means them. It is not for nothing that he calls Rama as परमात्मा.  
  
२) सूर्यस्यापि भवेत्सूर्योह्यग्नेरग्निः प्रभोः प्रभोः ।  
 श्रियश्च श्रीर्भवेदग्र्या कीर्त्याः क्षमाक्षमा ॥ २-४४-१५ ॥  
 दैवतम् दैवतानाम् च भूतानाम् भूतसत्तमः ।  
 तस्य केह्यगुणा देवि वने वाप्यथवा पुरे ॥ २-४४-१६ ॥  
Rama is the Surya for even the Surya, the God for the Gods, .... and so on.  
  
३) The whole canto 117 of Yuddha Kanda is the glorious divinity of Rama, revealed at the end of the मूलरामायण (six cantos). It has many important Sutras like जगत्सर्वं शरीरं ते which echo the औपनिषद proclamations in बृहदारण्यक like यस्य पृथिवी शरीरं, यस्यापः शरीरं, यस्यान्तरिक्षः शरीरं, यस्य वायुः शरीरं and which form the basis of विशिष्टाद्वैत which considers the entire universe to be an embodiment of Brahman.  
  
So what do you call such verses Vimala Ji? Valmiki's figment of imagination? Coincidence? Interpolation by Manuwadis?  
  
The proof is right there if one wants to see it, but if one's eyeglasses are tinted with secularism then everything will appear secular. For the आस्तिक, no proof is required and for the नास्तिक, no proof is sufficient.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
