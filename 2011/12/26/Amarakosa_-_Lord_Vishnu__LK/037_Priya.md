Along the lines of this discussion, I found the Bhagavata Purana's  
account of  
the avataras also very curious. While saying there are innumerable  
descents  
of the Lord, it does mention 22 avataras individually. Most of these  
are mentioned  
by name, but not Rama. We just infer that he is the one being referred  
to because  
the bridging of the ocean is mentioned. It seems like somewhat cursory  
treatment.  
In fact, an avatar by name Rama is mentioned, but it refers to  
Balarama.  
Also, Vedavyasa is mentioned as an earlier incarnation of the Lord  
(prior to his  
descent as Rama), messing up the chronology as we know it. Perhaps  
someone  
here can throw some light on the account of the avataras in the  
Bhagavata.  
  
Regards,  
Priya
