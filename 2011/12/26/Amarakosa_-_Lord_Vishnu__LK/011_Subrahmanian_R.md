Themes from Ramayana have been used and elaborated by Poet Bhasa (variously estimated between 1st and 4th Century AD) in Pratimanataka and by Kavi Kalidasa \[age probably 4th to 6th Century AD\] in his famous Raghuvamsa. It is possible that Amarakosa preceded these. Though the Ramayana incident is much older than the Mahabharata event, it appears that Ramayana is later to Mahabharata or at least, Ramayana became popular after popularity of Mahabharata.



While Adi Sankara wrote commentaries on Bhagavadgita, Vishnu Sahasranama and Sanatsujatiya - all from Mahabharata, he has not composed any commentary for any portion of Valmiki Ramayana \[like the Aditya hridayam - Agastya's advice to Lord Rama\]
