Dear list,  
  
the linguistic program SanskritTagger is now available as freeware at  
<http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php?content=sanskrit_tagger_download>  
  
SanskritTagger has been used to build the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit.  
Please refer to  
<http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php?content=sanskrit_tagger>  
for a very short introduction into the (technical) background of the  
program and for some links to papers describing it.  
  
Some additional remarks:  
\* The download consists of two parts: the program itself and the  
database. Although the database is zipped, it is still quite large  
(\~250 MB), so you should download it over a fast internet connection.  
\* Some less important parts of the user interface and of the help file  
are still in German. These parts will be translated into English in  
the next releases of the program.  
\* If you have questions about how to use the program or some of its  
functions, you may post them in the discussion forum found at  
<http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php?content=messageboard>  
\* Finally, to answer one of the most frequently asked questions right  
here: SanskritTaggger is built for Windows, and the program relies  
quite heavily on Windows APIs. I do not know whether it is possible to  
run the program on another operation system.  
  
Hope it helps to promote the computational processing of Sanskrit!  
  
Best regards,  
Oliver Hellwig
