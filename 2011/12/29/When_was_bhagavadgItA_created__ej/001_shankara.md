Kolhatkarji,

  

I would like to share my humble observation in this regard.  

  

It could be safely assumed that the Gita existed as a scripture prior to Sri Sankaracharya based on various comments of the acharya in his Gitabhashya. In the beginning of 3rd chapter, Acharya replies to the views of an opponent who, Anandagiri explains, is an earlier commentator of the Gita. This means that commentaries on the Gita existed even before Sri Sankaracharya, though none of these commentaries have survived till today.

  

regards  
shankara
