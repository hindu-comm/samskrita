Dear Group,

This question was obliquely touched in an earlier discussion about the  
गीताध्यान स्तोत्र a few months ago but was lost track of in the other  
discussion. I am raising it here again as I would like to get a  
satisfactory answer to it.

By the word 'created' I do not mean who wrote it or when. The answer  
to that question will be the same as the answer to the 'creation' of  
महाभारत, of which गीता forms a part.

My question is 'when was गीता distinguished, out of thousands of other  
verses and portions of महाभारत, as a separate piece of text,  
distilling the essence of Indian Philosophical systems'.

It certainly is known as such from the time शंकराचार्य wrote his भाष्य  
on it. In that sense शंकराचार्य would be its 'creator' because the  
veneration of गीता started from his period, unless someone else had  
done it prior to शंकराचार्य.

Do we know of any other work prior to the भाष्य by शंकराचार्य that had  
placed गीता on a pedestal of its own, by distinguishing it as a  
important body of verses?
