Much before the commentaries, Rishi Vyasa himself wrote in the महाभारत -  
  
गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या किमन्यैः शास्त्रसंग्रहैः  
या स्वयं पद्मनाभस्य मुखपद्माद्विनिःसृता  
  
Lord Krishna in the Gita itself talks about the greatness of Gita from 18.68 to 18.71.  
  
On when it was 'created' \[sic\] or popularized, [Swami Akhandananda Saraswati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhandanand), one of the greatest exponents of Bhagavata and Gita in the 20th century, considered the question irrelevant since that is like asking what is nectar made of, where does it come from instead of drinking it endlessly. You may want to refer the book दैनिक जीवन में गीता published by on his views on the question of origin of गीता. Published by Sat Sahitya Prakashan Trust and more details on <http://anandvrindavan.freeservers.com/custom2.html>.
