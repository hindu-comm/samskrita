Dear list,  
  
a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit has been released at  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php>  
  
Additions and features:  
\* Book 12 of the Mahabharata completed  
\* Word clouds for a fast overview of central terms in a text; found at  
the query page (<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/>  
index.php?contents=abfrage)  
  
The tagging program with which the corpus has been created will be  
released as freeware in the next days. I will post a message with  
download details.  
  
Looking forward to meet some of you at the World Sanskrit Conference  
in Delhi!  
  
Best regards,  
Oliver Hellwig
