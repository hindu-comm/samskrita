Contextually they would mean the same. In Ramayana it refers to the right of a Brahmin, who has loaned money to another person to go and sit before the latter's house, perhaps starving,demanding the return of money. In Raghuvamsa it refers to an old man (Aja in this case)suffering from diseasesdenying himselffood till his death.
