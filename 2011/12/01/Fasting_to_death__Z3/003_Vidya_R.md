To add some depth to what has been stated:

  

Why specifically a Brahmin, and why not any person who needs to redeem his loan? - The reason for this is that when a person lets a brahman wait at one's own door, without food or water, he incurs sin. This is illustrated in kaThopaniShad, where Nachiketas visits the abode of Yama.
Yama returns after a gap of three days, and is mortified to learn about this sin perpetrated by him, and to atone for it, he grants him three boons. This and the rest of it, as we know, is the content of this upanishad.

  

तिस्रोरात्रीर्यदवात्सीर्गृहेमे

अनश्नन्ब्रह्मन्नतिथिर्नमस्यः ।

नमस्तेऽस्तुब्रह्मन्स्वस्तिमेऽस्तु

तस्मात्प्रतित्रीन्वरान्वृणीष्व ॥१.९॥

  

The reason for why it is a sin to make a learned person wait (other than common courtesy, and traditional respect accorded to learned people) is probably somewhere else, and I will be interested to know if somebody can provide that information. - This is of-course, over and above the subject of the email.
