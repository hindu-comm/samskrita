This was the reason given in Kathopanishat:

Having been told that he will be gifted to Yama, the God of Death, Nachiketas went to a secluded place and thought:

**  
Mantra 5:****बहूनामेमि**Among many students I rank प्रथमो highest
**बहूनामेमि**Among many**मध्यमः**I rank as belonging to the middling.  
**किं**what**स्विद्यमस्य**indeed Yama has ktRVy any purpose**यन्मयाद्य करिष्यति**that my father can achieve through me.  
  
Among many I am the first; or among many I am the middlemost. But certainly I am never the last. What purpose of the King of Death will my father serve today by thus giving me away to him?  
  
Nachiketas is a very positive-thinking boy. He has complete confidence in himself, his abilities. He cannot see himself as lagging behind. So he makes a self-assessment of himself as someone most of the time ranking highest among his classmates. At the most he allows himself a middling position but never the back-bencher. 'Despite my being a front-ranker my father has decided to give me away to the Lord of death. What purpose indeed of Yama does my father intend to fulfill by giving me to him? Certainly, without expecting anything in return from Yama, just in a fit of anger has my Father uttered those words of sending me away to him.' Nachiketas sees his father is now in a repentant mood for having uttered those harsh words. Deciding that even those words uttered by the Father should not become futile, Nachiketas addressed his Father, with a view to console him:  
**  
  
Mantra 6:****अनुपश्य**Consider**यथा पूर्वे**the way your forefathers behaved**प्रतिपश्य तथा परे**and consider also how the others behave now.**सस्यमिव **Just like corn**मर्त्यः**man पच्यते decays**सस्यमिवाजायते पुनः**and is reborn like corns sprouting.  
  
Nachiketa said: Look back and see how it was with those who came before us and observe how it is with those who are now with us. A mortal ripens like corn and like corn he springs up again.  
  
The young boy Nachiketas now addresses his father: Recall to mind the conduct of your ancestors. Their ways have to be followed by you as well. Also see how the noble minded of the present times behave. They too are worthy of emulating. In all of their dealings one can never find contemptible behavior. It is only the ignoble that behave contrary to the adorable ones. One can never hope to attain to immortality by disgraceful conduct. Mortal man dies and is born again even as plants die and sprout. Returning to this world of mortals is no praiseworthy endeavor. Go ahead and stick to your words. Send me to the abode of Yama, the Lord of Death.  
  
Nachiketas has virtually delivered a sermon to his father who could protest no longer. He sent his boy to the world of Yama. Reaching Yama's residence, Nachiketas, finding that Yama was away refused to enter the mansion. He opted to remain outside, refusing even food, spending three nights in waiting. This shows he was endowed with immense forbearance,*titikShA*, involving his remaining without food, outside the house. We have already seen his concern for his father's welfare. These are some of the qualities that favour a spiritual aspirant.  
Nachiketas was observing the custom of a male not entering and staying in another's house if the man of the house was away. Eventually Yama returned from his circuit. Reporting Nachiketas' arrival and waiting, Yama's household gives him a piece of advice on what is to be done to welcome Nachiketas:  
**  
  
Mantra 7:****वैश्वानरः**verily fire**प्रविशति**enters**गृहान्**houses**ब्राह्मणः**in the form of a Brahmin**अतिथिः**guest **तस्यैतां**him this kind of**शान्तिं**propitiation**कुर्वन्ति**do हर fetch**वैवस्वत**O son of vivasvAn**उदकम्**- water.   
  
Verily, like fire a*brahmin*guest enters a house; the householder pacifies him by giving him water and a seat. Bring him water. O King of Death!  
When a*brahmin*guest arrives at a house, it is verily the God of Fire,*vaishvAnara*that comes in his form. The idea is this: the brahmin who has a lot of power born of austerity, tapas, is capable of bringing prosperity or destruction to the house where he enters. It is therefore incumbent upon those who receive him to pacify him by the appropriate protocol. He is given water for washing his feet, offered a seat of honor, etc. This is the method of noble householders in respect of a*brahmin*guest. Therefore, remind the people of Yama's household that he, Yama, fetch water to conduct the*brahmin*guest, Nachiketas, into the house, with due honor. In case there is a lapse in this, or such a protocol is ignored, the scripture warn of accrual of sin for the householder. What befalls such an errant householder? In reply comes the next mantra:

**  
Mantra 8**:  
  
**आशा-प्रतीक्षेसंगतंसूनृतांच  
इष्टा-पूर्तेपुत्र-पशूंश्चसर्वान्।  
एतद्वृङ्क्तेपुरुषस्यअल्पमेधसः  
यस्यअनश्नन्वसतिब्राह्मणोगृहे॥8॥**

**  
आशा-प्रतीक्षे**- hopes and expectations**संगतं**- the reward of his intercourse with pious people**सूनृतां च**- the merit of his kindly speech**इष्टा-पूर्ते**- the good results of his sacrifices and beneficial deeds**पुत्र-पशूंश्च सर्वान्**- and his cattle and children as well**एतद्वृङ्क्ते**- destroys these**अनश्नन् वसति ब्राह्मणो**- The*brahmin*who dwells , fasting**गृहे**- in a house**यस्य पुरुषस्य अल्पमेधसः**- that foolish householder's (house).

  

That is why he is called Agni, in another verse. But whether one agrees with this view or not, is a different thing. This really is called प्रत्युपवेशन in the context of Ramayana too, to get one's demand fulfilled using this weapon conveniently by him (due to the above belief) at his disposal and not by others. Kings are able to get anything by force or law as every valuable things are belonging to the state (Kings) according to some source (which I right now not remember).

  

The case of Raghuvamsha seems to be a different case ending one's life by fasting, similar to the one popular in Jain muni's as सल्लेखनव्रत pointed out in an earlier thread with this subject. This is the second or third time, if I am right. Whether both could be conveyed by the same term is a point to be consulted further in other sources and the commentaries on RV also. Probably a portion of commentary was quoted in the earlier thread.

  

Here is the link to the earlier thread:

And this was another thread with the same topic:

in which "sallekhana" is mentioned in connection with प्रायोपवेशन and in this context of RAghu, it can be equal to this ""sallekhana" or "praayopaveshana" in meaning.
