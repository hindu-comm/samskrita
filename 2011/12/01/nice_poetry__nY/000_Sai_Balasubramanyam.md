रामकृष्णविलोमाकाव्यं - A rare palindromic poetry.

Sanskrit is famous for certain specialities, one of them being the Palindrome like "विकटकवि".  
This poetic composition, which was written by the scholarDyvagyna Surya Panditain the 14th Century, is a marvelous example of palindromic verses.

It also has another speciality - This set of poems, when read forward relate to Rama and the Ramayana, and when read in reverse relate to Krishna and the Mahabharata.



(Forward) तं भूसुतामुक्तिमुदारहासं वन्दे यतो भव्यभवम् दयाश्रीः ।



“I pay my homage to Him who rescued Sita, whose laughter is captivating, whose incarnation is

grand, and from whom mercy and splendor arise everywhere.”



(Backward) श्रीयादवं भव्यभतोयदेवं संहारदामुक्तिमुतासुभूतम् ॥



“I bow before that Sri Krishna, the descendent of Yaadava family; who is a divinity of the sun as

well as the moon; who destroyed Putana who only gave destruction; and who is the soul of all

this universe.”
