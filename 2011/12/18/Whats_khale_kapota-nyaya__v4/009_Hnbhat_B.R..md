One more collection of different sources explaining the same Nyaya in different contexts:

  

> No. 135  
> khale kapotanyAyaH \|  
> The simile of pigeons alighting on a threshing-floor. Used by writers > on Ala\~NkAra to illus  
> trate the production of a certain effect by the simultaneous action of > numerous causes. In SA  
> hityadarpaNa (739) we read:  
> "Samuccayo.ayam ekasmin sati kAryasya sAdhake. Samuccayo.ayam ekasmin > sati kAryasya sAdhake.  
> Khale kapotikAnyAyAt tatkaraH \|syAt paro.api cet. Khale > kapotikAnyAyAt tatkaraH \|syAt paro.api cet."  
> "The conjunction is when notwithstanding the existence of one cause > sufficient to bring a  
> bout an effect, there are represented others producing the same, > according to the maxim of t  
> he Threshing-floor and the pigeons". See this, also, very concisely > put, in Ala\~NkArasarvasva

> nAtha on MAgha x. 16, and in NyAyamAlAvistara 11. 1. 3.

No.135 of 485 Nyaya-s explained in "Laukikanyanjali" :

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_trial/laukikacorrected.txt>

  

Needs some more correction for diacritical marks encoding. Otherwise very fine explanations by Jacob are fine and annotated comprehensively by the editors as can be seen in the above extract. The encodings for Sanskrit are in iTrans and difficult to read.

Here is the link for Nyayavali. Sankar has the same in his site of ebooks.
