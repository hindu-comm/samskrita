The maxim of the barn of corn and the pigeons.





As all kinds of pigeons, young and old, go flying into a barn and help themselves to the corn therein to their hearts' content, so this maxim is used to denote that all kinds of men repair to a great man's place to fulfil theirown ends.

  

This is used to denote the simultaneous syntactic relation in a sentence with all the words to give the sentence meaning as a whole according to Nyaya system of verbal cognition.

  

वृद्धा युवानः शिशवः कपोताः खले यथामी युगपत् पतन्ति।

तथैव सर्वे युगपत् पदार्थाः परस्परेणान्वयिनो भवन्ति।।

  

Quoted in Bhashapariccheda of Vishvanatha Nyayapancanana Bhattaacharya in his commentary as alternative opinion.
