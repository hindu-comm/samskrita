Yes, indeed, नः क्ये is a नियमसूत्र and not an अपवादविधिसूत्र as I had mentioned earlier. There is a small difference between the two (perhaps the reason behind my confusion earlier) - while a नियमसूत्र restricts the domain (प्रवृत्तिक्षेत्र) of a normal सूत्र somewhat, the अपवादविधिसूत्र totally eclipses the उत्सर्गविधिसूत्र in the former's domain. Thanks for pointing this out.  
  
I came across a slightly different definition of नियमसूत्र as सिद्धे स्त्यारम्भमाणो विधिर्नियमाय भवति in the श्रीधरमुखोल्लासिनी commentary by गोविन्दप्रसादशर्मा.
