Only comment needs that the next नः क्ये is not an अपवाद for the first, but it is a नियम sUtra, which restricts the पद to only to those ending with "n" before क्यच्, क्यङ्, क्यष् suffixes which are added to सुप आत्मनः क्यच्, etc. to सुबन्त-s. The examples are राजीयति, चर्मायते etc. Counter examples are वाच्यति, etc. The principle is "सिद्धे सत्यारम्भो नियमार्थः।  

\`*येन नाप्राप्ते*यो विधिरारभ्यते स तस्यापवादः' इति न्यायः।"

  

The others are अपवाद-s to the technical term भ defined in{यचि भम् (१।४।१८) as you have rightly observed. 

स्वादिष्वसर्वनामस्थाने is the second definition of पद which is not covered under the first definition.
