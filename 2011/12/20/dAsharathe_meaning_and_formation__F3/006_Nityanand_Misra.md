Both forms are correct. Apte's dictionary lists both and gives the same meaning.  
  
दशरथ + इञ् results in दाशरथिः. The sutra is अत इञ् \[तस्याऽपत्यं\] (४.१.९५).  
  
दशरथ + अण् results in दाशरथः. The relevant sutras are ४.१.११२ to ४.१.११९ which show when the अण् suffix is to be used for the offspring.  
  
Now, I disagree with Shreevatsa Ji's statement. There are no mistakes in the language of Valmiki or Vyasa. What appear to be mistakes are either आर्ष/छान्दस प्रयोग or what is called अपाणिनीय प्रयोग (remember there are nine schools of grammar, and eight preceded Panini), or mistakes in our interpretation since we often are unable to grasp the गूढार्थ. Valmiki and Vyasa are सिद्धकविs, they cannot make mistakes.  
  
I am reminded of an anecdote which was recited to me by Swami Avimukteshwarananda Saraswati, a close disciple of the Shankaracharya of Dwarika Swami Swaroopananda Saraswati. A man came to a temple of Shiva and said "गौरीशंकराभ्यांनमामि". People interpreted it as "गौरीशंकराभ्यां नमामि", started laughing saying the person does not know that नमामि goes with the accusative so it should be "गौरीशंकरौ नमामि" (I bow down to Gauri and Shankara). The man said I meant "गौरीशं कराभ्यां नमामि" (I bow down to the Lord of Gauri with both \[folded\] hands). Lot of times, the limitations of our interpretation make us think there are mistakes, when there are none.
