Incidentally I was discussing this very point with a teacher... Since both derivations 'dAsharathi' and 'dAsharathA' are valid, I was wondering if one of them actually stood for a 'purusha vishesha.' Like, for example, 'shUrpaNakhA' stands only for Ravana's sister, whereas 'shUrpanakhI' stands for anyone who has nails like shUrpas.

  

Similarly, can it be said that 'dAsharathI' stands only for Raja Dasharatha's son, Rama, while 'dAsharatha' could stand for anyone so described?
