Thanks, that is informative.

Yes, in that case there are no mistakes by definition. :-)

  

I agree; "mistake" was the wrong word to use. I should have said there exist forms in the epics that are different from those indicated by Panini's grammar. As you said, they can be calledआर्षप्रयोग,छान्दस प्रयोग or अपाणिनीय प्रयोग... thanks again. Either way, the point is that we mortals cannot always use the forms in the epics to decide what is "correct" according to Panini's grammar.
