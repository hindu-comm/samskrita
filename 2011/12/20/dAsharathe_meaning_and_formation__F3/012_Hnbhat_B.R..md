Very interesting observations. The question had been raised already in Kashika commentary and the commentators justify in two ways. दशरथस्यायम् \[पुत्र:\] - दाशरथः, तस्मै; "तस्येदम्" इत्यण्। but the meaning his son Rama is being implied and not directly denoted by the word though grammatically correct.

  

The grammatical form giving directly the son of दशरथ will be दाशरथिः, तस्मै - दाशरथये would mean any son of दशरथ, but the context restricts it to his elder son राम who broke the शैवधनु.

  

सैष दाशरथी रामः

  

would be perfect usage, in spite of दाशरथि implying the son of दशरथ.

  

This is attested by the usage of Valmiki:\\

  

Rām, Bā, 73, 22.2  
rāmaṃ**dāśarathiṃ**rāmo jāmadagnyo 'bhyabhāṣata //

  

"Rama, the son of Jamadagni, said to Rama, the son of Dasaratha."

  

Otherwise there is no compelling restriction to elder son only.

  

-   Rām, Yu, 9, 21.2  
    sṛjatyamoghān viśikhān vadhāya te
    pradīyatāṃ**dāśarathāya**maithilī //  
    [Context](http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=177036) -   Rām, Yu, 9, 22.2  
    prasīda jīvema saputrabāndhavāḥ pradīyatāṃ**dāśarathāya**maithilī
    //  
    [Context](http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=177038) -   Rām, Yu, 16, 29.2  
    alaṃ virodhena śamo vidhīyatāṃ pradīyatāṃ**dāśarathāya**maithilī
    //

Otherwise, it can be justified as आर्ष or अपाणिनीय than grammatical mistake as suggested by Srivathsa. Here is the usage of Valmiki using the word for both Rama and Lakshmana:

  

Rām, Yu, 67, 31.2  
tatastato**dāśarathī**sasṛjāte 'stram uttamam //

  

Thanks to Nithyananda Mishra for raising the issue.

  

By the way,
