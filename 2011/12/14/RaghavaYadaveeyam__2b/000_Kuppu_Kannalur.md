Dear All,

Such works of geniuses go unsung... If you have not come across this work.

  
The author Sri Venkatadhvari was born at Arasanipalai near Kancheepuram and  
was the follower of Sri Vedanta desikan. He had mastery in poetry and  
rhetoric. He had composed 14 works, the most important of them being

Lakshmisahasram by composing which he got back his lost eyesight.

The present work Raghavayadhaveeyam comprises of 30 verses and deals with

the story of Rama and Krishna together by adopting the style of anuloma and

prathiloma, that is, reading each stanza as such and in reverse order, the

former telling the story of Rama while the latter narrating the story of

Krishna. Hence this work actually consists of 60 slokas in all.
