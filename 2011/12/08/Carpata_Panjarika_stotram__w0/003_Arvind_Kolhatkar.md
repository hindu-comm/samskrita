This stotra, variously known as चर्पटपञ्जरिकास्तोत्र or  
मोहमुद्गरस्तोत्र, with varying number of shlokas, is traditionally  
attributed to AadiShankaraacaarya. As there have been a few hundred  
Shankaraachaaryaas over the last 1200 years, it is quite likely other  
Shankaraachaaryaas are confused with AadiShankaraacaarya in the matter  
of ascribing authorship to this as also to several other stotras. Is  
there any sure way of resolving this conundrum?
