This is from the book "The wonder that is Sanskrit". This particular shloka is mentioned in the chapter Interesting and Amazing creations in Sanskrit. It is available online -  
  
<http://www-roc.inria.fr/who/Ramakrishna.Upadrasta/Sanskrit/14339015-The-wonder-that-is-Sanskrit.pdf>

  

Do read it for many more brilliant and amazing creations.

  

Thanks,

Nitin
