Both are correct in a way. Precisely the ruleadenguNaH simply mentions that technical term guNa denotes the short "a" and e, o vowels. In that Vasu is correct.

  

Next the rule also prescribes when a is followed by any ac, in saMhitA, guNa substituted for both a+i. This is the precise meaning for the rule. guNa is substitute for a+i, a+u. a+R - ar

  

This is what you see in the examples. sthAnE'ntaratamaH makes the substitute obligatory for the substitution the qualities prayatna closer to the that they are substituted. Here, there are a single guNa vowel is applied in the place of two vowels - a + i, a+u. So the guNa should have the prayatna-s of both a+ i, and a + u respectively. Of the three guNa-s, only first and second have the prayatna-s of both and "e" is substituted for the first and "o" is substituted for the second as they are having the prayatna-s of both. This is what makes them respectively apply to the saMhitA. The other vowels are covered in the next rules, which exclude these cases of guNa. limiting to i, u R and lR.

  

vRddhir eci, akaH savarNe dIrghaH.

  

  

Our friend Vaidya is also correct in that guNa and v

Riddhi are spplicable to i, u, R, L \[k\] but needs some more modification.

And iko guNavRddhI directs the substitution where guNa vRddhi are prescribed without prescribing any specific sthAni. vowel and simply mentioning "sici vRiddhiH". In this case, the sthAni is specifically directed as "ekaH pUrvaparayoH" which makes guNa applicable for ar and al for the vowels a+R and a+LR. and hence "iko guNavRuddhI" does not apply here as Nityanandaji has suggested. There are no other vowels left and when other vowels are the pUra and para, vRddhi, and savarNa dIrgha are prescribed both both in the subsequent sUtra-s which invalidates the application of the rule for guNa in those cases.

  

Now finally, it makes the "prayatna" of the guNa-s which is applicable to which according to the combination of the efforts of both vowels as required by the rule "sthAne'ntarama".
