The sutra is "iko gu.nav.rddhii" which says that the [gu.na](http://gu.na) happens to ik, that is i, u, .r and .l (not to a, i, u). Then "sthaane antaratama.h" implies that [gu.na](http://gu.na) of i is e, of u is o, of .r and .l is a. By "ura.n rapara.h" the [gu.na](http://gu.na) of .r and .l become ar and al.
