In many of the भाष्य, टीका, टिप्पणि etc, the word सति is frequently used, as in Srimat Lalitaa laalita mahodaya's टिप्पणि first line ’. . . . . सति अनेन शब्देनायं बोध्य इति". I am unable to understand this simple and frequently occurring word. I will be thankful if someone can enlighten me on this.
