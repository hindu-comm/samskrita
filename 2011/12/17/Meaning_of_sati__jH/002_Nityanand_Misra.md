Now the गूढार्थ (hidden meaning). The lovers of Kṛṣṇa chant "Rādhe Rādhe" (meaning O Rādhā! O Rādhā!) every now and then while speaking. Those devoted to Rāma chant "Sīte Sīte" (meaning O Sītā! O Sītā)
whenever they get a cough or yawn. These Vaiyākaraṇas are similarly the Sādhakas of Śiva (remember the Śiva Sūtras which form the base of all Sanskrit grammar, came from the Ḍamarū of Śiva), hence thay chant "Sati Sati" (meaning O Satī! O Satī!) in between the gush of their grammatical genius, to keep the divine inspiration going. Also you know that Satī, Pārvatī, Lalitā are all the forms the primordial energy and mother, so Śrīmallalitālālita is also Śrīmatsatīlālita and now you know another reason. :)  
  
Of course the Vaiyākaraṇas want to protect their secrets like a powerful Mantra. So when confronted, they explain it as the singular locative case of सत् + शतृ which could mean "upon the existence of", or "when something has been done". They also use it only at those ocassions where such a meaning makes sense, so that they don't have to share the secret behind their geniuses. Why, they even fooled poor Sir Monier Monier-Williams into writing that as the first meaning of Satī. :) :)  
  
So, get the word "Sati" and chant it a lot, and that's the key to writing the beautiful commentaries these Vaiyākaraṇas come up with in a jiffy. :) :) :)  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
