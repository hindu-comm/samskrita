Sir,

  

Thanks for your kind reply. I had searched in Apte's 'Students English Sanskrit dicctionary'. In addition to some of the equivalents given by you, he gives समकालीन पुरुषाः for 'current generation', and पूर्वे पुरुषाः for past generation. Could we say पूर्वान्वयः or पूर्वपरम्परा for past generation? Will it be accurate?



regards  
shankara
