Vidyaji,

  

Thank you for this suggestion.  

  

समवर्तिन् is used in Hindi also, but with a slightly different meaning. In Hindi it means "contemporary". Thus we can have 3 words समवर्तिन्, पूर्ववर्तिन् and अनुवर्तिन् to mean a person who is contemporary, predecessors and successors. Yet, it will not exactly give the connotation of "generation" in English.



regards  
shankara
