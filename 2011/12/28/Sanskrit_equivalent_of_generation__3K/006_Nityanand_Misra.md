Some of entries in Apte's Students Sanskrit English dictionary appear contrived or synthetic. I remember my father (a biochemist) was looking to translate the technical term "revitalization" some years ago. He looked up Apte and it said पुनर्नवीनीकरण or something similar. He finally settled for कायाकल्प, which is not an exact linguistic translation, but better represented the idea. Similarly समकालीनपुरुष looks artificial, while परम्परा (or युग if you mean today's age by today's generation) might fit better. A generation leap can then be aptly called युगान्तर.
