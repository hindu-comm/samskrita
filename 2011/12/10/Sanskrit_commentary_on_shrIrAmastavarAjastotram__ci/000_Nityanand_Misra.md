Namaste,*  
  
Śrīrāmastavarājastotram* is a 100-verse *Stotram* in Sanskrit extolling *Śrīrāma* which is very popular in the *Rāmānanda Sampradāya*. Believed to have been composed by *Ṛṣi Nārada*, it is a part of the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā*. A Sanskrit commentary by Swami Rambhadracharya (along with Hindi translation) titled *Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam* on the *Śrīrāmastavarājastotram* was published by the Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas on January 14, 2001. A scan of the book is now available on the author's site. The PDF can be downloaded from [here](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/downloads%20) or directly from [here](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/ViewContent/pdfs/Jagadguru%20Rambhadracharya%20-%20Sriramastavarajastotre%20Sriraghavakrpabhasyam.pdf) (238 pages, 7 MB).  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
