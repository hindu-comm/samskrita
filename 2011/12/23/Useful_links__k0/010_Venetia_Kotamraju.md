Happy Christmas and new year to everybody.

Thank you to everyone who has sent links.

I have also been collecting links over the last couple of years from this group and others to which I belongand now have a long Word document which needs to be edited and properly organised. I will endeavour to add links whichothers have sentthat are not on my list to the Word document and then circulate. I am also hoping to createa list of all Sanskrit newspapers and magazines - as I mentioned a few weeks ago - time allowing.

Best,

Venetia
