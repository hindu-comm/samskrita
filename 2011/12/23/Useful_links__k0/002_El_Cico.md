\>  
\>Dear Friends  
\>I have been collecting hyperlinks in e-mails from group members who provide links to useful resources. I have been adding them to my “favourites” on my internet browser, but recently my computer crashed because of corruption of the hard drive and I have lost all these links. Has anyone else been collecting these links? Also it will be good to have them on the webpage somewhere and we can keep adding to these:

\>Not sure how many Christians are on this group – to them a very merry Xmas and to every else season’s greetings and a very happy new year.
