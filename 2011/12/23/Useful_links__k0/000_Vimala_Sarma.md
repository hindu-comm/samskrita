Dear Friends

I have been collecting hyperlinks in e-mails from group members who provide links to useful resources. I have been adding them to my “favourites” on my internet browser, but recently my computer crashed because of corruption of the hard drive and I have lost all these links. Has anyone else been collecting these links? Also it will be good to have them on the webpage somewhere and we can keep adding to these:

They relate to:



Sites which have collections of e-books in Sanskrit literature and their translations.

Sites on grammar including members’ blogs

Sites on blogs relating to various topics including news and short stories and anecdotes.

Sites which have Sanskrit poetry and literature

Sites about shubhasitas, etc

Sites which have commentaries of important religious texts

Sites for dictionaries

Sites for transliteration tools and fonts

Sites which has audio of Sanskrit conversations, vedic chanting, meters etc,

Sites with DVDs

And other resources ( I am sure other members can add to the list).



Maybe this list can be a start and anyone who has given a link please post their links again on the website.



Not sure how many Christians are on this group – to them a very merry Xmas and to every else season’s greetings and a very happy new year.



Vimala
