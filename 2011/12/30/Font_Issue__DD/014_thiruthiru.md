Definitely it will be useful to those publishing religious journals.  
Most of the journals are run by individuals who do it as service only  
and as such they are unable to purchase any software and they simply  
depend upon freewares like NHM Writer. In NHM writer there is settings  
for writing Shree lipi Tamil which is widely used in printing books.  
But as far as Sanskrit is concerned they offer onlu unicode. and  
Unicode is not accepted by pagemaker used for printing. Hence if there  
is a way wither to directly type in shreelipi sanskrit with NHM writer  
or a with a unicode to shreelipi converter, they will be benefitted.
