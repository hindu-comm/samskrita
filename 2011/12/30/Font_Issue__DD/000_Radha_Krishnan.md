Dear Sir,

Namasthe all of you. Recently I downloaded one document from the net.  
It is in the font format DV-TTYogesh. I am unable to edit the same.  
Is there any editor which uses this font? or I prefer to convert the  
same into Unicode, so that I can make the changes. How to convert the  
same into Unicode?

TIA,  
RK
