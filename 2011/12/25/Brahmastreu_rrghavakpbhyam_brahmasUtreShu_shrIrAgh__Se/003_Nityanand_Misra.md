Narendra Ji,  
  
If you lookup the Random House English Dictionary (for American English) and the Collins English Dictionary (for British English), Namaste is listed as a noun and an interjection. Used as a noun, one can "*hold hands together in *a Namaste**" as one can "*give *a warm Hello**", and used as an interjection, one can wish "*Namaste \[to\] all*" as one wishes "*Hello \[to\] all*". Even in Hindi (from where English borrows the term as per the Online Etymology Dictionary), the term is used as a a noun (e.g. नमस्ते करना) and interjection (as the equivalent of Hello/Good morning/Bye). It is the interjection usage which I intended.  
  
What you said about "Namaste" in true only in Sanskrit, where it is a complete sentence in itself.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
