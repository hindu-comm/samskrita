Ram ram.

  

It can be used to in respect of all of you. "जातावेकवचनम्।’ as idiomatic usage of collective noun which can override all the grammatical rules of agreement of number in Sanskrit. "namste to all" is after all a Sanglish sentence, and there is no point in discussing about Sanskrit language applicable to Sanskrit sentences and words inflected.
