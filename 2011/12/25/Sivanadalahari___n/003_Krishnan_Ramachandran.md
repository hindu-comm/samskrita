Dear Sri Ramakrishna,



Thank you for giving a wonderful site for several important slokas. I for one have been looking for sivanandalahari. I will try to use it to chant daily. I have learnt 'soundaryalahari' to chant by following the same method suggested by you.



pranams and thanks



krishnan
