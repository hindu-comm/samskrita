Dear All,  
  
  
I was looking for a Sanskrit word for "fit to be seen". I got it from Apte's dictionary as दर्शनीयं . But my doubt is that दर्शनीयं could also mean "fit to be shown", when one add अनीयर प्रत्यय to दर्शयति , which is the प्रेरणार्थक क्रिया of the root दृश्। So how does one distinguish between the two. Is it depending on the context it is used?
