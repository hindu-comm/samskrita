Yes. Copy the attached file to where BhashaIME716.exe is located. Restart the IME. You will see a new entry under Transliterate2 for Sanskrit 98 -> Uni Devanagari. The converted text will be Unicode, which you can convert to any font of your liking (Siddhanta/Sanskrit 2003)  
  
NB. I do not have texts prepared with Sanskrit98 font; could not test the conversion tables. Pl. report any errors, which I shall correct.

Venkatesh
