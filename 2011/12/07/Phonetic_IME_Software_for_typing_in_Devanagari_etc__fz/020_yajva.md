Sri Bhat,  
  
I tried attaching the IME here, but google reponded saying the message is deleted. Apparently Google does not allow .7z files to be attached. So I have uploaded the file to the Google drive. Here's the download link  
  
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4uo7Dp5rwXSZDJmbndvZ2ZPWFU/edit?usp=sharing>  
  
Pl download, unzip, start the new IME. You will be able able to see "Sanskrit 98 -> Uni Dev" under "Transliterate2" menu. (not Sanskrit1998).  
  
Regards  
Venkatesh
