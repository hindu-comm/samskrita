As you may know,Sanskrit 98is used by the ITranslator software.

AnASCII textsource file with the .itx extension was provided as input and legacy font Devanagari(Sanskrit 1998) as output.

The current incarnation -iTranslator 2003 accepts the self-same ASCII text file as input, but generates Unicode output in user selected font.

  

So, you could track down the originaldocument, (probably with same name but with an .itx extension)...

  

These files can then be directly viewed in Devanagari or Roman international transliteration using [*Itranslator for PC with version 98, 99, 2003*](http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html)of[*Itrans*](http://www.aczoom.com/index.html).

I have just given it a try, and it works fine.

  

Taff,

 One time iTranslator beta tester for the reverse translation(Devanagari to Itrans/Roman transliteration) version of version 2003
