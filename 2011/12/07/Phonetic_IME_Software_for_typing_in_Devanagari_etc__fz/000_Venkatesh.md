Dear friends,  
  
I have tried to develop a software for typing Devanagari, e-Grantha (including Vedic accents for both), Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and roman/IAST scripts. The IME is phonetic ie. you type devanaagarii to get देवनागरी and shriimaan veGkaTanaathaaryaH to get श्रीमान् वेङ्कटनाथार्यः।  
  
Besides, the IME also supports transcripting Unicode-to-Unicode and Non-Unicode-to-Unicode.  
  
The platform is Windows.  
  
More details available in the User's reference manual.  
  
To download, go to the following links->goto "File" menu->click "Download"  
  
The software is free for all purposes.  
  
Kindly send your feedback to [bhas...@gmail.com]()
