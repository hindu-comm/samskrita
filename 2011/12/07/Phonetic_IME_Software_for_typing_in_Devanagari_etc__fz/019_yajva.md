Sri Bhat  
  
I have attached entire package. Pl download attached .7z file and unzip. Start the IME. Under "Transliterate2" menu, you will have "Sanskrit 98 -> Uni Dev" (not Sanskrit1998). Copy the text to be converted to clipboard, invoke "Sanskrit 98 -> Uni Dev", wait for completion and paste to the target editor.  
  
Regards  
Venkatesh
