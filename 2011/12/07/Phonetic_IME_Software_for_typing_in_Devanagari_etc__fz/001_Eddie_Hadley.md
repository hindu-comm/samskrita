Venkat and all,

Splendid work with the IME.

And it does indeed work in Windows 7.

Now, speaking as one of the many Devanagari challenged Westerners, not to mention keyboard challenged one finger typist ones, the ideal Western user friendly system for editing Sanskrit, would display the Devanagari only as the end product.

I envisage a two frame window, similar to the still useful *Itranslator*, but without the onscreen English graffiti.

The user types happily away in graffiti speak as usual, but the screen shows Romanised diacritics.

Editing being done directly with the Romanised text.

Meanwhile, the Devanagari script, (on view or not, as desired) magically arises above, squiggle by squiggle, ligatures and all.



My finger(s) types saMskR^ita

my eyes see **saṁskṛta**

and the wizard conjures up **संस्कृत**

All while I am directly editing ***saṁskṛta*.**



There are no shortage of available apps., online or offline, that do the business, but in their confusing graffiti languages.

They were essential in the pre-Unicode era, but surely we are long overdue for some post ASCII sophistication.

Anglicised capitals included, so to give **Saṁskṛta** while retaining **संस्कृत****.**



Eddie
