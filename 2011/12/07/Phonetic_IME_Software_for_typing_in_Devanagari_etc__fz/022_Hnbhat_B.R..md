I had downloaded the file from the link. But could not see the menu either Sanskrit 98 or 1998.

  

The Gmail doesn't allow attachments of executable files as their policy either in zipped or as attachments files.

  

No problem. I downloaded the one provided by Anunada Simha and converted the text successfully.

  

Thanks for your efforts. I will download this new pack too and check.
