The updated ver (716) is already available. Download from the BhashaIME site, unzip the .7z file. (You will find a bunch of T\_\*.txt files which are the conversion rules). The IME has Transliterate1 and Transliterate2 Menus, under which you will find a number of non-unicode to Unicode selections.  
  
Pl remember that converions from non-uni to uni is not a generic one, but specific to each non-uni font. I have included conversions for those which I have come across or have been requested for. If you cannot find what you need here, let me know. I can probably write a converter for it.
