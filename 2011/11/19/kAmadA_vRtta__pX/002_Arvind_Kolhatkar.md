Kamaleshji,

Are you referring to वृत्तरत्नाकर by केदारभट्ट? I have it but it does  
not even mention कामदा. I have an excellent book in Hindi called  
छन्दप्रभाकर and a couple of Marathi books. छन्दप्रभाकर has examples  
but they are in Hindi. Again the Marathi books that I have do not  
mention कामदा, though I know several Marathi verses in it. I am  
trying to lay my hands on a Sanskrit illustration and am finding that  
to be surprisingly difficult.
