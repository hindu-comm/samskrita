Thanks Sundar,

I have downloaded it and find it to be the best book on this subject,  
even better than old authors like Kedarabhatta. It is very detailed  
and explains everything extensively. What is more, being a product of  
the recent days, it also connects with prosody of modern times. It  
is, however, in Marathi and hence, not widely accessible to all.
