*\>\>"As for the question on Murthy'*  

  

Dr. Bhat mistakenly attributed the question to Shri Murthy. The question had been raised by ShriShreevatsa.

\>\>But I have a further question: why "तस्मिन् काये"? I remember reading thatबिभेति was usually used withपञ्चमी -- so it should have been "तस्मात् कायात्"? Why isसप्तमीused here, as "तस्मिन् काये"?

  

Irrespective of the questioner, the answer holds good.
