I could not find such entry in MW as bhibhyati

as singular and there is no such entry too:

  

<http://acharya.iitm.ac.in/cgi-bin/dictionary/search.cgi?word=bhI&exact=yes>

  

If it is found there, it is grammatically wrong according to Paninian derivation and you may please find the process to support your form. Here is the Paninian process of derivation:

  

जुहोत्यादिभ्यः श्लुः। बहुषु बहुवचनम्

  

१. भी+\[श्लु\]+झि

"7-1-4 अदभ्यस्तात्‌ ।" झस्य अद्,

२.भी+श्लु+अत्+इ \> अति

भी+\[श्लु\]+अति

6-1-10 श्लौ । द्वित्वम्।

३.भी+भी+\[श्लु\]+अति

7-4-59 ह्रस्वः । अभ्यासस्य भी- इत्यस्य ह्रस्वः।

४.भी+भी+\[श्लु\]+अति

8-4-54 अभ्यासे चर्च्च । इति भकारस्य बकारः

५. बि+भी+\[श्लु\]+अति।

6-4-82 एरनेकाचोऽसंयोगपूर्वस्य इति यण्, (अनेकाचोऽङ्गस्य)

६. बि+भी+अति। श्लु - zero morpheme. but warranting duplication as १ above.

बिभ्+य् +अति \> बिभ्यति।

  

  

This is the proper conjugation according to Paninian system. If you found otherwise, it is wrong. I didn't find in my MW dictionary. Once this is fixed as plural, the corresponding subject also should be in plural, and never in singular which makes भार्याः in the plural and not in singular.

  

As for the question on Murthy, गतवति वायौ प्राणापाये तस्मिन् काये is to be taken as सति सप्तमी, than related adverbial clause of time. "यस्य च भावेन भावलक्षणम्" and than being related to बिभ्यति. When life is gone from the body (or the body is without life), even wives are afraid of it. This is in contrast with so far the body is capable of earning, everybody take care of. and now even wives are afraid of it.
