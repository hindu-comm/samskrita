In the Ramayana quotation also it is not भी that is not used in locative, but only the word भय is used in singular locative. The other is proper plural usage: भये (सति), सर्वे हि बिभ्यति. All would be afraid in case of any sign of frightening. (भय is translated as भयनिमित्त)

  

And बिभ्यति could be conjugated as verbal form in the present tense as I person plural only according to Panini as already explained in my earlier post. And it can be locative of the present participle, बिभ्यत् derived from the same verb. In the Ramayana quotation, the commentators seem explain it as conjugated form of the verb.
