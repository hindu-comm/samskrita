Yes. This is the next rule applicable in the case of re-duplicated verbs called अभ्यस्त. There are still more that over rul

  

The next two rules with jh in the Atmanepada verbs, ending in vowels other than short "a" and शी, and विद् used as आत्मनेपद.

  

the duplicated parts together called as अभ्यस्त, as in the present case while first is called अभ्यास. (See 6.1.4-6).
