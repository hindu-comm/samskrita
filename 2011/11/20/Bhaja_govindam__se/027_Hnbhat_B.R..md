I had seen this entry and I think you failed to notice the usage as epic and not general classical literature. Which are considered as archaic according to Paninian standard आर्ष. As per Paninian Grammar, it can be explained as plural form itself and there is no such other verb that can be conjugated like this. In other words they are irregular forms, if not ungrammatical. 

  

Thanks for bringing the whole result of search.
