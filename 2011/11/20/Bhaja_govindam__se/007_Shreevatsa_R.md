No, for two reasons:

  

\* "bibhyanti" would not fit the metre (the metre of this group of verses has been recently discussed on this group, see thread titled "Meter of चर्पटपञ्जरिकास्तोत्र").

\*"bibhyanti" is not the grammatical form. The plural form is "bibhyati" as in the verse; the verb is conjugated as "bibheti 
bibhītaḥ bibhyati..." (बिभेति बिभीतः बिभ्यति). See<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktconjug?q=bhii;c=3;font=deva>

  

As for the original question, I also can only think of the visarga explanation -- "भार्या बिभ्यति" is from sandhi of "भार्याः + बिभ्यति". Besides the polygamy explanation, one could also read "भार्याः" more literally as "dependents" instead of "wives".

(MW dictionary gives "m. one supported by or dependent on another , a servant".)

  

But I have a further question: why "तस्मिन् काये"? I remember reading thatबिभेति was usually used withपञ्चमी -- so it should have been "तस्मात् कायात्"? Why isसप्तमीused here, as "तस्मिन् काये"?

  

Thanks,

Shreevatsa
