Bhat Ji,  
  
I did not say भी is used **in** the locative in the Ramayana verse, but **with** the locative \[ie with भये, which is locative form of भय\]. But you are right, with the the शतृ suffix the form is बिभ्यत्, which in the locative would be बिभ्यति. An example occurs in the Srimadbhagavata 9.24.36  
  
तं सात्यजन्नदीतोये कृच्छ्राल्लोकस्य **बिभ्यती**
