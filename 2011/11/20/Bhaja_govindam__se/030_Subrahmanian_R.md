नमस्ते।

Today I chanced to see an anthology of speeches etc of the Sage of Kanchi, Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi. The book quotes a पाठभेद - भार्या त्रस्यति तस्मिन् काये - and the Sage of Kanchi explains that this rendering is better because बिभ्यति conveys 'fear' and त्रस्यति connotes 'fear mixed with disgust'. I do not know which case the root of त्रस्यति governs. Scholar members can say better about this.

Obeisance to the sadhas
