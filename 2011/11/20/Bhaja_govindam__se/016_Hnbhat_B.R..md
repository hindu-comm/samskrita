तस्मिन् काये वायौ गतवति - In body, when the life air is gone, all are afraid of it.

  

I am sorry I have mistaken the questioner. But the explanation is the same. सति सप्तमी is popular usage. तस्मिन् काये यदा वायुः गतवान्, तदा, इत्यर्थः।

And विवक्षातः कारकाणि भवन्ति, when the भयहेतु is not intended in the context verbally, no need to take पञ्चमी due to अपादान on account of it.
