कस्य बिभ्यति देवाश्च जातरोषस्य संयुगे॥

  

There are two possible solutions for the absence of पञ्चमी।

  

१. जातरोषस्य कस्य संयुगे देवाश्च बिभ्यति -

  

When he is angry, in whose battle even the gods are afraid of (to face him).

Here कस्य is not related as the cause of fear, भयहेतु, and as a relative to संयुग, the battle. Hence it takes शेषे षष्ठी. The gods are frightened to see him in the battle, when he is angry. They are not enemies, but only his valor is glorified as frightening even his admirers.

  

2. Second solution is, the even the gods are afraid of him, in the battle field, when he is angry. Here it is evaded by the use of the maxim, "संज्ञापूर्वको विधिरनित्यः" as the पञ्चमी is prescribed making use of the अपादानसंञा, it is optional. Hence शेषे षष्ठी again, just relation of frightening and not the अपादान.

  

This is the explanation of Govindaraja. कस्येति संबन्धसामान्ये षष्ठी, कस्मात् बिभ्यतीत्येवार्थः।



जातरोषस्य कृपया शिक्षार्थं स्वीकृतकोपाभासस्य कस्य संयुगे सङ्ग्रामे देवा: चकारादन्येऽप्यसुरादयो बिभ्यति- भयं प्राप्नुवन्तीत्यर्थ:। कस्य संयुगे इत्यन्वयान्न किंशब्दाद्भीत्रार्थानामित्यपादानमूलकपञ्चमीप्रसक्ति:। कस्य बिभ्यतीत्यन्वये तु अपादानत्वाविवक्षया तदप्रसक्ति: सम्बन्धसामान्यविवक्षया च षष्ठी ।।

  

शिरोमणिव्याख्या।
