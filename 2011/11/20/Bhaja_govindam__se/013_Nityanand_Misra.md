भी is also used with the locative, e.g. in the Ramayana, Valmiki uses it thus (४.८.३५)  
  
शङ्कया त्वेतया चाहं दृष्ट्वा तवामपि राघव  
नोपसर्पाम्यहं भीतो **भये सर्वे हि बिभ्यति  
  
**Also Satyajit Ji pointed out that बिभ्यति could be singular also as ME mentions it, however most examples I came across on the Internet were in the plural - the form occurs five times in Srimadbhagavata and on all occasions it is in the plural as can be seen here - <http://vedabase.net/b/bibhyati>
