Just taking clue from MW as ep. usages which was quoted by Sathyajit, made a search, but could not find any in DGCS. But the following instances can easily be confused as singular usages. And no instances of "bibhyanti" in any of the texts available in the corpus.  

  

In this case also it can be confused with singular:

  

Rām, Utt, 6, 36.2  
asmākaṃ pramukhe sthātuṃ sarva eva hi**bibhyati**//

  

  

which can be spit as sarve eva or sarva eva.

  

-   MBh, 12, 21, 4.1  
    na bibheti yadā cāyaṃ yadā cāsmānna**bibhyati**/  
    [Context](http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=313371) -   MBh, 12, 21, 4.1  
    na**bibheti**yadā cāyaṃ yadā cāsmānna bibhyati /

Here because of the proximity of ayaṃ in singular which can be easily be confused with singular usage archaic.

  

Here also like here in the verse:

  

Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha, 3, 74.1  
sāvadat pālitā yena prajāḥ sarvā na**bibhyati**/

  

In any case, if found, they are to be considered as archaic, or could be any other form of verbal participle bibhyat in three genders. bibhyati - loc.singular. bibhanti - neuter gender plural. in feminine, nominative would be bibhyatI.
