*"As for the question on Murthy, गतवति वायौ प्राणापाये तस्मिन् काये is to be taken as सति सप्तमी, than related adverbial clause of time. "यस्य च भावेन भावलक्षणम्" and than being related to बिभ्यति. When life is gone from the body (or the body is without life), even wives are afraid of it. This is in contrast with so far the body is capable of earning, everybody take care of. and now even wives are afraid of it."*

I am afraid I am unable to understand what the learned member wants to convey.

Regards

Murthy
