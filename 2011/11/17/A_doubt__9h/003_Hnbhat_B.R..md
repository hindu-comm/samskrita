The difference is clear in the names in the question itself.

एकशेष is a वृत्ति one of the five, वृत्ति-s, कृद्वृत्तिः, तद्धितवृत्तिः, समासवृत्तिः, सनाद्यन्तवृत्तिः and एकशेष-वृत्तिः.

which is a grammatical function of assimilation of similar and dissimilar forms of words. And it can be seen from the list, द्वन्द्व is coming under the समास-वृत्तिः like other वृत्ति-s. Now the question is clear to some extent, what is the difference between वृत्ति and द्वन्द्व which is a समास included in the group of वृत्ति-s. The function is prescribed in the Sutra-s from[१।२।](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/1.2.72.htm)६५to[१।२।७३](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/1.2.73)

  

Even in रामौ it is एकशेष function. Ajit is right in considering पितरौ as variety of द्वन्द्व as एकशेष function is available as the word in द्विवचन itself explains the द्वन्द्व माता च पिता च, which is the function of वृत्ति, and एकशेष is the function. Even if it were, the two fathers पितरौ the two fathers of Rama and Krishna, there won't be a द्वन्द्व compound, but only द्विवचन of the word पितॄ like रामौ.
Precisely this is the difference.

  

For the parents, पितरौ is एकशेष, while मातापितरौ and मातरपितरौ are optional द्वन्द्व compounds. This depends on the meaning whether there is a compound or not, but the function is एकशेष as a वृत्ति, like द्वन्द्व is a variety of समासवृत्ति.

  

There are many other examples governed by the above rules and many have only idiomatic usage like पितरौ when meaning both parents.
