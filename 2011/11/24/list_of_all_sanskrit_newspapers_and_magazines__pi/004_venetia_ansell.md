Thanks everyone. I will let the group know as and when I manage to do this. In the meantime, Nandu at Sanskrit documents has added the list from Sragdhara to a section on Sanskrit newspapers and periodicals on their site - please have a look here: <http://sanskritdocuments.org/sanskritfaq.html#SECTION0003400>  
(Search for "Additionally, there are newspapers and magazines in Sanskrit published daily/fortnightly/monthly/quarterly or less frequent. ")
