Bundi (Rajasthan), Nov 22 (PTI) Residents of a small town in Rajasthan use  
Sanskrit in daily communication to keep the ancient language alive.  
Whenever they meet, residents of Kaperan town, about 80 km from here, greet  
one another with 'namo nameh'. Bharti, a girl from the town, says,  
"Sanskrit is a sweet language and I love to speak it as much as I can."  
Kaperan is considered to be the stronghold of Sanskrit language in the  
desert state and about 25 families, irrespective of their social and  
economic status, are trying to keep the language alive by using it in daily  
communication. Sohan, an 8th class student, says, "Sanskrit is our cultural  
language and it is up to young generation to revive it." Rajendra Sharma of  
New Delhi-based National Sanskrit Sansthan, presently deputed at Udaipur,  
said, "We intend to convert Rajasthan to a Sanskrit-speaking state. We keep  
organising Sanskrit language camps in the state." Pankaj Gautam, a lecturer  
at Sankalan Degree College in the town, says Khada town in Banswara  
district is another area where Sanskrit is used for daily communication.
