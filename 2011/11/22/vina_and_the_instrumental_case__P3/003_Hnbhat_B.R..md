These are not the only words pre-requirement of तृतीया vibhakti. There are many others. Instrumental case properly translated from कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया, in respect of the करण = Instrument of any action, sense the use of this vibhakti generally and in passive voice, it is used in respect of the agent of the action. All the others are extended usages. The case government, in collocation with other words, is called उपपदविभक्ति and the in contrast with the regular विभक्ति called कारकविभक्ति.

7. पृथग्विनानानाभिस्तृतीयान्यतरस्याम् (द्वितीया, पञ्चमी) (पा०2.3.32)

  

As you can see the word विना can take द्वितीया and पञ्चमी also in addition to तृतीया। This accounts for the Accusative in the above example and in the first example.

But not with any synonyms of it or any other words.That is how उपपदविभक्ति works, unless otherwise prescribed. So विरह though means विनाभाव, it is not covered by this rule and there is no place for doubt. and अनायास though means the same, absence of आयास or विना आयासं as you would expect or विनायासेन. like the first two examples.On the other hand, "सहयुक्तेऽप्रधाने" warrants it with its synonymous usages too and even without "saha" also, which is the case of अनायासेन (सह) मरणम्.

विरह is not included among the words demanding तृतीयाविभक्ति and also in your question you have separated the word विरह from the compound which is not normally done without splitting the compound formally. In other words it is wrong to split ungrammatically and get yourself puzzled. As Arvindji had already pointed out, there is no case for तृतीया because of the word विरह, as it is part of the compound qualifying the शाप and doesn't have independent syntactic value. Even if it is independent, it doesn't warrant तृतीयाविभक्ति like विना which is specially listed among others governing it.
