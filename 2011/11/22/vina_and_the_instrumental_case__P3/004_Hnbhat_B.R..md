Just reading the headline, from the incoming message, I was late to realize the content of this message. "Vina and the Instrumental" - I though it might have been related with something in musical instruments! Better the use of Sanskrit words and Devanagari script to attract attention immediately in the messages relating to Grammar of Sanskrit particularly.
