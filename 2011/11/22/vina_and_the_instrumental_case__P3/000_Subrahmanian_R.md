I understand that the words \[सह\] with and \[विना\] without govern the \[तृतीया विभक्ति\] instrumental case.



I am puzzled by the following two instances:

अनायासेन मरणम्, विना दैन्येन जीवनम् ।

देहि मे कृपया कृष्ण, शरणागत वत्सल ॥



why the instrumental case for 'anaayaasam'?



विना वेंकटेशं न नाथो न नाथ:

सदा वेंकटेशं स्मरामि स्मरामि ॥

Why accusative case is used instead of instrumental?



Possibly, the word has different connotations: (1) without (2) except or other than

It cannot be 'without Venkatesa', it has to be 'other than or except Venkatesa, who \[else\] is the saviour - none'

Is it that instrumental case is mandatory only when it is used in the sense of 'without'.



On this subject, I am also reminded of 'कश्चित् कान्ता विरह गुरुणा . . ’ wherein viraha with similar meaning of vina has caused the instrumental case.
