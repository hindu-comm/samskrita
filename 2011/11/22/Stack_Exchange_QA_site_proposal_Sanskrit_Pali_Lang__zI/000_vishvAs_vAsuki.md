Hi!  
  
1. Personal message: Anyone who has ever programmed for a significant time knows about the usefulness of stackexchange in getting questions answered reliably (and without nonsense) by a community of users. Please join and "follow" it so that we may one day have a stackexchange for sanskrit and pali; and please forward this request to interested contacts. I often have the urge to ask Sanskrit questions, so such a site would definitely help those like me.  
  
2. Generic message:  
  
I'm supporting a proposal to create a new Q&A website for Sanskrit & Pali scholars, Indologists, and linguists interested in Indic languages and texts.  
  
It's built on the same software as [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com), a hugely popular site where over seven million programmers help each other with difficult programming problems. On Stack Overflow the audience votes for the best answer, so the answer you want is usually right at the top, not on page five.  
  
I'm hoping that a site for Sanskrit & Pali scholars, Indologists, and linguists interested in Indic languages and texts would have the same kind of network effect and turn into an amazing resource.  
  
The proposal process is going on here:

Thanks!
