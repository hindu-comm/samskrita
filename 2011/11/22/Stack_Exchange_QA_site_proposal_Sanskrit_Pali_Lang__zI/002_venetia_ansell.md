This is a great idea.



There is a FAQ site for the Indology email group (<http://faq.indology.info/wiki/Main_Page>), which has a lot of (mainly Western) indologists on it, but I don't think it's been used or populated much so far.  

Maybe in time these two initiatives could be merged to be of maximum use to maximum people.
