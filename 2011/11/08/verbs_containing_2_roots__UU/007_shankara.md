Murthyji,

  

Thanks for your kind reply.  

  

As far as I know, the usage of compound verb is very frequent in Malayalam and Tamil (I do not know about Telugu and Kannada) as well as in Hindi. This is not found so much in Sanskrit as mentioned in Dr Bhatji's mail. Your examples "चोरयामास, ईक्षांचक्रे" are either auxiliary verb or N+V Compound verb as explained in [Wikipedia article on compound verbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_verb). I was actually looking for V+V compound verbs in Sanskrit.  



regards  
shankara
