Just I was reading Nareshji's reply and looked for the compound verbs and found this explanation:

  

<http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/compoundverb.htm>

  

and

  

<http://spanish.about.com/cs/verbs/g/compoundgl.htm>

  

In the first, it is the case of Sanskrit suffix having a single subject performing more than one actions and also infinite verbs like गन्तुमिच्छति, गत्वा पठति. Vickipedia gives examples from Hindi, and they are idiomatic usages in the respective languages.

  

Even in निकल् गया can be two verbs, निकला, गया

which is translated as went out. which is in English a prepositional verb. But in Sanskrit, it is not so used with many verbs but only the many independent actions of the .agent. I don't remember any such auxiliary verbs or complex predicates in Sanskrit as explained in the Vikipage:

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)>

  



The ones cited by Abhyankar is only normal usages of multiple actions denoted by the verbs and do not contribute to a main verb as expected in the case of complex predicates or compound verbs. In English, there is no change in the form as complex sentences can take as many clauses like our Sanskrit Compounds can be consisting of as many as words in a single sentence. In compound sentences, they are independent sentences joined by conjuncts and carry multiple verbs.



This much I can say about Sanskrit. More can be explored by the interested members.
