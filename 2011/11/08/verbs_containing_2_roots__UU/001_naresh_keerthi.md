Hi,  
  
In linguistics, such constructions are called Compound Verbs (CVs), and fall into the larger family of 'Complex Predicates'.  
  
Common observations about Cvs are that the First verb term V1 usually carries the semantic content of the action, while the V2 has a syntactic, or intensifying or qualifying role.  
  
The verb forms like the lyabantas, ktvantas and sentences using shatR and shAnac could fall into this category.  
  
In India, Anvita Abbi of new Delhi and Samiksha Bajpai from bangalore are working on CVs in IndiaN LANGUAGES.  
  
  
Regards,  
Naresh
