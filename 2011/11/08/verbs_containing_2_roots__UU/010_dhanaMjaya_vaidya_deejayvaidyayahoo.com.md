The most routine verb compounding in संस्कृत is for the non-witnessed  
past (परोक्ष = लिट्). The semantic content and the argument structure  
(i.e., what कारकs are obligatory or allowed in the sentence) is  
carried by one verbal root ending in "आम्", while the tense, person  
and number markings are carried by the auxiliary (अनुप्रयोग) verbal  
root. कृ, भू, अस् are the allowed auxiliary roots for these  
construction.

e.g.,  
गोपायाञ् चकार (He/she/it guarded/kept hidden, \[in the past and  
unwitnessed by the speaker\])

It is important to note that "गोपायाञ्/गोपायाम्" is not a participle,  
i.e., not a कृदन्त. It has all of the characteristics of a finite  
verb, i.e., तिङन्त. It will be unaccented (except for exceptional  
circumstances) if it followed another word that is not a finite verb  
in a sentence. Being a finite verb, its direct object necessarily has  
to be in the second case (द्वितीया) , there is no optional sixth case  
(षष्ठी) usage as can be done with कृदन्त...

As for the example given by respected list member shankara :  
चला गया (calā gayā), etc.

A better example (if the intention is to be parallel to the malayALam  
and tamizh examples would be खा चुका (has \[already\] eaten/is done  
eating).

Such constructions also exist in मराठी, e.g., खाऊन टाकले. It is a  
matter of controversy among मराठी grammarians if the semantic  
component is a finite verb or it is a verbal construction that is now  
a noun/adverb etc.  
For the purpose of this discussion, if these are to be considered  
"verbs with two roots" such usage is available in संस्कृत. e.g.,  
कर्तुं व्रजति, कृत्वा तिष्ठति, etc. In these cases, there is only one  
finite verb-form, all others are participles or verbal constructions  
that are infinitives/adverbials etc.

Let us look at one of the hindI examples above in detail :

  
दिया गया (diyā gayā)  

Let us complete the sentence to look at the role of "दिया" in  
organizing the sentence.  
As a finite verb in the past tense "देना", in a complete sentence  
there is expectation of  
(a) an agent, obligatorily with the -ने termination,  
(b) a recipient, obligatorily with the -को termination  
(c) a direct object, obligatorily without case termination (first  
case)  
स्त्रीने बैलोंको घास दिया ।  
However note the following:  
(स्त्रीसे) (बैलोंको) घास दिया गया ।  
Both the agent and the recipient are optional, the termination of the  
agent is not what "देना" dictates. "गया" dictates the component  
structure of the sentence. (However this is a matter of controversy.)

In any case, second (auxiliary-like with partial/modal meaning) verbs  
of this kind in संस्कृत are:  
For simplicity the first verb भोक्तुम् has been used for all example.  
But any verb may be used in these "compound verbs: (from पाणिनिसूत्र  
३.४.६५-६६)  
भोक्तुं शक्नोति  
भोक्तुं धृष्णोति  
भोक्तुं जानाति  
भोक्तुं ग्लायति  
भोक्तुं घटते  
भोक्तुम् आरभते  
भोक्तुं लभते  
भोक्तुं प्रक्रमते  
भोक्तुं सहते/उत्सहते  
भोक्तुम् अर्हति  
भोक्तुं भवति/अस्ति/विद्यते  
भोक्तुं पारयति
