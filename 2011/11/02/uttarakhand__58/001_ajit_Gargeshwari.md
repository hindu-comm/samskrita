Dear Ramakrishnan,  
  
Sorry if i sound a bit different Proper names is left to prerogative of the person who names i can spell my name as ajit or ajith or aajit its my decision right. The people of a state can decide what name they want to keep their state name as they nether require a grammatical or etymological proofs for the origin of the name. Grammar evolves out of usage and Grammar does not dictate usage it only tries to regulate usage so that everyone do have a common ground for communication. If a usage is ungrammatical and is used by a large section of people then the usage dominates not Grammar.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
