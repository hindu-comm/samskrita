"

FYI, I am about to go to press with my new book "Croaking Frogs",  
\>\> which is a workbook for learning Sanskrit metrics and figures of  
\>\> speech. If you would like to see a review copy let me know, and give  
\>\> me a snail mail mailing address. It will be available by the end of  
\>\> the year and is targeted at Sanskrit students who are interested in  
\>\> prosody. If you have any suggestions on who is working on prosody and  
\>\> metrics issues that might be worth contacting about this, I would be  
\>\> grateful for any suggestions, particularly people who may want to  
\>\> write a review or consider it for addition to academic reading lists.
