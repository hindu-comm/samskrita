We had a discussion about Uttarakhand on indo-eurasia mailing list. I am reproducing part my replies to that thread on that list.  
  
Email 1 -  
Two Panini sutras are relevant here: dakShiNaadaach (5.3.36 ) and  
uttaraachcha (5.3.38). These explain the words uttaraa and dakShiNaa  
with the 'aach' suffix. Straightforward application of the sutras, no  
clever reasoning required.  
  
And dictionaries list both uttara and uttaraa. (e.g., uttaraapatha -  
just as dakShiNaapatha).  
  
\[In response to further explanation there were two emails. \]  
  
Email 2 - \[Michael Witzel's email - he gave justification using Pre-Paninian forms here.\]  
You can read the message here:

Email 3 - \[ Copy/pasting my reply which was written as explanation. \]  
  
  
5.3.36/38 need terms from some additional sutras for explanation:  
  
(a) astaati (defined in 5.3.27) is an affix seen after direction words  
in the sense of saptamI (e.g., lives "in"), panchamI (i.e., "comes  
from") and prathamA (nominative), and referring to direction, place or  
time.  
This was abbreviated as adverb, etc. in Michael's email.  
  
(b) From 5.3.35, the panchamI sense is retired. ( ... apanchamyAH)  
leaving saptamI and prathamA.  
  
Now in 5.3.36/38, we are only concerned with two words dakShiNa and  
uttara and not all direction words. The "aach" implies that these two  
words are also seen with elongation, i.e., as dakShiNaa and uttaraa.  
Also, (a) and (b) give the sense in which the two words occur --  
saptamI or prathamA (but not panchami). Patanjali in his Mahabhashya  
wrestles with the "ch" part of the sutra and gives a justification,  
which is tangential to our discussion. So we can let that be.  
  
So based on this sutra etc., the later grammarians like those of  
Kashika give examples of uttarA and dakShiNA used in sense of saptamI  
or prathamA but not panchamI. Hence, e.g., dakShiNA vasati, "lives in  
the south", uttarA ramaNIyam, "the north is beautiful". Some examples  
are repeated in later texts like Siddhanta Kaumudi.  
  
So much for uttarA (or dakShiNA).  
  
Now to close the loop as it relates to uttarAkhaNDa. Here we see a  
compound word of the two words uttarA and khaNDa. I am guessing that  
this compound can be explained using a karmadhAraya type of samAsa  
(compounding). uttarA (taken in the sense of prathamA) khaNDaH,  
"northern part".  
  
I am avoiding the sense saptamI sense of uttarA ("in north") because  
that type of samAsa is used sparingly and with only certain words.  
Hence explaining it as "northern part" instead of "in north part".
