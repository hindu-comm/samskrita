namo namaH,  
  
Do you know of any comprehensive resources on the Net that catalog samskrit texts covering various shaastras available so far?  
  
Where do I start the search? There is a nice index of vedic literature in Mahesh Yogi's  
Maharishi University of Management ([mum.edu](http://mum.edu)) website.  
<http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/>  
  
Looking for a similar resource covering other areas of science.  
I know I am asking a too vague and broad-based question, but any pointers will be appreciated.  
- Sai.
