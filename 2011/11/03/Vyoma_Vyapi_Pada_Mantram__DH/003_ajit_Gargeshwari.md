They are a part of Kamika Agama ,as per my knowledge it forms a part of Shiavagama. I think a complete Sanskrit text of the said Agama is lost. Manuscripts of the said text are known to exist probably at [Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient (French School of Asian Studies).](http://www.efeo.fr/presentation/pondi.shtml)  
  
M00125 and M00124 are available for download at <http://www.muktabodha.org>  
Probably you can dowload the text and serach for Sanskrit slokas that make this Vyoma  
Vyapi Pada Mantram.  
  
Scholars may correct me if i am wrong
