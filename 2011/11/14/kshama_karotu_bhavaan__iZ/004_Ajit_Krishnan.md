namaste,

\> How are constructions of the form hE bhavati possible?  
\> None of the sarvanAma pada-s (pronouns) take sambOdhana vibhakti.

  
Texts like Manu Smriti, Bodhayana Dharma Sutras (and many others)  
explain the bhikShA procedure. They state that bhikShA is to requested  
of a woman, and that the भवत् word is to be used. The commentaries  
explain this word form to be भवति. Now, a look at शब्दरूपावलिः or the  
like does not show any such word form.

We know that such a word form did exist in the past, and continues to  
be used today in the bhikShA context. The best explanation that I've  
come across is sambodhana. Perhaps this word form can be explained  
away as pre-Paninian vedic sanskrit (प्रयोगोऽयं आर्षः, छान्दसो वा,  
अपाणिनीयो वा), or perhaps there is some other explanation.

  
\> Also the usage of prathama puruSa for the bhavat forms is independent of the  
\> vibhakti/ vacana/ linga of the bhavat particle.

  
Sorry, but I don't understand what you are trying to say.

sasneham,

 ajit
