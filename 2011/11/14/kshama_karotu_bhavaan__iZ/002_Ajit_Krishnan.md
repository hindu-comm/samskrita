नमस्ते,

  
\> भवती भिक्षान् देहि,

  
There is a typo here which is the cause of the misunderstanding. The  
text is actually, हे भवति, (त्वं) भिक्षां देहि and has the same  
sentence construction as हे अन्नपूर्णे, (त्वं) भिक्षां देहि. In  
general, भवान् should not be considered a respectful form of त्वम्.  
Generably speaking, they can be used interchangeably (with  
corresponding changes in the verb form).

सस्नेहम्,

  
अजितः
