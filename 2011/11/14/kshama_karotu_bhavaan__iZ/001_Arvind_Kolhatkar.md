I am afraid I do not know the precise grammar behind it but the best  
places to find usages of भवान्, भवती (as also of अत्र/तत्रभवान्, अत्र/  
तत्रभवती) would be texts that have conversations in them, such as  
plays or prose texts like पञ्चतन्त्र. The latter has several  
instances of their use not only in the imperative but in all tenses.
