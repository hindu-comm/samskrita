Sorry. I could not follow the thread from the beginning.

  

As Naresh Keerthi has pointed out, generally personal pronouns do not take vocative usage. Exceptionally they can and hence it is only natural that the feminine form of the pronoun भवत् can be भवती and the corresponding vocative in the feminine form pronoun will be हे भवति declined in any case like any feminine word ending with vowel ई as नदी.

  

Naresh Kirthi probably wanted to say that the two words भवत् pronoun used in the first person is not to be confused with the participle of भू - भवत्. Both are declined similarly except in the nominative singular. The first will take the form भवान् while the second will take भवन्. Otherwise both take similar forms.

  

As for the usage, of bhavat, it is derived also from the root भा दीप्तौ (to shine) which justifies its usage in respect of respectful persons depending on the speakers and their relation with the addressed. In general whatever appears before you could be addressed as भवत् but it is used in respect of persons by usage as a pronoun. To address respectfully in dramatic language, it is used in collocation of अत्र and तत्र - भवान्, भवती which is common in drama-s while addressing respectful persons one speaks to. This has been generalized to the usage of भवत् alone also.

  

And according to Panini, his rules governs only language and not धर्मशास्त्र. Whether to ask भिक्षा from the housemaster or mistress is left to the writers on the subject and has nothing to do with the usage of the pronoun.



And as per ऊँ भवति भिक्षां देहि is treated as a "mantra" of माधुकरी वृत्ति i.e. collecting from begging from the householders (and particularly it is called so as one mendicant भिक्षु should not collect what he wants to put on from a house alone like the honeybee collects from each flower a little to store honey. This is the social norm of mendicant society and hence the sentence भवति भिक्षां देहि is treated as a "mantra" for the purpose and it has nothing to do with Grammar than that. As a grammatical sentence, it is not the verbal form, but vocative case of the pronoun of the proverb भवत् - in the feminine gender भवति and to explain, this the vocative interjection is added to it to complete the sense grammatically ; हे भवति, \[त्वं\] भिक्षां देहि।

as commented by the commentators. Or it is volitional to consider it as verb and relate withऊँ which is generally prefixed to any "mantra" as we do with सहस्रनामस्तोत्र into नामावली each name in dative used with this prefix.

  

Sorry for the lengthy reply.
