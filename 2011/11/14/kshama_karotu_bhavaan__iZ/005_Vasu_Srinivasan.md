Agree with Ajit mahodaya.  
  
Understanding of "bhavat" as a respect-form of "tvam" is most likely a recent phenomenon - influenced by praantIya bhaaShaa - (all south-indian, hindi etc have that difference).  
  
Bhagavad-gita (duryodhana addressing as both bhavaan and tvam), Ramayana (hanuman addressing Rama/Lakshmana as both bhavan and tvam) etc clearly shows there was no "respect" distinction perceived in these texts. It could have been very likely in the tone. Several more may be quoted.  
  
But, just like in south indian languages, plural form has been used for respect (bhavantaH when addressing a single person) especially to Swamiji-s etc. Not sure if this is the case in older sanskrit texts (say before 1000 CE) While the plural-respect-form is common in SI-languages, its probably not that common in Sanskrit, in my limited understanding.
