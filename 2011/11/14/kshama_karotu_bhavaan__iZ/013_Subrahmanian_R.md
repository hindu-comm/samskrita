Sir, 'Thank you for the in depth analysis and clarifications quoting appropriate references. My apologies for my inability to write in Sanskrit. However, I beg to state that I have come across the instrumental form of भवान् as भवता. I think it also appears in पितृ कर्म something like - भवता क्षण:कर्तव्य: प्राप्नोतु भवान्।

Respectfully,

R Subrahmanian
