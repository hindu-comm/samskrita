Shreevatsaji,  

  

Thank you for these links.

  

The one I downloaded from was also at [archive.org](http://archive.org). But as you say, it must have been scanned and then rendered into gibberish by means of OCR.

  

The version in the first link that you provide seems to work well.

  

Brian
