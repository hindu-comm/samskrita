Learned scholars,



I am trying to look into the Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣya of Ādi Śaṃkara for a specific and very beautiful verse. I downloaded the only version of the Bhāṣya I could find. It happens to be in EPUB format.



Here is a sample of the resulting text:



 I! sft: II

 w^r: - • • 3—3.

 3^r^f^\<wr: ... i

 ?sr^r^^^wrc^ w^ ... 3.

 ^rrararaijnp^ ... ^

 3^\*n?i\*wfarrfori \*r\<r\*i • • • ^

 SRSTTfoFRR ... R

 ^WxR. • • • ^

 SWT^RTOt^ ... ^—^

 srflR^ ^!«rrer ^9Ti%q: ... ^

 S. \\V. I. I



Does anyone here recognize this encoding? Is there any way to translated it into something legible?

  

Or I suppose I might ask, does anyone know of a legible version of the Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣya that a person could download, or copy from a website?  



Thanks in advance,



Brian to
