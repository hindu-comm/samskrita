Where did you download it from? Without looking at the source, it is not clear what the problem is.In any case, these don't look like encoding issues, but rather OCR errors. For instance, the Internet Archive ([archive.org](http://archive.org)) does OCR (optical character-recognition) on its PDF books or TIF books, to publish them in EPUB, text, and other formats. Because the OCR systems are not tuned for Devanagari, they try to read the Devanagari text as English letters, and spew out gibberish like this.

  

Here is a well-typeset PDF version of what appears to the Brahma Sutra Bhashya of Adi Shankara, as you want:

Also available are Sanskrit commentaries:

\* <http://www.archive.org/details/The.Brahmasutra.Sankara.Bhasya.with.Bhamati.Kalpataru.and.Parimala> (Brahmasutra Bhashya, with Bhamati of Vachaspati Misra, Kalpataru of Amalananda and Parimala of Appaya Dikshita)

\*<http://www.archive.org/details/The.Brahmasutra.Sankara.Bhasya.with.Ratna-Prabha.Bhamati.and.Nyaya-Nirnaya>

and an English translation:
