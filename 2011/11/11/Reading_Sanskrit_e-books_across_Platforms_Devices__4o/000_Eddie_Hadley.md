All,



 The current proliferation of e-books, in their multiple formats and multiple reading devices,

 can make for some frustration when your particular viewing platform does not support the format.



 However, help is at hand.

 Information on the subject can be found here:



<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB>



Towards the bottom are two tables:

*Reading Systems and Software*,

and

*Editing systems* - software to convert across platforms, formats and devices, towards the bottom:



Some such software is free, I am taking a look at what *Calibre* can do:

So far, I have managed to convert from an EPUB format to pdf and rtf, for reading on my desktop PC.

Itâ€™s not perfect, but at least I am able to read the texts.



The source texts themselves, do need to be non-commercial, i.e. open source.



 Eddie
