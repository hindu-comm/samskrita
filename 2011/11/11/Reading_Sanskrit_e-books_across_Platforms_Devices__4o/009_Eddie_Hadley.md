Arvind,

The British billion is different from the Canadian billion, in that it  
has 12 zeroes, not nine.

And again, in Arabic, what looks to Westerners like a zero, is actually the  
five. On mobile phones, it lends itself to to a bit of confusion!

Optimal experience is only possible in the next world. Until then, our  
devices, made in the China, programmed in America, must speak in a Unicoded  
language of 1,000,000 letters - as has already been explained (: -).

  
Eddie
