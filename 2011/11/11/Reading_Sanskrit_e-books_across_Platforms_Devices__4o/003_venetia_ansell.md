Hi Eddie,

If you need to add comments and so on to the text there are some eReading devices that offer that - you need to look for one which is aimed at the higher education market rather than the general consumer market. For instance there is a special Kindle designed for students which has better facilities for this kind of thing.

If you need to copy and paste text from pdf/epub to Word or some other editor and work on it, that should be easy with English but very difficult with Sanskrit because typesetting Sanskrit often requries using a special code to input the characters adn so when you copy paste from the pdf you end up with the code not the characters.

Best,

Venetia
