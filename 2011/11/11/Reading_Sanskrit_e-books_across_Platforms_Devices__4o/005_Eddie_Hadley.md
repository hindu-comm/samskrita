Santo,



 Yes, but only about 0.00001% of about 6 billion inhabitants of this planet, can actually read the Devanāgarī script that these ancient writings are e-booked in, and as to the particular language written in that script . . . add a few more noughts.



The *Devanāgarī* is the problem for such as I, not EPUB – hence the usefulness of such as the *calibre* software to enable us to *Romanise* it.



I have Firefox, and I’ve downloaded the plug-in you mention, but not used it yet.
