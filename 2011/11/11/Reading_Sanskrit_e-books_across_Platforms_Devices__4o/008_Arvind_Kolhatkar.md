The number of people for whom Devanagari is the 'mother'script is far  
larger than 0.00001% of 6 billion mentioned by Eddie Hadley above.  
(If you have not already noticed the population figure just crossed  
the 7 billion mark a couple of weeks ago!). Just Hindi and Marathi  
put together, and allowing for high rates of illiteracy in India,  
leads to a potential Devanagari readership base of 1.2  
billion\*48%\*25%=144 million. This is a huge market and book  
publishers of India seem to be realizing the potential of this  
untapped market. This is reflected in the growing number of websites  
offering e-reading of some kind or another.  
  
I, for one, would like to read the latest Marathi books online or via  
downloading if it is made user-friendly. This last thing, however,  
seems to be lacking so far. I am bewildered by the plethora of  
formats and gadgets involved in e-reading and people like me would  
welcome advise as to the best combination of these so as to optimize  
the experience.
