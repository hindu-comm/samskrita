Venetia,



 Not many people know this, but it is quite easy to obtain all the text from a PDF.



The necessary fonts that the document uses, are listed under the Document Properties menu item in the PDF Reader. All that is required to be able to extract all the text, is that they be present on the user’s device, such as this user’s PC.



Embedded fonts are what makes the PDF format portable - to any user, whatever his platform or device.



Once those fonts, which are freely and easily obtained from sites such as <http://www.ffonts.net>, are installed at the user’s end, the Sanskrit is just as ava

ilable as the English.



The main purpose of embedding fonts, being not for protection, but for portability, as indeed most of them are.



Provided an unprotected ‘e-book’ format is converted to an edit friendly format, all is possible.



For example, those ancient ***words can be better understood when read in ones native language script***, especially once the individual words are separated out.
