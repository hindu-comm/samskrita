If you meant the billion with twelve zeros, your estimation of world population is off by three orders of magnitude - we are a thousand times less than that, unless you included other species especially arthropods. If you meant the Billion with nine zeros your estimate of people being able to read devanagari is an underestimate by five or more likely six orders of magnitude. I am curious if the British percent is different from the Canadian percent. :)
