Venetia,



“Thanks for this Eddie. Are you reading English (or romanised Sanskrit) or content in Devanagari? “



Not so much reading, as writing. I want to be able to transliterate and interpret portions of the contents.



Much out of copyright material, though unprotected, is designed for on-line reading, rather than for off-line editing.

So, for such as I, conversion to a suitable format is a must. The actual device is not important – but preferably one with a 22 inch screen and room for a coffee pot.



 Eddie
