Thanks for this Eddie. Are you reading English (or romanised Sanskrit) or content in Devanagari?



epub is supported on most major ereading platforms and devices bar Amazon's Kindle. However, because each company puts a different form of DRM (digital rights management) on their epub files, it can mean that you can't transfer them between devices so that a Barnes & Noble eBook for instance may not be able to be read on the iBooks application on the iPad even though both are using epub, because B&N may have a different DRM to Apple. However, you could get round this by downloading the eReading app from the retailer in question and using that on your iPad or whichever device you have. So for example you can still read Amazon's mobi files on the iPad by reading them through the iPad Kindle app.
