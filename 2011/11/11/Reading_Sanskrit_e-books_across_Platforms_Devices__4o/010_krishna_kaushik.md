The number of Devanagari users is not only limited to India.

  

The script has a far wider usage; and in many other countries the script has found her (its) rightful honour and place.

Guyana, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius, Fiji and numerous countries in African continent have millions of Devanagari users.

There are several mass-communication media such as magazines and newspapers printed using Devanagari script.

  

There are many schools in England, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Canada, Argentina, China, Japan, Australia etc. where Sanskrit and other Aryan languages are taught. These languages are written and taught using the Devanagari script by the schools/Universities in these countries also.

  

I think this should be considered as a global script, used for Sanaskrit but not restricted to Sanskrit or Indian masses.

  

The script - Devanagari - has a far wider usage than is being considered here, in this discussion
