The number is much much higher.

As a crude estimate, 17% of the world's population is in India,74% of India is literate,41% of India speaks Hindi, 7% speaks Marathi, and a fair number of other language speakers learn Hindi at school. This gives a rough estimate of 6%; the actual number is probably between 1% and 10%.

Either way, the number is several orders of magnitude higher than "0.00001% of 6 billion" which is only 600 people. :-)

  

More relevantly, I would not be surprised if a fair number of this group (or Sanskrit readers) would like to read their Sanskrit text in Devanagari.EPUB still had poor support for Devanagari, the last time I checked.

  

However, I do support open formats like EPUB (or even plain text) over hard-to-modify formats like PDF or, worse, the page scans in the form of images. But the content is more important than the format, and if a rare book is only available as a scan, that is the format one will have to read it in.

Though I have hope for EPUB, I'm not convinced it will stop the proliferation of ebook formats... the process is all too familiar:<http://xkcd.com/927/> :-)
