Shreevatsa,



There are vowels and there are ambiguous vowels.



Allowing for continental drift away from the original 9th and 10th to the current 7th, the most notable feature of language is its flexibility.



It is one of the very first features, along with that of the rude words, that the small people cotton on to.

Otherwise known as ambiguity, it usefully makes them very difficult to pin down.



A ‘pure’ vowel is properly termed a *cardinal* vowel.



Then there is the rag bag of the impure:

 *the ambiguous vowel* – a sequence is a phonetic string (segment or sequence) that may be interpreted as a

 diphthong

 two separate vowels

 a vowel and a consonant.



Finally, not only impure but also ambiguous, comes the troublesome ṛ



Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the *rhotic* vowel (otherwise known as the vocalic r, which you just might have *heard* of from somewhere before (;-).

Being not so much a vowel and a consonant as a consonant and a vowel.

It is subject that all good Scotsmen are versed in.

 Eddie
