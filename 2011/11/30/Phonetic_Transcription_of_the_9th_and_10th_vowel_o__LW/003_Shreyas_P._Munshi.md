Thnx Eddie. I sent the request only because I too could not find specific phonetic description.What you have detailed is what i had found in MW dictionary but it does not give the phonetic description (by following which one can produce the said vowel sound, if it is a vowel at all! Sanskrit school books till today include them in the list of vowels).  
Regards...Shreyas
