Vinodh Ji,

  

Thank you very much for you lucidexplanation onthe difference betweenऌ andलृ.  

  

So, as I have understood now,लृ isल्+ऋ. The occurrence ofऌ (the pure vowel), however, is quite rare, isn't it?I think, the only root that has this sound isकॢप्.

  

Are there any **Vedic Sanskrit** words/roots with this sound apart fromकॢप्?

  

Also, doesलृ (derivative ofल्+ऋ)occur in the proper Sanskrit words (I mean those that are not used in the technical vocabulary) ?

  

Thanks and Regards,

Aniruddha
