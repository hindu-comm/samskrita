PS.

The idea is to describe the –sound- .

The words and letters used in the written description, are irrelevant.



It does of course, depend on familiarity with the spoken form of the language in which the description is written.



English having as it does, more than the one sound for a given letter, there is the necessity to spell out a word, along with a particular combination of its letters, to convey the pronunciation of a particular –sound-.



The actual letter, be it vowel, diphthong or consonant, being –sounded- may well differ from the one(s) written.

Indeed there may well not even be a corresponding letter present in the native script.

The –sound- is that made by the ‘lry’ as sounded by a native English -speaker-.

And is indeed discernably different from the ‘r’ –sound- as in the word ‘try’, for example.

Even in Charles Wikner’s South African English, it is so!



The reason for the existence of IPA, is that it avoids the multifarious regional variations.

Even so, it all begs the question that there is indeed a universal pronunciation of these things.
