Shreyas,



 “but it does not give the phonetic description (by following which one can produce the said vowel sound”



The one, ऌ *resembling the sound lry in revelry*.



The other, ॡ *does not exist*.





I think something maybe getting lost in the translation, here.



What, for example, would constitute a “phonetic description” (or descriptions) of the first vowel to you, that enables you to produce it?



Assuming that by ‘produce it’ you mean ‘pronounce it’, there are no shortages of audio guides, e.g. <http://www.tilakpyle.com/sanskrit_alphabet.htm>
