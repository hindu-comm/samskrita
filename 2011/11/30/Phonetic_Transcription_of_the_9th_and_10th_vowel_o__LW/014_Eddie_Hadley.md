Shreyas,



Phonetics is a specialist subject, articulatory phonetics, even more so.

As also is the disparity between the written word and its etymology.



It’s a phenomenon of language in general, not limited to Sanskrit.



May I suggest that the path to phonetic enlightenment be better realised by the perusal of such as the following, currently lying open upon my desk and to which I refer.



*Describing Language* by *Open University Press*



Chapter two provides much more detail than can be justifyingly provided to you here.



Section 2.3, entitled *Segmental Phonology* has a sub section that explains the composite nature of sounds, and that speech is a continuous movement of the vocal organs (not many people know that).

It acknowledges that in the transition from one sound to another, we can find some rather strange sounds which are not normally regarded as occurring (let alone have letters or names).



A further sub section is entitled *The influence of surrounding sounds*

**(but does not include the sound of one hand clapping).



Chapter 4 entitled *Meaning* may also be of interest.

(One man’s *meaning* is not necessarily another man’s meanings - it’s a question of semantics).



My edition dates from 2001, yours may differ.



As your employment of such big words, belies you assertion of being a beginner, I’m sure you are aware of the relative natures of the written word and the spoken word. To describe sounds in written words, is to illustrate the flight of the humming bird with a still photo from camera, and as to the humming . . .



A radically different instrument and media is required.



 Eddie



 Semantics is not everyone’s cup of tea - I’m a coffee man myself!
