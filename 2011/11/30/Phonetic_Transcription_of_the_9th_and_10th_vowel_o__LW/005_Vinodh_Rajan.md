Nope. ऌ doesn't have kind of 'r' sound.



ऌ is quite different from लृ ( ल् + ऋ )



The forms are quite similar only in Devanagari (hence the confusion).



The shapes are quite different in otherSouth Asian and South East AsianScripts (which are not related to Nagari Script) where ऌ has an independant shape, and लृ is clearly shown as a derivative of ल with ऋ.
