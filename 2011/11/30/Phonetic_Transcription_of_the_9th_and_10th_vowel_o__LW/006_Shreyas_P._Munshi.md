Respected Eddie Sir,  
You ask: "What, for example, would constitute a “phonetic description” (or descriptions) of the first vowel to you, that enables you to produce it?"  
  
In fact, Eddie Sir, that is exactly what I want to know.  
  
A phonetic description of a sound helps one to 'produce' that sound.  
  
The parameters for producing a consonant sound and a vowel sound are somewhat different.For consonants the three features of phonetic description usually used are: place of articulation, manner of articulation and phonation (state of vocal cords:whether they are vibrating or not). For vowels the usual three parameters used are: the tongue height (high or low), the front-ness or back-ness of the tongue (front or back) and the shape taken by lips (rounded or unrounded).  
  
For example, among consonants, say,the first sound of the Sanskrit word 'timir'(darkness)is 't' whose phonetic description would read 'unvoiced dental plosive'. This would tell the reader (or listener) that while producing this 't-sound', the vocal cords are not vibrating (hence 'unvoiced'), the tip of the tongue touches the teeth, (usually and more so in this case,the tip of the tongue would touch the upper part of the backside of the row of upper teeth, hence 'dental)and the manner of articulation is 'plosive' that is the breath is held for a moment and suddenly released, like exploding, hence 'plosive'.  
  
For a vowel, say, 'i'/i/, the phonetic description would most likely read 'high, front, unrounded' just as for /u/, it would read :high, back, rounded'  
.  
Guided by the above phonetic descriptions one can 'produce' the sounds 't', 'i' and 'u' anywhere, anytime irrespective of the language..  
  
Additionally, the phonetic description helps one to know that the 't' of Sanskrit 'timir' is different from the 't' of English 'table' whose (the latter's) phonetic description would be : 'voiceless alveolar plosive''  
  
I want to humbly know how to produce the sounds of the 9th and 10th vowel of Sanskrit alphabet.The sound in 'revelry' is a consonant sound whereas the Sanskrit school books even today include both the sounds in question in the list of vowels.  
  
I hope you now understand my difficulty in 'producing' the sounds in question as a 'vowel sounds'. To my simple mind, this is a fundamental query and, at the risk of looking 'naive', I am honestly looking for help.  
Submitted with regards...Shreyas
