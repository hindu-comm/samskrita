Shreyas



“I could not find the specific phonetic transcription of the Sanskrit vowels ऌ and ॡ.”



 They would appear to be somewhat rare.



1\. ḷ

 • the ninth vowel of the alphabet (resembling the sound lry in revelry.; it only appears in some forms of √kḷp). \[227,1\]



1\. ḹ

 • the tenth vowel of the alphabet (the corresponding long vowel to ḷ, entirely artificial and only appearing in the works of some
grammarians and lexicographers). \[227,1\]





However, this table gives the IPA phonetics for those characters albeit as Hindi pronunciation of the Devanāgarī.
