These are a \[sic\]combinations. Of consonant and vowel.

Used to qualify a consonant, as in the phrase vocalic l, It refers to a blend of the Sanskrit l consonant sound and the Sanskrit ṛ vowel.

A vowel is phonological.  
What pray, would be an unphonological vowel?

Respected Eddie Sir,  
For 1 and 2: These two together constitute the very doubt that comes to my simple un-evolved mind. How to pronounce the sounds in question as vowels?  
  
If consonant's combinings are required for pronouncing (producing) these sounds,why should they be included in the list of pure Sanskrit vowels like a aa i I u U e o and diphthongs ai,au etc(one would notice that even the diphthongs are the result of gliding of one pure vowel into another pure vowel, not a combination with any consonant). My query has been how to pronounce, as vowels, the sounds represented graphically as ऋ ṛ R RRi/R^i and ऌ ḷ lR i/L^i. I am just a learner, Eddie Sir.  
  
Regarding your PS at 3:  
I am told, the sounds like English /i/ and /u/ are phonological vowels; they are produced as vowels and used as such in all environments; whereas English sounds like /y/ and /w/ are pnonetic vowels, in the sense that they are produced like vowels (the flexible articulators dont touch any fixed articulators) and are used as vowels all over (mostly in diphthongs)except in the word-initial positions like 'yet' and 'wet' where it is impossible to produce these sounds without the flexible articulators touching the fixed articulators in the oral cavity; and that is why they are, perhaps,termed semi-vowels (Pike called them 'vocoids' to differentiate between them and the vowel sounds like /i/ and /u/).  
  
The situation with Sanskrit sounds ऋ ṛ R RRi/R^i and ऌ ḷ lR  
i/L^i is different; they were produced as vowel sounds perhaps during Panini's time in the word initial position but elsewhere they changed to -ar,-ir,-al etc.  
  
If we accept ऋ ṛ R RRi/R^i and ऌ ḷ lR i/L^i as approximants and not as pure vowels, everything that you and Wikner say falls in place, not if we treat them (can we at all?) as pure vowel sounds.  
Submitted for being enlightened...Shreyas
