A year or two ago, there was an article in the Samskrit monthly Sambhashana sandesha about the pronunciation of the vowels in question. The back issues of the magazine are available online. But it is not searchable. Does anyone remember the article I am talking about?  
  
Also, our list member Dhananjay Vaidya had done a series of podcasts on articulation. I'll dig up the links later.
