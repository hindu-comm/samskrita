Shreyas,



”However, I am still unable to understand how to pronounce the phonological vowels ऋ and लृ without the syllable onset of consonants र् and ल्र् .”



 You can’t.



By definition, a vocalic consonant need a consonant as well as an existing vowel!



It is not a *new* vowel. It is a new *sound*.



These are a *combinations.* Of consonant *and* vowel.





*vocalic*

 Vocalic is an adjective.

****

** vocalic**, *adj.*

** 1.** of, pertaining to, or resembling a vowel.

** 2.** consisting of, characterized by, *or containing vowels*.



Used to qualify a consonant, as in the phrase *vocalic l,* It refers to a *blend* of the Sanskrit l consonant sound *and* the Sanskrit ṛ vowel.



Have you read Wikner’s description of these articulations?

He is quite clear that they are combinations of sounds.



Have a pencil ready and hear them for yourself!



Voice prints will show the difference.



Even so, opportunities to employ your newly acquired articulations are rather limited.





Others more eloquent than I, may be better able to assist you with your labours.



Eddie





PS.



A vowel *is* phonological.

What pray, would be an unphonological vowel?
