Thank you very much Dr Bhat Sir for your detailed information. However, I am still unable to understand how to pronounce the phonological vowels ऋ and लृ without the syllable onset of consonants र् and ल्र् .  
  
Is it the case that we have long forgotten how to pronounce ऋ and लृ as vowels as was probably done at the time when Panini compiled the Sanskrit alphabet? And if it is so, should the R-coloured approximant ऋ and the L-coloured approximant लृ still be included in the list of Sanskrit vowels, as is trditionally done till today? Or we should accept the sound change and place them at proper places in the consonant chart?  
Regards...Shreyas

This site gives a list of the consonants produced in the respective articulation points" etc. They differ in the exertion of the passage of air k to m are called स्पर्श. य, र, ल, व are considered अन्तःस्थ and they are considered as semi-vowels. Thus, when it comes to distinguish between the vowel state of these from their corresponding consonant state, it is little confusing to make a distinction by description but hard to distinguish in pronunciation. For example, इ and ई from यि, यी, and so र् from ऋ , alone it would be hard to distinguish, and so ल् consonant from लृ and ल् + ऋ ० लृ. or र्+ऋ ० from the vowel ऋ. These are having common articulation points and only the distinguishing is when they are considered as hard consonants + vowel and when they are vowels alone.

  
  
  
  
Technically, लृ, तवर्ग, ल, स all are have dental (not strictly teeth, but the place of the mouth near to the upper part of the mouth as you can see in the chart). Now the differentiation between the consonant र् + ऋ and vowel only from the vowel लृ and the combined form ल्+ऋ as it appears in writing which was attributed to similiarity in the script. But all the same, the vowel is present in only one verb क्लृप्+त ० or the augmentations to many roots in the list of roots, serving certain grammatical purposes. गम्लृ गतौ, पत्लृ, षद्लृ etc. which have different forms in aorist past due to this augmentation. Otherwise, it is a rare vowel. The problem in pronunciation is similar in the earlier cases also.
