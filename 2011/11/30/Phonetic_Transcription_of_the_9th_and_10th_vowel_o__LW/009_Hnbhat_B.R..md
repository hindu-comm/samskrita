The articulation points are represented in the above chart.

whole of Sanskrit alphabet is produced by touching the relevant articulation points described as in the शिक्षा and व्याकरण texts.

  

This site gives a list of the consonants produced in the respective articulation points. They differ in the exertion of the passage of air k to m are called स्पर्श. य, र, ल, व are considered अन्तःस्थ and they are considered as semi-vowels. Thus, when it comes to distinguish between the vowel state of these from their corresponding consonant state, it is little confusing to make a distinction by description but hard to distinguish in pronunciation. For example, इ and ई from यि, यी, and so र् from ऋ , alone it would be hard to distinguish, and so ल् consonant from लृ and ल् + ऋ ० लृ. or र्+ऋ ० from the vowel ऋ. These are having common articulation points and only the distinguishing is when they are considered as hard consonants + vowel and when they are vowels alone.  

  

Technically, लृ, तवर्ग, ल, स all are have dental (not strictly teeth, but the place of the mouth near to the upper part of the mouth as you can see in the chart). Now the differentiation between the consonant र् + ऋ and vowel only from the vowel लृ and the combined form ल्+ऋ as it appears in writing which was attributed to similiarity in the script. But all the same, the vowel is present in only one verb क्लृप्+त ० or the augmentations to many roots in the list of roots, serving certain grammatical purposes. गम्लृ गतौ, पत्लृ, षद्लृ etc. which have different forms in aorist past due to this augmentation. Otherwise, it is a rare vowel. The problem in pronunciation is similar in the earlier cases also.
