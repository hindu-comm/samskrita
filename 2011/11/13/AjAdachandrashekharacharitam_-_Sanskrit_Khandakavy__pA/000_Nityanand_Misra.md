Namaste All,  
  
Ājādacandraśekharacaritam is a minor Sanskrit poem of 306 verses (divided in two parts of 151 and 155 verses) on the life of the Indian freedom fighter [Chandrashekhar Azad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_Azad). It was composed in 1974 by Prajñācakṣu [Jagadguru Rambhadracharya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambhadracharya), then known as Giridhara Miśra, when he was a student of Ācārya (Master of Arts) in Vyākaraṇa at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. The work was composed at the insistence of Paṇḍita Dvijendranātha Miśra Nirguṇa, the then head of department of Sāhitya (Literature) at the University. A copy of the work was published in 1996 by the Shri Raghav Sahitya Prakashan Nidhi (Haridwar) with a Sanskrit Anvaya (paraphrase) and Hindi commentary by Gītā Devī Miśra.  
  
A scanned copy of the work is available [here](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/ViewContent/pdfs/Jagadguru%20Rambhadracharya%20-%20Ajadacandrasekaracaritam.pdf) for those interested in reading it. The resolution is low to keep the file size small, a PDF version with embedded fonts would be available soon.  
  
Excerpts from the work  
  
\[When Azad as a 14-year old is flogged 15 times for participating in the Non-cooperation movement\]  
यदा यदा वेत्रलताप्रहारं तस्मिन् सकोपोऽनुचरश्चकार ।  
तदा तदा सिंहरवेण वीरो जगर्ज बालो जय भारतेति ॥ १-१३१ ॥  
As and when the enraged orderly \[of the prison\] flogged him (Azad) with the whip \[fifteen times\], the brave boy roared aloud in the voice like that of a lion - *Victory to Bhārata*!  
  
  
\[When Azad met other revolutionaries\]  
स राजगुर्वादिनिजानुगामिनः सभक्तसिंहान् बटुकेश्वरादिकान् ।  
उपेत्य तान् रामदशास्यसंयुगे प्रवीरकर्मान् हनुमानिवाबभौ ॥ २-५ ॥  
On obtaining his followers led by Shivram Rajguru, with the likes of Batukeshwar Dutt and accompanied by Bhagat Singh, he (Azad) shone forth like Hanuman on obtaining the brave monkeys in the battle of Rāma and Rāvaṇa.  
  
  
\[When Azad killed himself fighting the colonial soldiers at Azad Park (Alfred Park), Allahabad\]  
एवं विधाय कदनं कलुषात्मकानां निर्मथ्य गौरजलधिं सुभटः प्रदोषे ।  
लीलां समाप्य सगुणां निजरौद्रभावं त्यक्त्वा शशाम शिववत्प्रलयावसाने ॥ २-१५० ॥  
Thus, after performing the destruction of those with a sinful character, after churning the ocean of the colonial rulers, after concluding his play with qualities, after discarding his fiery disposition, he obtained peace in \[that\] evening like Śiva at the end of the dissolution of the universe.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
