श्रीमन् शंकरवर्य !  
  
What made you think that hackers have to give a reason ? Their symbols and announcements are the reason !  
  
The other day I visited the Pagoda in Mumbai, possibly, the largest in the world. An inscription on the wall said, "When sect becomes more important and truth becomes secondary, in the name of religion, people will be killed !  
  
May I add ... Websites will be hacked, for reason or no reason !!  
  
It all brings to mind the shloka in 14th chapter of गीता - रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय सत्त्वं भवति भारत । रजः सत्त्वं तमश्चैव तमः सत्त्वं रजस्तथा ।।  
Hacking websites, supposedly not in line with their minds, is proof of how तमः सत्त्वं तथा रजः अभिभूय भवति ।  
The challenge is how to make सत्त्व to become established. The way shown is रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय. This is only the direction for it and not the complete process. Any ideas on the process or options to ensure रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय ?  
  
It seems, सत्त्वं तथा रजः अभिभूय is easier for तमः But it seems so much more challenging for सत्त्वं to be रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय. Why should it be so ? Why is it easier, almost always, for the vicious to overwhelm others ?  
  
Looking forward to your early restoration !

  
सस्नेहम्
