Abhyankarji,

  

You are right. Yesterday evening, I saw that the site got hacked by Jihadis. They had left their religious symbols and a message - "See the power of Pakistan, etc, etc." But, no reason was given why the site was hacked.

  

It will take a day or two to bring the site back to normalcy.



regards  
shankara
