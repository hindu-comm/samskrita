Nityanand,



“ . . . I am interested in converting texts in some Devanāgarī fonts to Unicode as well.”



You might want to take a look at the *Unicode Conversion Gateway.*



<http://uni.medhas.org/fileconverterindex.php5>





There, you can upload an Indian language text file in a legacy encoding and have it converted into Unicode.

I have tried it for DV-TTYogesh, and it works.







Also, a facility to transliterate a Web site URL, from one Indian language script to another is available at the the same site, though I haven’t tried that, myself.
