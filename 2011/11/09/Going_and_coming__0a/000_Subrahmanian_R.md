What is the difference between गतम् and गमनम् \[and thus between आगतम् and आगमनम्\].

सु + आगतम् = स्वागतम्; स्वागतं कृष्ण शरणागतं कृष्ण ।

पुस्तकं वनिता वित्तं परहस्तं गतं गतम्।

प्रेमत्रपाप्रणि हितानि गतागतानि।

कञ्जदलायदाक्षि - - - कुञ्जर गमने -- \[in Dikshitra Kriti\]

In Ranjanamala by another composer: मन्दगमनी word is used to describe the gait.

Thus the feminine form appears to have two different spellings: गमना and गमनी

In most of the airports for 'Arrival' आगमन or आगमनम् is used.

To my mind गमनम् and आगमनम् appear to have the sense of going and coming as a gerundive noun;

Whereas, गतं looks like a completed action - gone. But in 'स्वागतम्’ it does not appear to denote past action.

For example, the invitation circular for World Sanskrit Conference to be held about two months from now says

'स्वागताय’.

Can some learned member throw some light for me.
