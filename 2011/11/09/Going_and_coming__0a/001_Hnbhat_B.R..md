Both usages are found in Monier Williams as well come, and welcome in English :

  
)स्व्-ागत\[p=1283,2\]\[L=259581\]mfn.(forस्वा\*गत»  
\[p=1277,2\]) well come , welcomeR.

  
स्व्-ागत\[L=259587\]n.welcome , greeting , salutation (स्वागतं तेwith or withoutअस्तु, " I wish you welcome ")MBh.Ka1v.&c  
  
Etymologically it has got to meanings. The action of coming well and the wishing of welcoming as it appears in the English equivalent.

  

In the usage, स्वागताय is just means for the welcome (speech or act of reception) in modern Sanskrit. स्वागतं कृष्ण also is used in the same meaning as welcome to you Krishna if translated to English.  
  
Whereas gamana or aagamana, svaagamana - etc. will mean the act of coming only and not used as the participle as in आगतः, स्वागतः, स्वागतम्, used in three genders. It is used to denote the action only in
neuter gender and doesn't take any other gender.  
  
Hope this will clear your doubt. मन्दगमना is correct as a ब्रहुव्रीहि compound and मन्दगमनि is not as I know grammatically correct though in music compositions it can be found. (which need not heed to grammatical accuracy, than the composition of the music meant for). But the Sanskrit word popular is मन्दगामिनी.
