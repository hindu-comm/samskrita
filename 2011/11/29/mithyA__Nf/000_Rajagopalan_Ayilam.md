Dear all,  
  
I am looking for a suitable Sanskrit word for " falsehood" for one of my translation excercises. I got the word "मिथ्या " from the dictionary. But it is an "avyaya" and cannot be used (correct me if I am wrong) in the sense of falshood as the word "falsehood" is a noun. Now my question is whether I can add tvam to it and make it "मिथ्यात्वं" to get the meaning of falsehood. Of course there few other words like मृषाद्यं, असत्यं, etc can be used for falshood.  
  
Another question is what is the "vigrahavakya" of "मिथ्यावादी "। (this word also I got from the dictionary)  
  
I would be grateful it the learned members can throw light on these questions.
