Ramakrishnan is right. There is no corresponding meaning in the dictionaries.

  

By context, it should mean the same reed referred to in the previous verse split earlier now thrown displacing their sides "vyatyaya."  
which was earlier thrown in the same into two halves without changing their parts. In other words, it should be synonym of "naDa" referred to earlier. "tam iriNam" the word being "iriNa" or "irin" or "tamirin" The editors have given the meaning as narkaT the same as reed in the notes for the verse in Gorakhpur Edition. I will check in other editins also in the mean time.

  

Could not find in any other Dictionaries referred to by me.
