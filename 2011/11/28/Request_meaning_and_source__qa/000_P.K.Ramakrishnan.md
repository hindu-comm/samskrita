Mahabharata - Sisupalavadha



When Bhima was fighting with Sisupala hand to hand Krishna who was watching indicated to Bhima what he should do to kill Sisupala. The following is a quotation from Mahabharata Sabhaparva Adhyaya 24



ततस्तु भगवान् कृष्णो जरासंधजिघांसया /

भीमसेनं समालोक्य **नलं** जग्राह पाणिना //

द्विधा चिच्छेद वै तत् तु जरासंधवधं प्रति /



Bhima understood the hint and tore

Jarasandha into two. However the

two halves joined together. Jarasandha

became alive and fighting. Then Krishna

did like this.



पुन: कृष्ण**स्तमिरिणं** द्विधा विच्छिद्य माधव: /

व्यत्यस्य प्राक्षिपत् तत् तु जरासंधवधेप्सया //



Here I have marked two words in black.

The meaning of nala is given as a kind of reed

in the dictionary.



But I could not locate the second word tamirin

anywhere in any dictionary.



Could someone give the meaning and source?
