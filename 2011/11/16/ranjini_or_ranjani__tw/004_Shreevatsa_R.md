Yes, see

  

\* Monier Williams:  

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?key=raJjanI>

which has a lot of definitions including "pleasing, charming,...", versus

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?key=raJjinI>

which has only the definition

"N. of various plants (the indigo plant , Rubia Munjista &c ) L. (cf. रञ्जनी)"

  

\* Apte:

<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:4913.apte>

"रञ्जन a. (-नी f.)" has the meanings listed, there is also

<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:4914.apte>

forरञ्जनी itself,

whileरञ्जिनी is not present anywhere in the dictionary.

  

Good observation aboutरजिनि /रजिनी. These incorrect forms are nowhere in the dictionary; although the formरजनि sometimes occurs as a variant of the more commonरजनी.
