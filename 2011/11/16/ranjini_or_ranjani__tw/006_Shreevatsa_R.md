Thank you for this informative observation, Dr. Bhat. I thought that (at least the stem forms of) all grammatical forms would be present (or at least indicated) in the good dictionaries. (E.g.रञ्जिनी is not in the dictionary => it's not a valid word.)

Now that I know that is not the case, I will also try to search a corpus in future.

  

Thanks and regards,

Shreevatsa
