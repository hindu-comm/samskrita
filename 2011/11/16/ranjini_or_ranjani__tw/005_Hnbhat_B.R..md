Itself means both are grammatically correct forms and nothing else.

  

As for the names, both रसिकरञ्जनी or रसिकरञ्जिनी (a combination of राग is known by that name) are correct and mean the same. It is the same with the title भकरञ्जनी or भक्तरञ्जिनी which can be explained grammatically:

  

भक्तान् रञ्जयतीति - भक्तरञ्जनी or भक्तरञ्जिनी which also would not be found in any Dictinary. All the possible grammatical derivations need not be found in all the dictionaries, but only collected from the corpus they have compiled the dictionary.
