Sometimes, some popular persons change their names for Numerology or for any reason. The world follows them. eg Rajani is hardly used - in contemporary, popular use it has become rajini, thanks to the popular actor Rajinikant. Ranjani, ranjini could be one such. Further, as per MW ranjana and ranjini are listed. There is reference in these entries as cf: ranjani, cf: jana-ranjani, though I am unable to locate such listing.
