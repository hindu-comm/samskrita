Hi All,

  

I remember reading a Sanskrit Play some years ago, and I had also bookmarked it for later reading \[which didn't happen\].

  

The following are the bits and pieces I could recollect from the scant reading that I did back then.

  

The play is of religious nature and is set in Kashmir. One specific scene is that, The Buddhist Monks are described as living lavishly in amonastery. They are served with meat bought from the market which is \[mockingly\] described as thrice purified \[Trikoti Shuddha Mamsa\]. (The specific sentence was something like, "The disciples of the Son of Shuddhadona are served with thrice purified meat bought from the market")

  

Other than this, I don't seem to recollect any other information.

  

Any Idea about the Play's Title ?
