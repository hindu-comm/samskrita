Namaste,  
  
Commenting of Aṣṭādhyāyī 3.1.29: ṛter īyaṅ, Kāśikā says, this is a sautra dhātu. Sautra dhātu means a dhātu used in the sūtras. Is it that we never use any sautra dhātu in other writings?  
  
Also,  
Why 'chattra' is often spelt as 'chatra'? Is there any rule for using only one 't'?  
Why 'budhyati' is often spelt as 'buddhyati'? Any rule for the extra 'd' used?  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
