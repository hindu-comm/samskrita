Function of the Sutra-s is to explain and describe forms in use in the language Panini was handling and not our language now we use in 21st Century and his reasoning may not sound well within the reach of our knowledge of linguistics today.

  

For re-dupplication rules, one has to learn from the rules and there are many online tutorials to do this. And learning from any traditional Grammar Text also would help.
