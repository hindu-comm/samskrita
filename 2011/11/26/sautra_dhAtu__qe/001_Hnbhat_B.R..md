It is nominally derived with the suffix ष्ट्रन् - त्र from the root छद् + त्र - छत्त्र. It is not optional. The same with मित्त्र etc. many others. I can't remember any rule eliding one of them.

Here also there is no need for a second "d" as the verb contains only बुध् + य+ति - बुध्यति। but analogically with बुद्धिः, its duplicated in pronunciation, but there is no need to duplicate. But due to the operation of "अनचि च" (८।४।४७) it can be optionally duplicated and hence both the forms in orthography can be justified.
