Dhanyavādaḥ Bhatji,  
  
Your answer for optional reduplication in 'buddhyati' was excellent. I will be thankful if you or other members can explain more about optional reduplication for 'chattra'. Also please explain to me, what is the use of sautra dhātus if they are only used in sūtras? Is it just to explain the function of a sūtra?  
  
Regards,  
Prasad.
