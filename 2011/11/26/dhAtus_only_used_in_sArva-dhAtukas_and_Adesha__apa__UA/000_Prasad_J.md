Namaste,  
  
In addition to my previous questions, got some more questions. Writing in a new thread.  
  
1. Some dhātus only function in sārva-dhātukas but not in ārdha-dhātukas. Ex. Aṣṭādhyāyī 2.4.53 bruvo vaciḥ. ‘brū’ changes to ‘vac’ for ārdha-dhātukas. Are they called as ‘defective verb’? Any explanation from Pāṇini or others?  
  
2. Are the ādeśas equivalent to apavādas? If no, then what are the advantages or disadvantages of these over each other?  
  
Dhanyavādaḥ.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad.
