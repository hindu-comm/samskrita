Pāṇiniexplains the usage of the verbs. But doesn't mention that they are defective verbs and hence you cannot expect any such explanation from Panini.

These आदेश and अपवाद are two distinct operational process named differently by their function. They are entirely different. आदेश refers to the function of substitution of any morpheme to another morpheme. It may be a syllable or word or any morpheme as such. It is in contrast with आगम as it is said शत्रुवदादेशः, मित्रवदागमः। This relates to the forms prescribed and contrast with स्थानिन्. Whereas the अपवाद is related to the classification of the rule, उत्सर्ग and अपवाद. The general rules and exceptions are the categories of the rules and how the rules function. They are called आदेश-सूत्र-s when they prescribe some आदेश substitution of any morpheme. This can be operation substituted for another, in which case it can be अतिदेश like कार्यातिदेश or रूपादेश. स्थानिवद्भाव, or असिद्धवद्भाव are the two operational substitutions. सन्वद्भाव is also another अतिदेश extension of the operation to some other place other than it is originally prescribed. This is the general practice.
