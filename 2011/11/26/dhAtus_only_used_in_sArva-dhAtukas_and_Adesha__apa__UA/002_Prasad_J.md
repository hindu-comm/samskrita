Dhanyavādaḥ Bhatji,  
  
Your answer for ādeśa or apavāda was cleared my doubts. And I will be thankful to you and other members if you can elaborate on the first question about some dhātus are not being used in ārdha-dhātukas. I know, some things in Sanskrit are understood without any apparent good reasons however there may be some reason for this.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad.
