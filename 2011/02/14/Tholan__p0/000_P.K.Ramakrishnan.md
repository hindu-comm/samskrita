In Kerala Tholan Namputhiri is known as Tholan.

He is considered as a vikatakavi. Once when he was

praying in front of the deity he said loudly.



मारारे तव दासोहं

वारियस्य जटान्तरे /

यम्प्राहुरव्ययं देवं

तन्त्रिनेत्रं नमाम्यहम् //



The temple functionaries there

viz. the Maaraar, the Vaariyar,

the Empraan and the Thantri,

hearing this ran towards him

and enquired what he was complaining

to the deity about them.



Maaraar is the drummer.

Vaariyar is the one who provides

flowers and garlands.

Empraan is the priest.

Thantri is the person who prescribes

rules for puja.



Tholan replied that he was not at all

referring to them and told them like this.



maaraari means the destroyer of Maara,

the cupid, meaning Siva.



vaariyasya is vaari yasya. Meaning

in whose Jata there is vaari or ganga.

That is Gangaadhara.



Yamprahur is yam praahu: meaning who

is said to be avyaya.



thanthrinetram is tam thrinetram. That

three eyed meaning Siva.



Hearing the explanation, they apologized and

made a hasty retreat.
