Dear All,



Enclosing a few paragraphs from Mahatma Gandhi's Autobiography where he has articulatedhis views about languages and Samskrit in particular

tushar



Samskrit, however proved a harder task. In geometry there was nothing to memorise, whereas in Samskrit, I thought, everything had to be learnt by heart. This subject was also commenced from the fourth standard. As soon as I entered the sixth I became disheartened. The teacher was a hard taskmaster; anxious as I thought, to force the boys. There was a sort of rivalry going on between the Samskrit and Persian teachers. The Persian teacher was lenient. The boys used to talk among themselves that Persian was very easy and the Persian teacher very good and considerate to the students. The \`easiness’ tempted me and one day I sat in the Persian class. The Samskrit teacher was grieved. He called me to his side and said: “How can you forget that you are a son of a Vaishnava father? Won’t you learn the language of your own religion? If you have any difficulty, why not come to me? I want to teach you students Samskrit to the best of my ability. As you proceed further you will find in it things of absorbing interest. You should not lose heart. Come and sit again in the Samskrit class.



This kindness put me to shame. I could not disregard my teacher’s affection. Today I cannot but think with gratitude of Krishnashankar Pandya. For if I had not acquired the little Samskrit that I learnt then, I should have found it difficult to take any interest in our sacred books. In fact I deeply regret that I was not able to acquire a more thorough knowledge of the language, because I have since realized that ever Hindu boy and girl should possess sound Samskrit learning.



It is my opinion that in all Indian curricula of higher education there should be place for Hindi, Samskrit, Arabian, Persian and English besides of course the vernacular. This big list need not frighten anyone. If our education were more systematic, and the boys free from burden of having to learn their subjects through a foreign medium, I am sure learning all these languages would not be an irksome task, but a perfect pleasure. A scientific knowledge of one language makes knowledge of other languages comparatively easy.



In reality Hindi, Gujarati and Samskrit may be regarded as one language and Persian and Arabic also as one. Though Persian belongs to the Aryan and Arabic to the Semitic family of languages, there is a close relationship between Persian and Arabic, because both claim their full growth through the rise of Islam. Urdu I have not regarded as a distinct language, because it has adopted the Hindi grammar and its vocabulary is mainly Persian and Arabic, and he would learn good Urdu must learn Persian and Arabic, as one would learn good Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali or Marathi must learn Samskrit.
