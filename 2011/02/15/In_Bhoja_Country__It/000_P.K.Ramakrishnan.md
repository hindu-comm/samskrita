Bhojaraja was a great patron of Sanskrit learning.

He used to honour them with fabulous presents.

A poet from a neighbouring country wanted to try his

luck. He sent a message to the king of his arrival

on a certain date.

Bhoja wanted to receive him with honour. He

arranged to recive him at the palace gate and

take him to the palace in a palanquin. He also

arranged that one of the palanquin bearers would

be Kalidasa incongnito. When the visiting poet was

being carried it was very cold. He asked the palnquin

bearer Kalidasa -

अपि शीतं बाधति?

The palanquin bearer replied.

न तथा बाधते शीतं

यथा बाधति बाधते /

Meaning that cold does not torment him as much as the

use of the word baadhati (instead of baadhate).

Baadh is atmanepadi. So baadhati is incorrect.



The visiting poet understood his mistake and thought that even

a palanquin bearer in Bhojas country was learned. How does

he expect to enter into a debate with the pundits of Bhoja's assembly.

He decided immediately to return to his country.



(Apte’s dictionary gives Kalidasa’s reply as –

na thathaa baadhathe skandham yathaa baadhati baadhate.

Here the meaning refers to the pain on the shoulder. There

is some grammatical problem in this version.)
