Bhojaraja was a patron of learning.

His capital was the city of Dhaaraa.

During his lifetime there was a tribute

to him like this.



अद्य धारा सदाधारा

सदालंबा सरस्वती /

पण्डिता मण्डिता: सर्वे

भोजराजे भुवं गते //

  

When Bhojaraaja is alive

Dhaaraa is well founded.

Saraswati is well favored.

All scholars are honored.



When he passed away there was sorrow

which is expressed in this.



अद्य धारा निराधारा

निरालंबा सरस्वती /

पण्डिता खण्डिता: सर्वे

भोजराजे दिवं गते //



When Bhojaraja has gone to heaven

Dhaaraa has become without any base.

Saraswathi is without any support.

Scholars are humiliated.
