I am afraid it is not totally free from any dosha.

  

The firstपाद would be correct either हरते or हरति metrically it doesn't change the status of theपाद. As quoted by Ramakrishnan is defective metrically and defended by Narayanaswamy somehow as archaic.The last पाद could be either त्वं तु प्राणान् धनानि च or धनान्यपि when it means wealth or money. In masculine gender, it would mean :

-   name of a merchant (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   name of Śiva (?)

according to Monier Williams. Otherwise, it would be used in neuter gender according to Amara and other lexicons:

  

"द्रव्यं वित्तं स्वापतेयं रिक्तमृक्थम् धनं वसु"
