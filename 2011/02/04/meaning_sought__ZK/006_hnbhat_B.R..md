विनाभवः-ऋदोरप् छान्दसः, विप्रयोग इति यावत् ।। 3 ।।  
अमृतकतकाख्यव्याख्या  
  
विनाभवो विनावस्थानम् ।  
Bhushana by Govindaraja  
Tilaka by Nagoji Bhatta or Ramavarma (1730-1810)  
  
विनाभवः विनाभवनम्, विनावस्थानमिति यावत् ।  
Tirtha or Tattvadipa by Mahesvara Tirtha

  

The above meaningresultant from the explanations have been summarized in dictionaries as separation as the irregular compound expresses. In Ramayana verse, there is not such irregularity (.suhridbhir vinaa bhavaH, avasthaanam), but for meaning the word bhava has to be interpreted out of sequence. "bhava" generally refers to birth, or cycle of rebirth. The regular usage for separation with vinaabhaavaH as contrasted to avinaabhaavaH, the state of being without (anything/or something in association). Thus it is said it is irregular in the sense part and too for etymology. As Aravindji pointed out, "punarbhava" means re-birth. Further, ***vinaa***an indedclinable, unlike punaH, requires the noun with it is related in the syntax take instrumental case (तृतीया, द्वितीया or पञ्चमी) which is absent in this case of Subhashita to relate with it. Even in the case of रामायण, the word is considered as irregular formation or archaic in its usage in the intended meaning as the commentators too strive to derive the meaning "separation".

  

Now coming to the subhAshita, the syntax and meaning is clearly to emphasis of temporal nature of relations with each other in this world.



yatha kaashtam cha kaashtam cha

samaayetaam mahodadhau /

sametya cha vyapaayetaam

kaalamaasadya kanchana //



Like two logs meet each other in the great ocean and move away after a point of time has come (this is not literal translation),

  

evam bhaaryaascha putraascha

jnatayascha dhanaani cha /

sametya vyavadhaavanti

dhruvo hyeshaam vinaabhavah //

  

wives, children, kins and wealth disperse away (in the same way) after they have come into association (for some time). Separation of them (their dispersement) is unavoidable indeed.  

  

In short, the association of wives, children and kins is only accidental and at any time they can be dispersed (which is fixed, but unforseen) (like the two longs in the first verse).

  

Hope this makes some enlightenment of the verse, though a word to word translation.
