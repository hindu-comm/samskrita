श्लोके षष्ठं गुरु ज्ञेयं सर्वत्र लघु पञ्चमम्।

द्विचतुः पादयोर्हस्वं सपतमं दीर्घमन्ययोः॥

  

इति नियमात् छन्दो ऽनुसारेण प्रशंसन्ति/प्रशंसन्तः only would be fitting metrically as the syllable स is the seventh one in the 3rd paada will become ह्रस्व make it defective.

  

According to grammar, both are possible. परस्परं प्रशंसन्ति (They is the implied agent of the verb) and परस्परं is the explicit object and has nothing to do with the verb. There seems nothing objectionable in grammar as the implied agent is they, or if you want explicit agent, परस्परे. or you can simply make परस्परं as adverb well without any complication, गर्दभाश्च उष्ट्राश्च परस्परं प्रशंसन्ति would be very much acceptable formation. Whereas गर्दभश्च उष्ट्रश्च प्रशंसतः, प्रशंसति would be fitting. in exceptional usages. I don't see any objection on grammatical grounds.
