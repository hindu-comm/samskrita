Sir, my question is not about the metrical aptness of प्रशंसन्ति or प्रशंसंत:\| My doubt is about the grammatical correctness. Since we are referring to camels and donkeys in the plural, should it be प्रशंसन्ति, or since we are using parasparam, should we take them as two groups and hence use the dvivacana form - प्रशंसंत:  
  
I hope the question is clear? I probably should have elaborated in the previous mail.
