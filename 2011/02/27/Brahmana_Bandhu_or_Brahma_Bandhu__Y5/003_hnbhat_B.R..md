The same episode retold in Bhagavata Purana 1.7.  
  

prāhārjunaṃ prakupito bhagavān ambujekṣaṇaḥ // (34.2)  
mainaṃ pārthārhasi trātuṃ brahmabandhum imaṃ jahi / (35.1)  
yo 'sāv anāgasaḥ suptān avadhīn niśi bālakān // (35.2)  
  

The above are the lines exactly corresponding to the one quoted by you as available in Bhagavata PuraNa and I could not find the corresponding lines in Mahabharata.

  

These are two other usages of the word in the same chapter:

  

BhāgavPur, 1, 7, 16.1  
tadā śucaste pramṛjāmi bhadreyadbrahmabandhoḥśira ātatāyinaḥ  

  

BhāgavPur, 1, 7, 53.

brahmabandhur na hantavya ātatāyī vadhārhaṇaḥ / (53.c-d)

  

The six types of brahmins labelled as brahmabandhu-s according to Kurma Purana:2.21:(30)

  

śūdrapreṣyo bhṛto rājño vṛṣalo grāmayājakaḥ / 

badhabandhopajīvī ca ṣaḍ ete brahma-bandhavaḥ // (30)

  

Hope this makes more clear the connotation of the compound word brahma-bandhu.
