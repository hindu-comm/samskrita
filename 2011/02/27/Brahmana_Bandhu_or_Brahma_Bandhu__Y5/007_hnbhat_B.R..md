Thank you for your compliments.  

  

I had chanced to visit your language resources, a very useful tool for reference in grammar. I was thinking of writing to you personally to thank you for the website. I really liked it.

  



> Similarly, raaja-bandhu has a similar connotation. One who goes around > telling people that the country's raja (king) is his relative - even > though the king never cares about him :-)

I am afraid there is not a such compound noted in lexicons as raaja-bandhu. Instead, it may be a relative of the king, raaja-shyaala, who is depicted as a comedian/villian idiot character in Sanskrit plays.

  

मदमूर्खताभिमानी दुष्कुलतैश्वर्यसंयुक्तः । सो ऽयमनूढाभ्राता*राज्ञः श्यालः*शकार इत्युक्तः ।। साद-३.४४\|\|

  



> Another major blunder that people commit is w.r.t the word "sabhikaH" > which means a gambler, when they want to say 'sabhyaH' which means > participant of a sabhaa.  
>   



This very familiar to those who are in touch with sanskrit lexicons:

  
सभिका द्यूतकारकाः( २. ८. 44)  

  

The word is not used for the gamblers, but for the people who run the gambling houses. The context is of gambling. Synonyms for gamblers is given in the first half of the verse (44a-b) separately.

  

धूर्तोऽक्षदेवी कितवोऽक्षधूर्तो द्यूतकृत् समाः  

  

By the way, the word धूर्त is primarily used for the gambler exclusively in spite of its general villian, cheat, rogue etc. who use to gamble in the cassino-s. धुर्वति = हिनस्ति इति धूर्तः

  

And sureties provider is called as प्रतिभूः and लग्नकः

  
"स्युर्लग्नकाः प्रतिभुवः"  

  

The wretched position of a gambler is described in the AkshaSukta very beautifully in the form of a soliloquy of a gambler a lamentation over his pitiable condition and leaves a message for others:

  

> अक्षैर्मा दीव्यः कृषिमित् कृषस्व,वित्ते रमस्व बहु मन्यमानः।

> तत्र गावः कितव तत्र जाया,तन्मे विचष्टे सवितायमर्यः।।(ऋ. 10।34।13)।)

>   

> 13 Play not with dice: no, cultivate thy corn-land. Enjoy the gain, > and deem that wealth sufficient.

> There are thy cattle there thy wife, O gambler. So this good Savitar > himself hath told me.

  

Both Sanskrit and English versions can be viewed for the complete hymn called अक्षसूक्त:
