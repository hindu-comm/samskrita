It is a great fortune to have so many well-read persons on this mailing list.  
I'm so happy.  
  
What Sahasraavadhaani madugula nagaphani sarma of Andhra told in his Bhaagavata pravachanam is that it is used to denote a person who goes around telling people that he's a relative of brahmanas so his own stature will improve in the eyes of others.  
  
Similarly, raaja-bandhu has a similar connotation. One who goes around telling people that the country's raja (king) is his relative - even though the king never cares about him :-)  
  
Another major blunder that people commit is w.r.t the word "sabhikaH" which means a gambler, when they want to say 'sabhyaH' which means participant of a sabhaa.  
  
These two are perfect examples to show that language and culture are so intertwined, and one cannot learn a language by simply referring to the dictionary and interpolating.  
- Sai.
