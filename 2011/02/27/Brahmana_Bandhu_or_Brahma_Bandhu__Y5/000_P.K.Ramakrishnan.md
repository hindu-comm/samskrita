A Brahmin association is sending messages addressing members as Brahmana Bandhu  
or Brahma Bandhu.

Though Bandhu is generally used as a good word denoting relationship, if it is  
applied to the word Brahmana or Brahma it has an opposite meaning.

Apte’s dictionary gives the meaning of Brahmabandhu as – a contemptuous term for  
a Brahamana, an unworthy Brahmana, one who is a Brahmana only by caste, a  
nominal  
Brahmana.  
Here is an incident in Mahabharatha.

After binding Aswatthama, Arjuna wants to take him to the militaty camp. Sri  
Krishna spoke to angry Arjuna – You should not show mercy by releasing this  
relative of a Brahmana (brahma-bandhu),for he has killed innocent boys in their  
sleep.
