कृषिधातुणकाराभ्यां सत्तानन्दात्मकतामभिलपत्।

जगदघकार्षित्वां वा कथयदृषिः कृष्णनाम ते व्यतारीत्॥

  

  

  

"कृष विलेखने" to attract, pull, plogh etc. "कृषेर्वर्णे" (उणादिः ३.१) without regard to the verbal meaning, the word कृष्ण is derived literarily, to mean black from the same root. In its literal meaning. Thus the meaning of कृष्ण is defended in Bhagavata when it means Lord Krishna because of colour:

  

आसन् वर्णास्त्रयो ऽस्य गृह्णतोऽनुयुगं तनूः।

शुक्लॊ रक्तस्तथा पीत इदानीं कृष्णतां गतः॥

  

Now, your doubt has been cleared I hope as it is derived without regard to the meaning of the root, transferred its meaning by its usage to mean black.

  

Now, further it can be taken even when it is not used in the sense explained above, strictly following the verbal meaning literally. But the verb can take different shades of meaning. Here is another derivation, not strictly following grammar, but theological consideration:

  

कृषिर्भूवाचकः शब्दो णश्च निर्वृतिवाचकः।

तयोश्चैक्यं परं ब्रह्म कृष्ण इत्यभिधीयते॥

  

The root कृष् means to be, Being , combined with the suffix Na = Bliss, makes the word कृष्ण to mean परं ब्रह्म = The Supreme Being endowed with eternal bliss. This is the PauraNika-s defifition.

  

And, with the literal meaning restored again, with the name कृष्ण based on Puranic legends:

  

कर्षति सर्वान् स्वकुक्षौ प्रलयकाले इति कृष्णः।

कर्षति अरीन् स्वप्रभावशक्त्या, 

कर्षति = आत्मसात् करोति आनन्दत्वेन परिणामयति मनो भक्तानाम् इति वा।

  

He attracts in his own stomach all the creation (withdrawn into his own body from which they were created at the beginning of creation in each Yuga) or

attracts = exacts the enemies with his power,

attracts = into himself (the Supreme Bliss) the mind of his devotees, = कृष्णः।

  

शृण्वतां स्वकथां कृष्णः पुण्यश्रवणकीर्तनः।

हृद्यन्तःस्थो ह्यभद्राणि विधुनोति सुहृत् सताम्॥

  

Krishna, whose story is auspicious to listen, resides in the mind of his beloved devotees by listening to his story and thwarts away any impurity there (and chases away any calamity from coming near the devotees).  
  

In this case, कर्षति पापान्, अभद्राणि वा इति कृष्णः।

  

This much I can offer, right now. If I can come across any more, I will come back with more details.
