This is in continuation of my previous post.

  

One more thing I left to add in it. It is the same root derived differently to give two different meaning. The normal past participle of कृष् will be only कृष्ट which will never mean black. But the other word कृष्ण derived from the same, with different inflection of the same suffix, (which is irregular in Paninian standards recorded) is derived with the supplementary grammar rules provided by Shakatayana, (the group of suffixes called uNAdi) just approved as they are offered but without regard to primary meaning of the verbs. Paninian standard considers them as underived words, and only for the sake of offering etymology the suffixes are used according to the need of the meaning to be derived and guessing the verb accordingly (even though they are not listed in Paninian standards or related in meaning directly with them). Theologians make use of this kind of derivations conveniently to suit their explanations as in the case of the word कृष्ण when it is used to denote the hero of the epic कृष्ण in Bhagavata and other PuraNa-s. This has already been explained by me in my first post. So it is easy to ascribe derivation to the convenient verb कृष् = closer to its form inflected - कृष्ण (when meaning black colour). in other senses, the normal participle forms are to be used. But the other developments are added to explore the divine attributes of कृष्ण the legendary hero and divine personality.
