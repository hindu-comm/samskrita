Murtiji,

दक्षिणा, of course, has nothing to do with रमणा. According to the  
Dictionary of Old Marathi by Tulpule and Feldhaus, रमण means joy or  
happiness. The receiving of दक्षिणा having been perceived as an  
occasion of happiness, the happy gathering of the recipients of  
दक्षिणा must have got this apt nomenclature.
