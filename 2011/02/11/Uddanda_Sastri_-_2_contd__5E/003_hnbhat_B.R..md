Uddanda Shastri (15th century) was born in Tamil Nadu, but  
migrated to Kerala after attaining a mastery of Sanskrit grammar and  
literature. Once in Kerala, he wrote some great poetic masterpieces like  
the "Kokilasandesha" and the "Mallikamaruta" .  
  

But he was known for scholarship in Shastra-s. Both the poetic works are published. There may be more unpublished works in manuscripts. No contribution to Grammar is known.
