I would like to add that it is not the flaring up against a statement of Uddandakavi, and its interpretation that will add to the dignity of this forum.

  

Mr. Ramakrishnan, only quoted the verse attributed to Uddanda Kavi/Pandita (both in a rare composition with varying degree from these both scholars, and poets) by legends handed down through Malayalam population. Without understanding the background in which such a verse was attributed to him, simply arraying insignificant questions about the interpretation is not at all fitting to the spirit of the forum too. Here is the background of Uddanda Kavi, a poet of high genre and scholar too, who shared the court of Zamorin of Calicut with other 17 plus half = 18 and a half making the eighteenth one in his court. So if he mentions bhaasHaa-kavi-s, bhaasha- would naturally mean vernacular language in his contemporary circle, which is obviously the court of Zamorin of Calicut which is in Kerala would never mean any other language than Malayalam, either Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati as you enumerate (which are never present in South India's history).: This is in reply to Vimalaji's querry of the background, which is justified rightly. Here is the link for information and please read it and come on with your interpretation.

Just I was waiting Ramakrishnan's reply though I was willing to do so earlier. It is not only Ramakrishnan that has quoted the verse, but the arrogance of Uddanda Kavi is quoted in a tamil brahmin's forum too where the other verse given by Ramakrishnan in his first post:

Better you can refer to a history of Classical poetry of Sanskrit or a History of Kerala Literature (both Malayalam and Sanskrit, and not Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Oriyan or Kashmiri languages as you have imagined). In kerala, *BhAsha**would naturally mean Malayalam*in the classical period. You cannot blame Ramakrishnan for it.

  

There are many more legends about this legendary poet scholar, which Ramakrishnan knows and myself had the chance to know. But with the welcome speech, it doesn't seem worthy of sharing our knowledge (rather experience) with members flaring up against anything posted imagining something about anything or nothing without trying to understand the spirit.

  

I would seek the opinion of other members too, who had enjoyed such postings earlier on this point.
