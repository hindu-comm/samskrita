Namaste mahodyAH,

I am doing some research on sandesha kavyas at present (please see my recent post on this: <http://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/sandesha-kavyas-sanskrit-messenger-poems/>) and would be interested to learn more about Uddanda Shastri and his kokila sandesha, which I understand is set in Kerala.

Could anyone direct to the text and/or any studies on this work? I am also interested in other sandesha kavyas, set in southern India particularly, and would be grateful for any more information you might have.

Thank you

Venetia
