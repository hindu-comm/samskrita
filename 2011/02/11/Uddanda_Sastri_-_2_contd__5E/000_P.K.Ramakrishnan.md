A learned member of the group has contested myinterpretation that the meaning of bhaashaakavi in

Uddanda Sastri's sloka is not correct. 

  

In the list of Sahitya Academy Winners for Malayalam, I find the first name - R.Narayana Panikkar for his book Bhasha Sahitya Charitam.



Here in the title used there is only Bhasha. It does not say Malayala Bhasha,but it means Malayalam. Bhasha may mean any language. It has to be explained with reference to the context. This book does not mention Sanskrit works like Narayaneeyam or the works of Sankaracharya.



Likewise when Uddanda Sastri mentions bhaashaakavi, he refers to only Malayalam poets who compose in Malayalam language and Malayalam meters.



Sorry for continuing the discussion.
