Many years ago, when Morarji Deasi was Deputy Prime Minister of India, in a public speech at Dehra Dun he stated that Indians while meeting each other should not shake hands; but should only fold and raise their hands and say namaste. This was a news item in Hindustan Times, New Delhi.



Then I wrote to that paper that shaking hands was also a custom in ancient India. In support of this, I quoted the following verse from Valmiki Ramayana. These were the words of Sugriva addressed to Rama.



रोचते यदि मे सख्यं

बाहुरेष प्रसारितः /

गृह्यतां पाणिना पाणिः

मर्यादा बध्यतां त्वया //



If you desire my friendship I am extending this hand. Let the hand be held by hand. You enter into an agreement.



I then sent a cutting of this from the Newspaper to Hon. Morarji Deasai. He replied to me without answering the point stating that I should have written to him, but not to the Newspaper.



I think shaking hands is between equals. One should join hands and say namaste only to those who are superior; vayovriddhas, (elder in age), jnaanavriddhas (elder in knowledge) and tapovriddhas (elder in tapas).
