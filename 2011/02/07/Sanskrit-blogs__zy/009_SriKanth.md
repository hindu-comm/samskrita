Me and few friends are running this website <http://www.sangatham.com> -  
a tamil website for Sanskrit. We plan to write articles, teaching  
materials about sanskrit for tamil audience.  
  
Even if you don't know tamil, we have aggregated various links to  
various blogs, resources which might be useful.
