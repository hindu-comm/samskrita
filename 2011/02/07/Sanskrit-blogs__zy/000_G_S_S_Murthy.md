Dear all,  
I have started posting an occasional blog in Sanskrit at

<http://murthygss.tripod.com/sanskrit/>

I welcome all to have a look at my blogs. There would be many within or beyond this group who write Sanskrit blogs. It would indeed be nice if there could be a directory of Sanskrit blog-sites or references are provided by each blog-site to other blog sites. I seek cooperation and suggestions in this matter.  
Regards  
Murthy
