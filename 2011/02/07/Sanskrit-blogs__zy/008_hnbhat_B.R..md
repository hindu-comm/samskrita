Here is a Sandhi PrakaraNa of Siddhantakaumudi with audio and pdf files:

  

SiddhantaKaumudi online

  

Try this. If not, there is Apte's Guide to Composition also available online.

Anyhow there are too many links dealing with Sandhi. I had seen one link having pps of Siddhantakaumudi too. (which is a complete text dealing with Paninian rules)

  

Thanks for all providing the links.
