It is reported in the TV channels and newspapers that our representative in the United Nations, Hon.S.M.Krishna read out the wrong opening speech after getting a seat in the assembly for the next two years.The main opposition party in India, the BJP, has commented that he has reached the maximum level ofincompetency. He himself is the Minister of External Affairs and the rank is above that of an Ambassador.

  

I have just taken out from Ramayana what the qualifications of an ambassador should be. Hanuman

introduces himself that he is a messenger/ambassador of Sugriva. Then Rama speaks to Lakshmana giving an appraisal ofHanuman in the following words.

  

नूनं व्याकरणं क्रित्स्नं अनेन बहुधा श्रुतम् /

बहु व्याहरतानेन न किंचिदपभाषितम् //

अविस्तरं असन्दिग्धं अविलम्बितं अद्रुतम् /

उरस्थं कन्ठगं वाक्यं वर्तते मध्यमे स्वरे //

उच्चारयति कल्याणीं वाचं हृदयदारिणीम् /

कस्य नाराध्यते चित्त्तमुद्यतासेररेरपि //

एवं विधो यस्य दूतो न भवेत् पार्थिवस्य तु /

सिध्यन्ति हि कथं तस्य कार्याणां गतयोनघ //



Surely all grammar has been heard by him.

Even when he spoke a lot, there has been no

mistake in his speech.

Not elaborate. Without any ambiguity. Not slow. Nor fast.

From the heart through the neck in a middle tone.

He speaks beutiful words touching one's heart.

Whose mind is not happy, even that of an enemy with raised sword.

If one does not have a messenger (ambassador) like this, how can

a king achieve results.
