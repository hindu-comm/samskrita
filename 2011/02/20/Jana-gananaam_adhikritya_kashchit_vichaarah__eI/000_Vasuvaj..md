----------  
This mail is regarding the census.  
There was lot of discussion on this topic.  
  
I request you all to kindly read the page in the following link:

Most people might not be able to write "Sanskrit" as answer to Question 10.  
  
 BUT  
  
 Most of the people in this group and many many others in the country can write "Sanskrit" as answer to Question 11.  
  
----------------  
  
 Numbers matter in democracy ....... especially in India.  
  
The country was partitioned based on numbers. Infact cities like Lahore and Chittagong should have been in India, but due to some carelessness of some leaders of the previous generation, those places have become alien lands.  
  
Be it in the labour union or students union or even in political parties,  
giving inflated numbers is the norm.  
  
Nowadays reality TV shows have become very popular in many provinces of India. After each performance by some participant, the audience are requested to vote by sending an sms. I was taken aback, when I saw
banners and posters displayed publicly in a village near my hometown, asking people to vote for a certain participant as he belonged to their particular community. They never bother about the merit of the participants. What is more important is to which social group the participant belongs.  
  
 There are many 'superstars' in the film world. It is a well-known fact that a film of a particular actor will run to packed houses in some particular towns where the people belonging to that actor's community reside in huge numbers.  
  
 I also know of some villages where the people have been speaking a  
particular language for the past so many generations. But in the last census , they gave their language as something else which was totally alien to the land  
  
 If there is more numbers, then more funds are allocated for the development of the language ; there will be provisions made to teach that language in the schools ; more teachers are appointed; etc...  
  
 And if the numbers are small, the funds allotted is small, teaching of that language in schools is some times done away with etc.....  
  
This is the ground reality.  
  
Hence I request all the Sanskrit knowing people to declare Sanskrit as the  answer to Question 10  
  
  
Aapatkaala dharmah -:)  
  
  
 ASHVATTHAAMA HATAH .  Hatah kunjarah.  
  
  
  
 But if you feel yourselves to be more truthful than Yudhishtirah, then  
 atleast declare Sanskrit as the first answer to Question 11.
