It was with great interest and awe that I read your description of you visit to Kerala pradesh.

I am glad to state that I learnt a great deal and enjoyed the writing.



I have a question, about the use of a word "tathaa". In your wrinting you used it to mean "and".

I think this word means "like that" or "such that". I think the samrit term for "and" is "uta".



Please clarify the use of the term "tathaa" and teach me.

I shall be greatful.
