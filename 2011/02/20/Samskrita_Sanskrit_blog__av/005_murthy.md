Thanks for the trouble you have taken in reading my blog and giving me useful feedback. Generally तथा is used along with च, in which case it provides emphasis. At one place I have used it without च. I find that in Apte's dictionary for entry तथा, one of the meanings given is "as also" "so also". I believe I have come across in Sanskrit texts use of तथा to mean च although I cannot off-hand quote. Perhapsthis groupcould throw more light.

Thanks once again,

Regards

Murthy
