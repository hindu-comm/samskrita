**Subject:** Duronto Express  
  

I find in todays newspaper that a new train has been introduced from Bangalore to New Delhi named

DURONTO EXPRESS.  The spelling duronto is Bengali spelling for duranta.
duranta as per Apte's

dictionary means - unhappy ending. The Railway Minister has selected this word mistaking it for

turanta meaning fast. The Sanskrit word for horse is turaga meaning going fast.

  

I suggest the Railway Minister to rename the train properly.
