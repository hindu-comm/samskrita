टीका टूकामपेक्षते /

Apte's dictionary gives the meaning of teekaa like this:



काव्यप्रकाशस्य कृतौ गृहे गृहे

टीका कृताप्येष तथैव दुर्गम: /



In every house there is an explanatory

work called teekaa for explaining the meaning

of poetry. Even then it is difficult to understand

the meaning.



I have heard a saying in this connection.

टीका टूकामपेक्षते /

One requires a tuukaa to understand a teekaa.
