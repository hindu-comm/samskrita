अजायुद्धं ऋषिश्राद्धं

प्रभाते मेघडम्बरम् /

दम्पत्यॊ: कलह्श्चैव

परिणामे न किंचन //



Meaning:

The fight between two she-goats,

the sraadha ceremony of rishis,

amassing of clouds in the early morning,

quarrel between husband and wife -

at the end it will end in nothing.



Explanation:



Goats sometimes fight each other. Probably

the she goats fight more often. They have

only bare heads without horn. They stand

opposite each other at great distance and

try to hit each other. But before hitting

they stop. Again this type of fighting continues

for several rounds. And they withdraw.



When Rishis perform annual sraadha ceremony

for their departed, they do samkalpam for hours.

But the actual ceremony lasts only a few minutes.



When there is a large gathering of clouds with

thunder in the morning, one can be sure that there

would be no rain.



When a husband and wife start quarrelling,

it would seem that instead of a war of words,

it might result in blows. After some time it

will all be nothing.
