He was the person who declared Ramana as Ramana Maharshi. He was a great poet because of which

he was called kaavyakantam.

  

There was a contemporary of his in Calcutta called Ambaadutta. He was a bit arrogant. Ganapathi Sastri

once went to see him and know his greatness.

  

When he first met him heintroducedhimself as Ambaaduttah. Ganapati Sastri introduced himself thus -

Bhavaan Ambaayaah Dattaputrah. Aham tu Ambaayaah aurasaputrah. (Ambaa means Parvati.)

  

Duttaputra means adopted son. Aurasaputra means own son.

  

It is said that Ambaadutta readilyacknowledged his lower status.
