Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,



This may interest you, in connection with the shloka sent by you



दत्तस्तन्यरसं कराग्रिमभुवा वक्त्रान्तरेष्वादरा-  
द्दोर्विक्षेपनिषिद्धकुम्भविरचन्मत्तद्विरेफोत्करम् ।  
अम्बाया धयतो पयोधरयुगं तिर्यग्मिथः पश्यतो-  
र्बाल्यस्नेहविजृम्भितं विजयते द्वैमातुरस्कन्दयोः ।।



This is the invocatory stanza from alankarakaustubha of shri vishveshwara pandita  
  
This depicts sibling love between Skanda and Ganesha, wherein, while skanda isbeing breastfed by Parvati,the other five mouths of skanda are (dejected and) are helped feeding byGanesha with his trunk, while skanda with his multiple armsis warding off the swarms of black bees hovering around the temple of ganesha attracted by the smell of the rut on his temple
