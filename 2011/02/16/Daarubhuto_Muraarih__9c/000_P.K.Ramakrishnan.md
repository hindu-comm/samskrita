### Daarubhuuto Muraarih.

Muraari was a nimisha-kavi in Sanskrit Language.

When he was a student, one day his guru noticed

his absence. He asked a fellow student to go and

fetch him from the hostel. When he went to the

hostel he found Muraari fast asleep. He reported the

matter to the Guru saying Daarubhuuto Muraarih.

The Guru asked him to wake him up and bring to

the class.



When Muraari was thus brought to the class,

the Guru asked him – Daarubhuuto Muraarih?



Then Muraari replied with the following verse:



ekaa bharyaa prakrutirachalaa, chanchalaa cha dvitiiyaa,

putronangah thribhuvanajayii manmatho durnivaarah /

seshassayaa, vastirudakam,vaahanam pannagaarih.

smaaram smaaram svagrihacharitam daarubhuuto muraarih //



एका भार्या प्रकृतिरचला चंचला च द्वितीया

पुत्रॊनंगस्त्रिभुवनजयी मन्मथो दुर्निवार: /

शॆष: शय्या वसतिरुदकं वाहनं पन्नगारि:

स्मारं स्मारं स्वगृह्चरितं दारुभूतो मुरारि: //



One wife is Bhumi which will not move.

The other wife (lakshmi) will always move

from one place to another.

The son is without a body conquering the

three worlds and difficult to be controlled.

His bed is the serpent Sesha. His abode is

the ocean. His vehicle is Garuda the enemy

of the serpent.

Thinking and thinking of his family problems

Murari became a log.
