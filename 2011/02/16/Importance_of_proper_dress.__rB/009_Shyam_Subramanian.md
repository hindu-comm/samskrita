Dear P.K.Ramakrishan,  
  
Siva is called digambara in the Siva pancAkshara stotra ("nAgendra hAraya...") and in one version of the SivAshtaka ("tasmai namaH..").  
He is also called digvAsaH (=digambara according to Monier-Williams) in the Siva sahasranAma stotra in the mahAbhArata.  
  
Regards,  
Shyam
