किं वाससा तत्र विचारणीयम्

वास: प्रधानं खलु योग्यताया: /

पीतांबरं वीक्ष्य ददौ स्वकन्याम्

चर्माम्बरं वीक्ष्य विषं समुद्र: //



What is there to think about dress?

Dress is very important for personality.

The ocean gave his daughter Lakshmi

to Vishnu because he was wearing

a yelleow dress.

When poison (halahalam) came out on

churning he offered that to Siva as he

was wearing an animal skin.
