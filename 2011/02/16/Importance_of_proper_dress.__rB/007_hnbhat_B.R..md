Here is the popular Panchakshara stotra:

  

भास्मंगारागाया महेश्वराय नित्याय शुद्धाय*दिगम्बराय*तस्मै नकाराय नमः शिवाय  
  

better than any dictionary. And the story behind was that He fell his Linga, when he wandered in Daruvana naked, he attracted the wives of the sages there and knowing this they cursed that his Linga fall to the ground. There is such a story behind it.

  

Anyhow it is an epithet of Shiva, is confirmed which is by pun can well fit to the occasion. Like पीताम्बर means Vishnu, दिगम्बर means only shiva in this context. and none others wearing yellow cloth or without cloth. By pun it is use to suit the context as wearing yello silk cloth and with a cloth to cover his body (so poor). And the context supports both. Vemon कालकूट was accepted by Shiva and लक्ष्मी was given to Vishnu. It is well fitting to the context and in the cases of Yamaka and other शब्दालंकार-s much inquiry is not itself fitting than what is required to appreciate the imagination behind it.
