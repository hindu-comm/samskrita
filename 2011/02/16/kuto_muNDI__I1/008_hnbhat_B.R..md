In so far as Arvindji's query is concerned is satisfied based on the information supplied in the biography of SriSankara, it is mostly irrelevant to debate on the native place of Sankara or Mandana Mishra. The episode is attested by Sankaravijaya reference by Mr.Sunder and undue elongation of the debate on irrelevant points may not be of common interest. In anyway, it doesn't make any difference in the episode mentioned in Sankaradigvijaya or its relevance to the issue raised by Mr.Arvindji.

  

Thanks Sundar for the precise references and all who participated in this debate. I think a pdf version of Sankaradigvijaya should be available somewhere on the net. I am not sure.
