Dear Group,  
  
I wish to go back to Vimalaji’s first question at the top and say the  
following.  
  
The very absence of any original name for what is today commonly  
called as the ‘Hindu religion’ means that it never was a ‘religion’ in  
the sense Christianity, Islam are religions.  
I would say that anyone, however born and brought-up, who wishes to  
live in a way other ‘Hindus’ live should be considered a ‘Hindu’ by  
other Hindus and should have all rights of other Hindus, such as the  
ability to enter a temple and offer worship, with only reasonable  
restrictions as to appearance, behaviour and clothing. No approval by  
priests and gurus or no purification should be a pre-condition for any  
person to lead his life as a Hindu, if he so wants.  
  
I would go one step further and say that there should not be any  
restriction on the entry by non-Hindus into temples, the only  
condition being the observance of proper decorum.
