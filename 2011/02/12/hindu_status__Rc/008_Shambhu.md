Vimala ji, a bit more addendum:  
  
In the West, the “Guru” word may take our mind to the “new age” or  
yoga gurus; most of them may not know this subject. Those learned  
among them may give some pointers. A way to approach this may be to  
ask a Hindu temple archaka or purOhita for further guidance.  
  
Many traditionalists in India may discourage the seeker all together  
(quoting ‘svaDharmE niDhanam shrEyaH’, etc.) but I know of paNditas  
and purOhitas who have performed such ‘becoming Hindu’ procedures (or  
giving dwija dIkSha to a shUdra). The precise details have to be  
worked out between the “guru” and the seeker. There is no ready-made,  
one-jacket-fits-all procedure. The seeker has to search a bit since  
Hindus don’t really encourage “conversion” unless the seeker’s intent  
and mental inclinations are fully understood.  
  
ISKON has a procedure similar to that of the Himalayan Academy. It is  
essentially brAhmiNIkaraNa and, if desired, sanyAs.
