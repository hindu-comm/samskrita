It is well established that Hindu is derived from Sindhu, not by Indians  
but foreigners, by Arabians/Persians and adopted by Britishers.

  
My question is about usage of Sa and Ha.  
In Avestan literature, river Saraswati is referred as Harahvaiti.  
In colloquial Gujarati, Sa gets replaced with Ha, Ha spoken softly(like  
H is English Hi! rather than H in Sanskrit Hriday).

Has this Sa/Ha replacement PIE origin or is it Metathesis?

Do other languages have this kind of replacement?
