Arvind Mahodaya  
Thanks very much for your very sensible response which I thoroughly agree  
with. There is no need for going to great lengths to "prove" anything.  
Hinduism does not have a council which has gone through all the voluminous  
religious literature deciding what is a core belief or what can be dispensed  
with. So each person can decide to live the way they interpret things for  
themselves and to be true to their own beliefs, regardsless of what they  
are.
