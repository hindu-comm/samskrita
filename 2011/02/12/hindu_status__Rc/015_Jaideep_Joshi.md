Traditionally, the word Hindu has been used to denote anyone living in the land to the east of Sindhu and west of Himalayas. This word was coined by Persian traders, and was not associated with religion until very recently.

  

Orthodox Pandits completely reject the word as applied to religion, and hold on to the word "Sanatana Dharma" as the appropriate word. On the other hand, V. D. Savarkar coined the term "[Hindutva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva)" which has more to do with nationalism and is rather self-referential, in the sense that one who accepts his "Hindu" ancestry, or simply, anyone who calls himself so, is a Hindu!

  

A google search would probably show a few more definitions!
