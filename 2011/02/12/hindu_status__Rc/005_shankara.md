Arya Samaj has been converting non-Hindus to Vedic Dharma. They do not use the word "Hinduism". Still it is not much different from Hinduism. As far as I know this ritual was started nearly 100 ago to bring back those Hindus who were converted forcibly or by temptation to Islam or Christianity. But, now they are allowing even those who are born in other religions to get converted to "Vedic Dharma".

  

Website of Bangalore centre of Arya Samaj has online application form for those who wish to get converted to "Vedic Dharma". The link is <http://www.aryasamajbangalore.org/SHUDDHI_APPLICATION.pdf>
