Philosophically speaking, even otherwise Hinduism is more a philosophy than a religion as it is *Sanātana Dharma*. Hinduism or even Buddhism is a way of life, there is no parallel to this concept in the west, hence Hinduism is considered wrongly to be a religion, So what rituals can there be to adhere to a philosophy? there can be none. Just my thoughts.
