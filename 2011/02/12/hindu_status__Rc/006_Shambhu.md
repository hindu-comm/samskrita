In these times, many Europeans or Westerners interested in becoming  
Hindus have 'become' Hindus (or, are 'becoming' Hindus) by approaching  
a Guru well versed in any of the Hindu traditions or sampradAyas and  
following his/her guidance. At minimum, the process involves some  
prAyaschitta hOma and the samskAras relevant to the Ashrama being  
sought. This appears to be the "Hindu procedure", if we may term it  
so. This is similar to the ancient ways of adopting and following any  
Hindu sampradAya, as we may surmise from the life stories of Bhagawan  
Buddha, Mahavira, Adi Shankara, Sree Ramanuja, etc. who developed  
their own methods and lineages of new followers. Arya Samaj (in its  
shudDhi procedure) only revised it a bit.  
  
The kind of Ashrama (Brahmin, sanyAs, etc.) the disciple chooses and  
the relevant ritualistic ceremonies are the matters guided (decided)  
by the Guru. In the strictest sense, garBhAdAnadi samskAras are  
performed. In general, for cases involving a non-Hindu marrying a  
Hindu, it is the purOhita who outlines the procedure, if desired by  
the concerned parties. In the present-day Arsha vivAha, any girl who  
had no upanayanam is a "shUdra" and therefore procedure-wise there is  
no difference if the girl is from a Hindu family or not. Some  
padDhatis stipulate all the pre-marriage samskAras for the girl even  
if she had them a priori. It is a kind of fail-safe system.  
  
The Himalayan Academy (Sundar ji pointed out) has devised more or less  
a strict procedure not common in the Hindu sampadAyas. Dr. David  
Frawley (known as Vamadeva Shastri) has written a book on how he  
became a Hindu (How I Became a Hindu: My Discovery of Vedic Dharma by  
David Frawley (Vamadeva Shastri), Voice of India 2001).
