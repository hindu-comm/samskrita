Dear Group,  
  
I would like to know everything about the word ‘Hindu’. We take this  
word for granted and have derived new words like ‘Hindutva’, ‘Hindu-  
Rashtra’, ‘Hindu-Bhumi’, ‘ Hindu-Hridaya-Samrat’ from it.  
  
I would be like to know, if it is possible to give an answer to this  
question, where was this word first used and by whom. Approximately  
how old is this word?
