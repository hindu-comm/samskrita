-   Anyhow I am not interested in the question.

But the issue was raised in another forum and I am forwarding the same for you in my next message.

  

Wittingly, it is according to the needs of the day. I can quote an example of one of my relative a doctor, (whose father, brothers, and relatives are traditional purohit-s for many families). His son migrated to Germany and he came with a German girl friend with his and with all his relative priests, got him converted in Hindu making to wear him sacred thread and then married his daughter following the same ceremonials as if he had married a Brahmin girl from India.

  

यद् यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरे जनाः।

स यत् प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते।

  

गतानुगतिको लोको न लोकः पारमार्थिकः।

  

With regards
