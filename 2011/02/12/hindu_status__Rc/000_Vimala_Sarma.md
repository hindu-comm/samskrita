Dear Scholars

Please advise on the correct procedure for a non-Hindu (European) to go through to become a Hindu and to be accepted as such by others, for example, when visiting temples which bar non-Hindus from entering the inner sanctum.

What is the critical ritual for this? How do other people know whether this has been undertaken or not? This is not mentioned in any of the dharmasAstras. Does this means that Hindu beliefs and practices are only for dvijAs , and not for outsiders?

Given that these days most modern Hindus do not wear the thread etc, is this necessary for a foreign person to do this? What is the norm?
