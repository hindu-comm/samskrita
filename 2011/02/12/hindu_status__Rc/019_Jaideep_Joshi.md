Dear Jay mahodaya,

s>h is an isogloss developed between some Indo-Aryan languages on one  
hand and Iranian language on the other, when they were in close  
geographical contact in contiguous areas. It is not of PIE origin,  
because if it were, it would have manifested in all other IE  
languages.

praNAm,  
Jaideep
