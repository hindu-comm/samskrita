Very beautiful verse.

  

The verse requests the king in his poetic imagination to check his flag, indicator of the splendor of victory (in advance) during his march against the enemiesfrom flying beyond the sky,lest it should frighten the deer in the disc of moon at the sight of the lion in the emblem impressed on the surface it (the flag) making it run away (from the moon) and the disc of moon will be equal to the faces of his queens.

  

The suggestion by the exaggerated imagination is that the face of your queens is more beautiful than the disc moon because it is with spot in the form of deer and their faces spotless and never comparable.

  

There are certain poetic conventions basically agreed by poets. The beautiful face of women is compared either lotus or moon (generally). The spot in the moon is conceived as deer and hare hence his epithet शशलाञ्छनः (marked with hare) or मृगलाञ्छन (marked with deer). Poets make use of this conventional description in many exaggerated imaginations. This is one of such imaginations. which is called उत्प्रेक्षा. Here the figures of speech are interwoven which need little more practice to appreciate them.

  

Though शार्दूल means tiger, it can be lion too.

  

-   a lion (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   a panther (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   a tiger (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988) -   leopard (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)

  

Lion is known मृगेन्द्रः, मृगादनः, commonly known among poets as the enemy of deers हरिणवैरी, हरिणारिः etc. in their descriptions. Here even if it is tiger, in the emblem of zamorins of Calicut (a real fact, which could not be confirmed without historical evidence), by pun it may mean Lion too, at the sight of which the deer (the spot in disc) of moon would run away by which it would become equal to the face of the queens of the king. Earlier, it was inferior to their faces with the spot in it.

  

This is the poetic appreciation part of the verse.
