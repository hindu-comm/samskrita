Thank you for notifying the typo-error. I just missed it.

  

It could be only "हे\[तुः के\]तुरतीत्य सूर्यसरणिं" which I had read ignoring it and translated accordingly in my post.

  

सूर्यसरणिमतीत्य गच्छन् = transcending the sky (the path of the Sun) flying high above the sky is literary meaning. As you have said, it may suggest by the word of केतु, but is is not obvious and helpful for improving upon the imagination totally presented in the verse. 

  

Thanks once again for your response.
