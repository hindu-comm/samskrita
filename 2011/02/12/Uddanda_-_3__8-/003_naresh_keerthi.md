There seems to be some mistake in the text - the second line is missing two syllables -  
  
I suspect you meant to write हेतु: केतुरातित्य in the second line.  
  
Also there seems to be a pun when he says केतुरातित्य सूर्यसरणिं, there may be a pun, in that like the planet केतु looms over the sun, threatening to eclipse him, the flag flies high in the sky.  
  
Best,
