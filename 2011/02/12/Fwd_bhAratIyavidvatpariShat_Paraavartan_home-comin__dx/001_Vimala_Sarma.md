Thank you all for your thoughts on this matter.

In \> \><http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/hbh/hbh_ch-5.html>
the unfortunate (Freudian?) typo occurs – “perverts” for “converts”. In the nine points of beliefs the last (point 9) seems to contradict the first. It is hard to define “essential beliefs” as Upanisadic thoughts are not necessary theistic, and sectarian beliefs including worship at temples developed later. It reactionary to go back and associate Hinduism with caste, since there has been a hard struggle to rid ourselves of some undesirable facets of caste.



Re: the Hindu katham bhUyate - seems to be very bureaucratic and targeted to someone who has had a strong pre-existing faith.
Nevertheless it an interesting attempt to get to a standardised procedure. It seems to place a much higher standard on foreigners than the majority of existing Hindus.



The ceremony for anointment of a king giving him brAhmaNa status is in the Rveda brAhmaNas (ref: AB 4.7. 23) – the rAjasUya.

The vratyaSToma is interesting and if anyone can give me a vedic reference to the original text – I will be most interested.

I should add that I personally have some issues with Manavadharmastra.**



Vimala**
