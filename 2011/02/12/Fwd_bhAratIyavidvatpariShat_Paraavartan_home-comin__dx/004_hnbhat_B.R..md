Dear Vimala Madam,

  

Thanks for the informative links from Sundar.

  

Here are the related pages from Shabdakalpadruma and Vacaspatya, two Sanskrit lexicons (of informative entries). But there are many kinds of Vrata-s running explanations in 5 to 10 pages in Vacaspatya (compiled from different Sanskrit sources on Dharmashastra). Here I got only pages related the word Vratya, already discussed in the web pages in the links, with additional sources from Dharmashastra and "Vratyastoma" a related name of a kind of Yajna probably to be performed by the Vratya's. As per the definitions, who have gone out of "Vraata" communes, or who have defaulted /violated the "Vrata"s prescribed for them, are called Vraatya-s. And different kinds of Prayaschitta's are prescribed according to the degree of deviation from the Vrata-s. This is the idea I got from a first glance to the entries therein the pages.
This is in regard to your recent question.  
  

With regards

î—“
