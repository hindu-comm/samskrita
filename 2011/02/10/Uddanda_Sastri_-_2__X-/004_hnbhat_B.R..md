Promptly replied to Brahmasri Narayanasvamin.

  

I have posted my reply in another thread started by Ramakrishnan to supplement his argument in which I have posted a link to a web page containing the background of the contemporary circle of court poets of Uddanda Kavi.

  

But I fail to understand such a cry against this post by our learned Brahmasri and his motive behind the flaming words of complaining.

  

Anyway, it is the popular verse handed over through legends and no question arises about their authenticity or source. But they represent only the attitude behind them.  
  

Anyway, I don't get the idea behind addressing a community in than this forum in this context. Brahmasri Narayanaswamy is once again reminded that this popular verse denotes his condemn towards the vernacular poets bhashaakavi-s as it explicit in the shloka itself. Better to re-read and come again with a better interpretation for the verse, which had been handed over through the legends related to the great scholar/poet Uddanda-kavi as he is represented in Kerala. And his contempt about N;ambudri brahmins too may be taken from this verse. "praayeNa vruttavihInaaH" by interpreting not having "aacaara" as Uddanda Pandita has learnt them (in Tamilnadu from Tamil Brahmins). The practices of Nambudri community is entirely different from those in Tamilnadu, Andhra and Karnataka. (which had been ridiculed even in modern times, leave alone UddaNDa who was 16th century Brahmin of Tamil origin).

  

Hope you will enjoy the verse in its spirit and better understand its purpose.
