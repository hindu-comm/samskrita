Uddanda Sastri had a very low opinion about the Poets of Malayalam language.

  

Here is what he says.

  

भाषाकविनिवहोयं

दोषाकरवत् विभाति गगनतले /

प्रायेण वृत्तहीनः

सूर्यालोके विनष्टगोप्रसर: //



This multitude of Malayalam Poets

shine like the moon in the sky.

Mostly not round (not composing in proper meters)

losing brightness (losing their verbal display)

at the approach of the sun (in front of learned people).
