Thanks Vimalaji for the explanation.

  

I was still thinking of the possible form in the context and could not find it. If I can find any satisfactory one, I will revert back.

  

Please view the other message recently received from Narayana swamy Iyer addressing dear fellow Iyers. I couldn't understand what the message intends to to with the verse in the original message of Ramakrishnan: which should correctly reads:

  

"यमस्तु हरते प्राणान्" in all available readings.

  

With regards
