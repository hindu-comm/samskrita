Anyhow it is not attested in all the reading. In case, the long I is accepted as the authentic reading, it can be explained in a different way, by either the lengthening is for the metrical purpose using the licence of Vedic usage. Or as you have suggested, it can be explained as the aorist past of av = to protect which would perfectly fit the context without the past tense intended (archaic usage is always flexible). Please reveal to me and protect me by two verbs. I could not confirm the poetential mood form though I too checked with AvI.

  

I too found it is आवीर्मin many pages off the web.instead of आविर्म in spite of its appearance the web. As suggested by LalithaaLaalita, it would be better to accept the archaic usage. एव becomes एवा,and the like. by virture of अन्येषामपि दृश्यते ६.३.१३६, १३७.like पुरुषः, पूरुषः.

  

Recent message from Lalitaalaalita confirms this assumption too.
