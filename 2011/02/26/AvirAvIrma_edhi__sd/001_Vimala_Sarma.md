Dear Girish Mahodaya  
Root is Avis "to appear"  
आविस् ind. (said to be connected with वहिस् and अव ; or fr. आ-विद् BRD), before the eyes , openly , manifestly , evidently RV. AV. VS.  
आवि f(इ and /ई). (perhaps √वी), pain, suffering Sus3r. TS.  
ईर्म ind. or ईर्म्/आ in this place, here, to this place  
Both आविस् and ईर्म are indeclinable, according to MW.

So we get "(you) be manifest in this place of suffering" (meaning "in this world" - I think).  
  
Krishna Mahodaya - "uta" is not normally used in ordinary Sanskrit for "and"; it is a vedic particle.

Re a "crow and beggar" poem "madhye" means in the middle (physical location) and is not the normal way of comparing two things. This is my guess only.  
Vimala
