Harsha was the poet who wrote the Naishadhiyacharitam.  
It was very difficult for people to understand its meaning.  
It is said that he rewrote it several times to make it  
more understandable.  
On one such occasion one of his friends met him  
and asked.  
हर्ष ! किं चिकीर्षसि?  
Harhsha ! What do you want?  
He replied.  
शेमुषीमुषिमाषमुषे /  
I want to eat beans which will reduce my intellect.  
  
There is a saying in Indiathat if one eats more beans  
i.e. udad dal he would become dull.  
  
I hope you will enjoy this piece.
