Dear Tekumalla,

  

I actually wanted to add a note on this ulad dal by mentioning idli.

Idli contains both rice and ulud dal. When we were children we were advised not to eat too much of idli as

it contains ulad dal and that it will make one dull. This advice was not for dosa.

  

Many thanks for bringing out this point.
