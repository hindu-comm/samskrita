Friends,

  

Lately I have seen this quote:

  

avivekaṁ param āpadaṁ padam

  

with this translation:

  

"Lack of discrimination is the source of the greatest danger."

  

(I get both the quote and its translation from Eknath Easwaran's Gita commentary, vol. 3, pg. 234)

  

I am wondering if others have seen this particular saying? and if the source might be known?

  

If not -- as seems likely -- it is also interesting to ponder how it is that so many rich but anonymous phrases came into currency. What might be the process for that?

  

Thanks, warmly,

  

Brian
