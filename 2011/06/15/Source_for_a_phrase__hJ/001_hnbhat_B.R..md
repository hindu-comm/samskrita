सहसा विदधीत न क्रियाम् अविवेकः परमापदां पदम् ।

वृणते हिविमृश्यकारिणं गुण लुब्धाः स्वयमेव हि संपदः ॥(किरातार्जुनीयम् २.३०)

  

Please check the reference in any of the available editions. I got it from a website.

  

Here is a translation too for the portion with parallel quotes from English:

  
One should never act in a hurry. Bad decisions lead to great disasters. Wealth loves good qualities of a person and by itself goes to the one who thinks and acts.  
  
“Haste makes waste”  
“The haste of a fool is the slowest thing in the world”  
“Unreasonable haste is the direct road to error”
