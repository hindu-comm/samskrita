Bhat Sir,

  

Namaste,

  

Thanks a lot for taking time to point out the errors in the [story](http://samskritwisdom.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/wisdom-from-mahakavi-bharavi-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%83-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%AE/). I am a humble student of Sanskrit and not a scholar. I had written those posts only to improve my Sanskrit writing. Some scholars who visited that blog were kind enough to point out errors in the posts. I hope this helped me to some extent.  

  

I have made the corrections as pointed out by you in your mail. Please help me to rewrite the sentence " सा पुत्रमेकं जन्मं दत्तवती". Also, please see if the changes I made are okay. I would like your feedback on other posts too, if you could spare your valuable time.  



regards  
shankara
