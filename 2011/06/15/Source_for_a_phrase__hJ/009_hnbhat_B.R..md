If this is a guess, both are wrong. Otherwise, if any explanation for the alternative reading?

  

I had learnt since my introduction and still remember it as the same. I didn't notice the space crept in in the source I copied it from the web, as I didn't give much importance to it.

  

Here is the commentary:

  

These are the words of Draupadi, counselling YudhiShThita, better to wait till they earn enough power to fight with Kaurava-s, than challenging them all of a sudden in a hurry without proper preparation in the second Sarga, in reply to Bheema's counsel urging to declare war on Duryodhana immediately. The words are very clear and meaningful in themselves even without any commentary which is very finely interwoven into a story. Such stories are profusely composed in respect of many other poets.

  

सहसा विदधीत न क्रियाम्,

  

Don't do any act in a hurry (without thinking over the effects)>

  

अविवेकः परमापदां पदम्।

  

Thoughtlessness is original source of all the disasters (to come).

  

  

गुणलुब्धाः सम्पदः स्वयमेवविमृश्यकारिणं (पुरुषं)वृणते।

  

The riches attracted by the virtues, chose themselves the wise man who thinks before he acts (for their permanent residence) (which are otherwise unstable anywhere).

  

The above is correct in agreement of Gender and verb according to Sanskrit Grammar as I know. Since सम्पदः the agent of the verb is in plural, वृणते is also the plural and cannot be वृणुते in singular.

  

Any support for the other suggestion from both the members?

  

=========

The interesting story composed with the piece of this verse is fine. But the composition itself poses many such dilemma's:

  

। प्रायः विदुषाः निर्धनाः सन्ति।

अतः सः उपरोक्तश्लोकस्य

I could not find such a word in Sanskrit.

पूर्वार्धं पत्नीं दत्वा

Did he gave wife and the half or wife herself the earlier half?

  

एकां वणिक्पत्नीं दत्वा

Here again she gives another wife of a merchant together with half verse.?

  

। तस्या पति यः व्यापार्यार्थं(?)

  

सा पुत्रमेकं जन्मं दत्तवती (?)

Is this a direct translation from English: She gave birth to a son?

  

कविः झटित्या तं

I didn't knowझटिति can be a feminine word.

  

Anyhow thanks for the interesting story.
