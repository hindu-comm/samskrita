Dear Kirti,

  

Please don't worry about it. Many members do the same thing in a urge to reply. "महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः"

  

The discussion had arrived to the question of the acceptability reading highlighted in your message above as I had pointed out in my earlier message.

  

Even though I too found in many sites, the same reading, I think it doesn't agree with the agent of the main predication of the second half in plural सम्पदः as obviously the verbal form वृणुते is in singular. There is no other singular agent in the second half to be related to the verb, and no other verb to be related to विमृश्यकारिणं as its object. It could be related to अविवेकः as a बहुव्रीहि compound with a sentence, अविवेकः परमापदां पदं वृणुते "Thoughtless man reaches in the end full of disasters" which doesn't seem to be pleasing and even in that case, it has to take विमृश्यकारी to contrast with अविवेकः in the first half. But it is in accusative, and the contrast becomes incompatible. Even then, it has to be changed into plural again, as वृण्वते to be related to be retaken with सम्पदः as its subject and विमृश्यकारिणं as the object. Instead,

  

वृणते the popular reading is simple and better in the context and supported by the commentaries of Mallinatha etc.
