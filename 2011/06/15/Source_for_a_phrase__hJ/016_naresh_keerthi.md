Dr. Bhat,  
  
I agree with your analysis - vRNatE seems to be the correct reading in this context - supported by both grammatical insights(yours) and the textual tradition(mallinAtha's).  
  
It is ironical, that I have been dashing off a reply, while ignoring the very advice of the verse we are discussing - sahasA vidadhIta na kriyAM! Thanks for your gracious reply.  
  
I will have to learn to be more of a vimRSyakArin!  
  
  
PKR-ji,  
  
guna-lubdhAH sampadaH - prosperity, that is attracted to(literally greedy for) virtue.  
  
sampadaH - sriyaH - fortune/ riches  
  
guNa-lubdhAh - guNa-pakSapAtinaH - interested in/ greedy for virtues/ guNas.  
  
Best,  
  
Naresh Keerthi
