I do not recollect where I got these. They have been in my memory for  
several decades.  
  
There is yet one more that I cannot recollect, except that it is about  
a verse in गीता and it turns on the word मोहित in it. Can you say  
which verses of गीता have मोहित in them and maybe it will surface.
