Dear Group,

The following 3 well-known lines from गीता yield new meanings...

कर्मण्येवाऽधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन  
You are obligated to do your duty but you may not always get the  
fruit. Sometimes you may only get चनाs.

सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो...  
I am the tea (मराठी चहा) and the stove that is upon everyone's mind.

बहूनि मे व्यतीतानि जन्मानि तव चार्जुन  
I have gone through many rebirths but you, O Arjuna, were born only as  
recently as on June 4.

Of course, no disrespect to the great philosophical work. Just some  
lighthearted banter...

Arvind Kolhatkar, Toronto, June 22, 2011.
