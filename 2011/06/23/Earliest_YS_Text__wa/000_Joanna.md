All,



I am tracing the earliest extant source text of the YS, regardless of medium or script (Persian/Arabic?), but I'm not getting much joy from the www.



Speculation aside, there is at least a millennium's worth of time forevolution to ring its changes between the known and the unknown- probably another half a millennium's worth too.



Differences could be instructive.
