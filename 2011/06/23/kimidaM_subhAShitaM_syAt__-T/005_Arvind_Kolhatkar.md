Dear Ashwamitra,

\<प्रायशः सुभाषितस्य कश्चित्सार्वजनिक एवाऽर्थो विद्यते इत्यहं मन्ये।>

I remember that the topic of what constitutes a सुभाषित has been  
addressed sometime back.

It is not clear to me what you mean by सार्वजनिक. Does it mean अर्थ  
that is सार्वजनिक – accepted by all or does it mean अर्थ that is  
applicable to all?  
Whatever that is, I do not think a prescription can be laid down for  
what is or is not a सुभाषित. Its definition is contained within  
itself - सु+भाषित, something that is well put or contains a worthy  
thought. This is strictly a subjective definition. A thought that is  
worthy in my view may not be so in yours. For example,

यावज्जीवेत्सुखं जीवेत्  
ऋणं कृत्वा घृतं पिबेत्।  
भस्मीभूतस्य देहस्य  
पुनरागमनं कुतः॥

may, to someone who does not believe in the afterlife and is a total  
इहवादी, appear as pragmatic wisdom. Some others may look upon it as a  
shallow guidance for how to lead one’s life on the earth. Even those,  
who otherwise do not worry too much about the afterlife, may not  
accept this hedonistic advice.  
Therefore, whether a saying is, or is not, a सु+भाषित is a question  
you have to decide for yourself. It could be a सुभाषित for a person,  
but not for others.
