If you like it as a Good Saying, you can call it a सुभाषित and if not name as part of a Chapter in Shantiparva, which is इतिहास in which the emphasis is laid on the duties of the king, in the protection of the people as evident from the beginning verse itself in that maintaining the law and order of the state:

  

1cāturāśramya dharmāś ca jātidharmāś ca pāṇḍava  
 lokapālottarāś caiva kṣātre dharme vyavasthitāḥ

  

And the moral conducts listed in three classes in the beginning
classified according to their nature.



Choice is left to you whether call it a सुभाषित literally or literary composition called सुभाषित. Just like one cannot describe the sweetness of sugar in words, one cannot describe to other the sweetness a सुभाषित contains if one doubts whether it is sugar or salt. One has to taste himself.
