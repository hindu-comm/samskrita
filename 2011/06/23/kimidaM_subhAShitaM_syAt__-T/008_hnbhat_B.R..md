In short, Good or bad is is purely left to the discretion of the reader of a poetry, whether he likes or agrees with it or not. This is meant by सुष्ठु as pointed by Aravindji which I had already indicated in my first post itself. It is purely dependent on the literal interpretation of the word सुभाषित.

  

I think you might have noticed the difference. If u are a theist आस्तिक you will certainly reject the verse quoted by Aravindji as a atheist misquote by a Charvaka school and deny the status of a सुभाषित. On the other, if you are atheist, then you will appreciate the statement and classify it as a सुभाषित. That was the purpose of quoting the popular verse. Even popularity is not a standard for being a सुभाषित.

  

Probably you meant सार्वजनिक what you had explained in your word applicable for all. Which is also clumsy like the सुष्ठु, or चमत्कारि of Abhyankar.

  

To modify your intention, to help you you can use the word सार्वत्रिक and सार्वकालिक to the content of the idea. irrespective of the context in which it is quoted and applicable to without bounds of time and space. Even that would not make a good definition, as you can see the different types of verses containing the same idea and different idea in my earlier post.

  

I put an end to this discussion, as it is already a retaking of the topic already discussed at length in another thread.

  

Anyhow I do not wish to contribute any more.
