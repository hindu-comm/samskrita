I was trying to suggest, meaningful to all, applicable to all.

So far as the content of a verse goes, this may be true, but by this  
definition the entire Mahabharata could be a subhashita, and I have  
never seen it presented as such in anthologies of subhashitas. I  
began thinking about this problem some weeks ago when someone tried to  
tell me that a passage of about twenty verses in Shantiparva is a  
subhashita. But all the anthologies that I have seen invariably  
contain only single, isolated verses. It is clear that everyone  
implicitly understands a subhashita to be a single verse. So I was  
hoping to find this characteristic in some definition of subhashita,  
whether in sanskrit or in some other language, but I have not yet  
found it. But there is another element, much more subjective, to be  
seen in most or all of the verses that I have found identified as  
subhashitas: a subhashita must have \_pith\_ (in one subhashita-defining  
subhashhita quoted by a respondent in the thread I started previously,  
the word सारवत् is used, and I thought that this might be translatable  
by the english \_pithy\_). I think that most people implicitly  
understand that a subhashita has got to have the "punch" of what in  
western literature is called the epigram: there has got to be some  
stunning element of verbal or intellectual cleverness, usually in the  
second half verse, that is चमत्कारिक. I think that this is a little  
more specific than what is meant by सुष्ठु, and that most rasikas  
would feel that there is some essential element of the subhashita  
missing in the verse that I quoted in my question.
