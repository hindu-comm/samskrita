But I think that a true rasika is able to detach himself from  
questions of personal belief when he approaches literature, which is  
why, even though at fourteen I rejected the christianity in which I  
had been raised, I even today put a lot of effort into reading Dante's  
\_Divine Comedy\_, even though whatever universalizable wisdom is  
undoubtedly there is, for me, obscured to the point of near-  
worthlessness by the distorting influence of the belief system in  
which Dante's spirituality was forced to find meaning: I am able to  
have a really intense experience of चमत्कार even while reading verses  
of Dante that are poetically brilliant but contain doctrine that is  
positively disgusting to me. From my literary point of view, the  
verse that you quote, lovely as it is, sounds slightly lame as a  
subhashita, but it does carry enough of a punch that I can believe  
that it must have been included in collections of subhashitas. But  
you are right, even after we have tried to define this "epigrammatic"  
element of the subhashita, we are here dealing, ultimately, with  
hopelessly subjective judgements, unlike in the case of the "single  
verse" criterion I was talking about earlier.
