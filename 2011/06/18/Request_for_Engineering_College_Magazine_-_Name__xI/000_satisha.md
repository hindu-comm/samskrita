Namaskaram to all the Scholars here...  
  
I work with the Magazine Editorial Team in an Engineering College. I  
am totally new to Sanskrit Language.  
  
Our College Magazine's Objective is: To develop writing skills, to  
encourage creative writing, to encourage extra curricular and co-  
curricular activities among students and faculty. The content of our  
magazine varies from engineering related articles to non-engineering.  
Paintings / Short Poems/ Collected Information/ Own Articles from  
students - on general to specific subjects, will be covered.  
Therefore, I request with you to kindly suggest a good name for our  
college magazine.  
  
Clue for names: It should be related to:  
Broader Terms: --  
1. Knowledge;  
2. Learning;  
3. To bring out the hidden talents from the minds of students  
4. To en-light  
5 Lead to right path  
6. To Achieve for best, etc.  
  
  
We prefer to choose the names from Sanskrit in the above said context.  
Because, Sanskrit has rich vocabulary  
For your Sanskrit Names, please provide Short Story or few lines why  
the particular name has been chosen ?  
  
It would be of great help and opportunity to provide best information  
from your knowledge base.  
  
Your Help and Suggestions will be highly appreciated.  
  
  
Thank You and Awaiting for your Positive Reply.  
  
Hari Om!
