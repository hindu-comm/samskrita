Please check the attached file containing the alphabetical list of धातुपाठ of पाणिनि as found in the सिद्धान्तकौमुदी (I hope the corresponding number to Dhatupatha in the GaNa serially from the beginning of the 1st conjugational group as given in the beginning note of the file can be used to identify the group also in SK)

  

The references to Panini's AshTaadhyAyi are given in my post. The second part of the string relates the verb with its meaning given in the locative (in all cases as in the present case: करणे - in the sense doing)
