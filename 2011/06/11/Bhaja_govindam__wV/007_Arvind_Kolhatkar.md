The query reminds me of a family tradition.

One of my grandfathers, Achyut Balwant Kolhatkar, was a Sanskrit  
scholar and also a very well-known fiery journalist and political  
worker of his days. (He died in 1931. There is a road named after him  
in Girgaum, Mumbai and a scholarship in his name in the Department of  
Journalism in the Pune University.) The family story is that he had  
made a  
समश्लोकी translation of चर्पटपञ्जरिकास्तोत्र but it was not  
published. I remember a few of those verses The relevant one here  
is:

भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं मूढमते।  
प्राप्ते संनिहिते मरणे न हि न हि रक्षति डुकृञकरणे॥

भज रे हरिला भज रे हरिला भज रे मूढा श्रीहरिला।  
कृतान्त सन्निध उभा ठाकता गम गच्छति नच रक्षि तुला॥
