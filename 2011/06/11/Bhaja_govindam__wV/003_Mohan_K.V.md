"du.kR.Ny" is the dhatu (verb-root) for the Sanskrit equivalent of "do" (karoti, etc). "du.kR.Ny karaNe" is one example of a standard template that defines verbs. In this case, it is defining du.kR.Ny, and means "du.kR.Ny is used to mean 'doing'" Shankara is using that as an example of saying mere worldly knowledge, like that of grammar rules like this, won't save one when death is near.

  

There's a back-story associated with it. Wikipedia puts across its version of it nicely:

  

> 
> > It is said that Adi Shankaracharya, accompanied by his disciples, was > walking along a street in Varanasi one day when he came across an aged > scholar teaching the rules of Sanskrit grammar to his students by > rote. Taking pity on him, Adi Shankaracharya went up to the scholar > and advised him not to waste his time on grammar at his age but to > turn his mind to God in worship and adoration. The hymn "Bhaja > Govindam" is said to have been composed on this occasion >
