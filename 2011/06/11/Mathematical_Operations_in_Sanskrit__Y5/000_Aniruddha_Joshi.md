Respected Scholars,

  

Namaste. I wish to know a way to describe the basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, etc. in Sanskrit.



e.g. How would one say, "2 multiplied by 2 equals 4" or "The number 100, when divided by 5, becomes 20", etc.

  

Also, it is often proclaimed that Sanskrit can be used in Computers. How can it be used precisely? Have there been efforts to write programs in Sanskrit?

  

Thanks and Regards,

  

Aniruddha Joshi
