Shri Satyajit Borwankar started the discussion on

this suject. I am summarising the background

story and its meaning as I have heard.

Adi Shankara while he was going on the banks

of river Ganges he found an elderly person

trying to learn Sanskrit grammer memorising

the Panini Ganapatha डु कृञ् करणे.

He instantly addressed this sloka to him

भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं गोविन्दं भज मूढमते /

संप्राप्ते सन्निहिते मरणे नहि नहि रक्षति डु कृञ् करणे //



Oh Stupid Fellow! Worship Govinda. Worship

Govinda. Worship Govinda. When death comes

this formula will not help you.

  

The version which is mostly found is

संप्राप्ते सन्निहिते काले. I do not agree with this.

Becasue मरणे rhymes with करणे.

Sankara is fond of using rhymes in all

his compositions.
