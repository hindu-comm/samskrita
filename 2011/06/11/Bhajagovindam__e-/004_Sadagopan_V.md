Suppose"du krunj karane" refers tomastering the whole dhatupatha andas parellel anology implies mastering all the saastras. Will"du krunj karane"be enough for one's lifetime?No. At the end of the day,one's actionsalone count. "bhaja Govindam" tells us what that requiredaction is according to saastras.



Why choose "du krunj" whereas "bhu" has pride of place in dhatupatha?
Only to drive home the point that thinking about "to act" is one thing. Action is quite another thing. If so, there is no old man; no young acharya. No stupid fellow; no jnani. For all one may know "sannihita kala" for the old man need not be short compared that of young acharya either.
