Any how, in spite of the popular reading, you are free to change it as you like it.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/30b4dac5b6fdf455/338.gif?part=0.1)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/30b4dac5b6fdf455/338.gif?part=0.1)  
because Sankara is not here to approve of it or deny it![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/30b4dac5b6fdf455/32C.png?part=0.2)  
  

Others may not like it if it is not supported by any of the manuscripts readings.

  

How would you change this one of the same stotra for rhyme?:

  

जटिलो मुण्डी लुञ्चितकेशः काषायाम्बरबहुकृतवेशः।  
पश्यन्नपि च न पश्यति मूढः उदरनिमित्तं बहुकृतवेशः॥ 14
