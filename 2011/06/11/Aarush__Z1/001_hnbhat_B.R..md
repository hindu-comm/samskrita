If it isअरुष् = (*mfn).*not angry , good-tempered  
  

butआरुष् derived from(आ-√रुष्Caus. to make furious) would give the opposite meaning "making some agngry, or il-tempered.

  

This much can be said if any meaning is sought from Sanskrit. It is not necessary for proper names to seek any meaning, which are calledसंज्ञाशब्द-s likeडित्थ which need not have any meaning than serving the purpose to identify the person/object they denote from others.
