Dear Group,  
  
(The original thread about this word and its meaning seems to have  
disappeared into a limbo, hence this new thread...)  
  
It seems we were barking the wrong tree in the matter of ‘Aarush’, as  
taken from PKR in his initial posting.  
  
Indeed, none of the words that can go with this transliteration, viz.,  
आरुश, आरुश्, आरुष, आरुष् are found in MW. However, अरुश, अरुष, अरुष्  
corresponding to the transliteration Arush, have meanings in MW, and  
these are generally complimentary.  
  
One meaning of अरुश is Indra (source Rigveda). अरुष has several  
meanings, all connected with Agni, Ushas, the red color, etc., and  
‘first ray of the Sun’ too can be read into it, albeit after some  
stretching. अरुष् is ‘good-tempered’ (source Pancatantra).  
  
If our respective nephews or nieces deign to follow the correct form  
Arush instead of Aarush, I suppose there should be no problem.
