The tadditAnta of aru{sh\|Sh\|s ..} can likely be aaru{sh\|Sh\|s ..} -> pertaining to Indra / agni / uShas / sun / good temperamented ....

  

tadditAnta of vasudeva is vAsudeva ...

  

Just a thought.

  

Wishing the two Aarushs who triggered this thread the best in their lives - may they be founts of good knowledge.
