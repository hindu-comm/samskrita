Dear Sir,

  

I don't think there is any need for scholastic discussion any more on this topic. Our friend Aravindji has already suggested that he got the meaning for his baby from the baby name suggesting sites which are many on the net. We can also find the same thing if we search for the name with the same meaning on many other sites. One of the sites is here I got, (by all means this is not the only one you get, but a number of them):

  

<http://www.all-babynames.com/meaning-of-name-Aarush.html>

  

The days for scholastic discussions are gone in our group and now whatever found on the net have their authenticity for any many skilled in browsing the net with search Engines. Like this one case which need not any scholastic opinion. First, the sites do not give any clue of the language from which the word is picked up and source for their meaning which needs any language in which it is used with the meaning suggested. Any parents browse and get any name they like from these sites and be content with the meaning that is offered in them. Why should we bother about it in our group at all?

  

Hope you also will be content with the observations of Aravindji too.
