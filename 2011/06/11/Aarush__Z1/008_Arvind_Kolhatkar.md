Aarush, as a name, seems to the flavor of the month! I was told that  
a daughter of a cousin of mine, delivered a son 4 days ago. His  
parents plan to call him, - what else? - Aarush. They have picked up  
this name from a name-suggesting website, which also proffers the  
helpful advice that it means 'the first ray of the Sun'!  
  
LOL...
