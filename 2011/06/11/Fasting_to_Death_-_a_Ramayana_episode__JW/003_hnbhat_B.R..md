And when Shambuka a shUdra, resorted to tapas, Rama cut his head off, to save the worlds. But I think he was not yet born, when it was of his own caste, Vishvamitra, who succeeds in tapas, to get BrahmarShi status.

(With apologies requested from Valmiki, by whose time Vishvamitra, should have been confirmed in his new status from Rajarshi to Brahmarshi, approved by the real Brahmarshi, Vasishtha).

  

  

Great people like his own mother say "Raamo vigrahavAn DharmaH"

when she insisted him to stick to his fathers promise to his step mother.



So beyond any questioning, he himself is the embodiment of Dharma.
