Like the Dhyanashloka-s of Bhagavad Geeta, they might have been composed/compiled at a later period by a scholar/devotee to contribute to the devotees of his time like many other devotional poets.   
  

Similar one is Gayatri Sahasranama, too organized in the alphabetical order, the thousand epithets of Gayatri as the goddess.

  

May be found place in some of the PuraaNa-s.

  

I too have heard the RamayaNa was originally composed of 24 thousand verses by Valmiki, each thousand set beginning with the corresponding 24 letters of Gayatri. However, it is a great invention. The same is true of the original one Lakh verses of Mahabharata originally called Jaya samhita (of Laksha verses), which increased and revised in its size all comprehensively so it got named Mahabharata giving rise to the saying because of its all pervasive nature:

  

"यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित्"

 

In the case of RamayaNa, the status has been equated with Veda-s too:

  

वेदवेद्ये परे पुंसि जाते दशरथात्मजे।

वेदः प्राचेसादासीत् साक्षाद् रामायणात्मना॥

  

By the way, there have been some audio renderings of Gayatri Ramayana. One is can be downloaded here if anybody is interested:

Another compilation of epithets in order describing Ramayana story is नामरामायण sung by many artistes, but popular one by MSS.
