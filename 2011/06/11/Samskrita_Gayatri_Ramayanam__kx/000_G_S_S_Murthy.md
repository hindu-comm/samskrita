Dear All,  
As many would know because of its popularity, Gayatri Ramayanam is a stirng of verses picked up at intervals of 1000 verses of Valmiki Ramayanam and the first letters of the verses together form Gayatri mantra. Many recite it as a substitute for Ramayana Parayanam.  
Govindaraja the commentator does not refer to these verses as forming Gayatri Ramyanam. He identifies some other verses as 1000- verse markers and identifies one of the syllables in the verse as forming the corresponding syllable of Gayatri Mantra. Apparently verses recognized by him have not gained recognition. Maheswara Tirtha also does not specifically make a mention in the matter.  
Who is responsible for stringing the Gayatri Ramayanam from Valmiki Ramayanam? Is it mentioned in any Purana?  
Regards  
Murthy
