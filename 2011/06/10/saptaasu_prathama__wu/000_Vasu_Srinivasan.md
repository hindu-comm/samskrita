In one of his lectures, sanskrita/vaidika scholar Bannanje Govindacharya mentions about one vibhakti being used as substitutes of other vibhaktis. I know that 6th can be substituted for all other vibhaktis (for eg 4th tasmai => tasya krute etc). But he mentioned in sanskrita there is the following:

  

saptaasu prathama (1st vibhakti can be used in all 7 cases)

shatsu dvitiyaa (2nd can be used in 6 cases)

like that 3rd vibhakti can be used in 5 cases, 4th vibhakti can be used in 4 cases, 7th can be used only in the sense of 7th.

  

Would love to know any details about this...
