There are many cases substituted for other cases. They can be checked in Siddhantakaumudi kArakaprakaraNa. No counting is done generally as it doesn't any way useful for the correct usage. Better you can check with the original source in which Bannanje Govindacharya has given the statistics. Probably he is not satisfied with Paninian system as expounded Bhattoji DikShita and his followers due to their hair splitting precision discussion.

  

  

Anyhow, the highlighted usage is highly improbable according to Paninian standard. It would be only सप्तसु normally in all the three genders. I don't know Bannjanje had used it as you have given above.
