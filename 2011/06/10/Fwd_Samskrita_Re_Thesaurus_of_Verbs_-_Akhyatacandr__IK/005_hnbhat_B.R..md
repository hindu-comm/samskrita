Hope all the members can make use of it.

  

Please follow the guidelines to understand the lines correctly.

  

1\. The meaning of an item is given in locative case and the verbal forms used in the sense and their synonyms are given in the present tense third person singular form.

  

Eg.सत्तायाम्\[(in the sense of "existence" (to be)\] अस्ति भवति विद्यते (२) *चाथ* जन्मनि (birth - to be born)।

  

etc.

  

2\. The conjugation group of verb has to be inferred from the forms presented for the present tense.  
  

3\. As in "Amara" lexicon, the the new items of synonyms presented are separated by from the previous ones with the use of indeclinables "atha" and"tu". The example for the first is in the line cited above. The ca, belongs to the previous portion, and the next item begins with "atha"

  

विंशतिः स्युः\] भ्रूणयते त्वपि लुभ्यति गृध्यति ।

  

In the above , he finishes the previous item giving the total number 22 of synonyms used for "wishing" and starts a new set of six items with the form appending "tu" used for "lust" or "greed" (गार्ध्ये).(1.3.59)

  

3\. Even though it is not followed everywhere, mostly he gives the total number of synonyms as can be seen in the above.  

  

4\. Rarely, he indicates whether Atmanepada or Parasmaipada in case it is needed. (If he gives one only, where both are used or differs in meaning in both individually.)

  

विवेके तु विवेवेक्ति विविनक्ति आत्मने ऽप्ययम्

  

Hope this will be enough for decoding the textual lines generally and more of its way of presentation can be familiarized as reading continues throughout the text.

  

With regards
