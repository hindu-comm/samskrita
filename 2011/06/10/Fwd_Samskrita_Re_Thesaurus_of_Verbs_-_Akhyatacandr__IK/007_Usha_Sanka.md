Namaste

Just wanted to inform something in this regard.

I have digitized this koSa- for my personal use- not as shlokas but as a list with numbering.

Sample is here-

1.1.9. विकासे –

1. स्फुटति

2. स्फोटते

3. फुल्लति

4. उन्मीलयति

5. पुष्प्यति

6. विजृम्भते

7. विकचते

8. विकसति

In the text it will be like this- (pl. see attachment)

  

I can share it if needed for anyone.. Just some final checking is needed. It will take some more time.

Declaring it so that no one has to repeat or re-do the process.

  

One more issue- the link for download has name with typo

(here-
