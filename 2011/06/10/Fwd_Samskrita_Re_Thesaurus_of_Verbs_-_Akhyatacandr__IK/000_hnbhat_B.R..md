Here is one आख्यातचन्द्रिका by भट्टमल्ल a thesaurus for verbs in Sanskrit compiled on the same line of अमरकोश for nouns. Here also it is arranged into semantic classes arranged in a certain order. There are some others also, like धातुरत्नावली, धातुरत्नप्रदीपः of मैत्रेयरक्षित etc. but they are focussed on their conjugation in groups.  

  



I can share a scanned copy of the above आख्यातचन्द्रिका. -
