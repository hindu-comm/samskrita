Dears  
This is amir hossein Randjbar, PHd. in philosophy.  
But I would like to learn Sanskrit language as an ancient language.  
I'm familiar with some alive languages like English, French, German  
and Arabic; as an Iranian I would learn Pahlavi & Avestan as well.  
My potentiality for learning language is very well. When I was 39 I  
did start learning Russian in 6 mounths. Anyhow I'm very glad  
to joining to your group.Meanwhile I prefer to rename my nickname as  
" Ardeshir".  
YOURS  
Amir Hossein Randjbar (Ardeshir)

\* Nowadays I'm a researcher on the history of ideas in the field of Islamic  
civilization and culture on the one hand & Iran on the other.  
I'm waiting for your response as soon as possible.
