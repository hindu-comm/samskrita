Namaste Shriman Abhyankar Mahodaya!  
  
Actually, by "our Sanskrit" I meant the language of all the humanity, not only of India or somewhere. This language belongs to all those humans of the world who want to see a betterment in their society and take pains for it, that is, they practice the human values described in our literature in their lives and not just lecture on them. We all need to practice the best rules of our culture in order to make a better, refined, sanskrita, egalitarian society. I hope my point is clear now.  
  
With best regards,  
Madhav
