The Tulpule-Feldhaus Dictionary of Old Marathi says that Aai आई  
(Marathi) derives from Skt आर्या. Apparently, at some stage while  
Marathi was being formed, someone started the practice of calling his  
mother asआर्या-आई and that was picked up by others. In Sanskrit too  
the mother is addressed as अम्ब. And of course there are words like  
माई, मैय्या in Hindi and other languages. Take the म out and you have  
Marathi आई.
