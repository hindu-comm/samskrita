Very interesting discussion. Thanks for good guesses as usual without any solid proof in support. I also add one more guess from my memory I had heard long ago: jasomati maiyyaa se bole nandalaala

  

The above word could have been adopted into Marathi with feminine additional double suffix mayyI \>\> maayii \>\> maa{}I

  

or ,may a confounding of two words मा + आया ?? माई \>\> आई

  

resulting in the initial M consonant finally.
