AAYII FOR MOTHER IN MARATHI...........



AACHHI / AAYII/ AAI IN TAMIL

THAAI, ANNAI, AATTHAAare also used



and of courseAMMA  

I have also heard of the term AMMAAYII



seems like a good exchange of loan words across cultures



We,in India are indeed a wonderful mix and remix of different minor variants of homosapiens, as our mitochondrial DNAs would one day "prove".The generous exchange of words, ideasand genes reflects in all our rich languages,mental habits, physical traits etc.



Dhanyaasthu te Bharatha bhoomibhaage!
