Hello Anand ji,  
  
Namaskaar.  
  
It is said that Marathi belongs to the southernmost branch of Indo-Aryan languages along with Konkani, Sinhalese and Divehi ( The national language of Maldives).  
  
It is bordered to the immediate south by Dravidian languages such as Kannada, Telugu, Tulu, Kodagu, etc.  
  
The word aai (=mother) is perhaps of Dravidian origin, evolving in prehistoric times, perhaps from Proto-Dravidian. It's also said that about 5% of **Marathi basic vocabulary** is of Dravidian origin. Certain Austro-Asiatic languages such as Munda, too might have had an influence on Marathi vocabulary.  
  
I'm attaching herewith a document which gives those words in Marathi, which are of probable Non Indo-Aryan / Non Indo-European origin.  
  
Thanks and Regards,  
  
Aniruddha
