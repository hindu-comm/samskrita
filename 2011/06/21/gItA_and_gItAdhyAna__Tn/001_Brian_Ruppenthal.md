Friends,

Going back to the गीता ध्यानम्...

I found what may be a source, if not the original source, for the  

Dhyāna Śloka set of nine verses. If anyone is interested, do please  
see what you  
think.

The dhyāna ślokas occur in what seems to be known as the

  
śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā, which itself is a part of something called the  
GAUDIYA GRANTHA MANDIRA. Or at least, I found a work with those  

titles, that does indeed contain the dhyāna ślokas. Here is the  
link:

<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/vaisn/sadhdipu.htm>

I have no idea about the age of this work. It seems to be a compendium  
drawing from many other sources, and full of quotes from, for example,  
the Gita. It is definitely Vaishnavite. Might this be what  
Radhakrishnan was referring to as the Vaishnava Tantrasara?

I also found the following statements as to specific verse origins, at  
an A.C, Bhaktivedanta-related website -- which (oddly, I would say)  
lists Adi Shankara as the original author of the the Gita Dhyaanam:

"REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:

"Verse 5 is the first verse of Adi Sankara’s Krsnastakam

"The last verse is often sung with the suffixed-line “śrī guruḿ  
dīna-tāraṇam” offering obeisances to the “spiritual master that is the  
redeemer of the fallen.”

"The final verse comes from the Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 12 Chapter 13 Verse 1."

Back to Brian speaking...

I have confirmed that the final verse does indeed appear in the Srimad  
Bhagavatam:

I could not confirm that any verse comes from Adi Shankara's Kṛṣṇāṣṭakam:

(I am also not sure either if this is certainly by Adi Shankara, but  
that is a side topic.)
