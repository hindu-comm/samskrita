नमो नमः श्रीमन् अभ्यंकर् -महोदय !

Thank you for your careful reply regarding the गीता-ध्यानम् , and the  
text I had stumbled upon which contains those shlokas.

I believe you are concluding that the text which I linked to, the  
śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā, is of  
most recent vintage? The fact, which you point out, that the  
textcontains Hindi would surely prove that assertion.

Perhaps it would be pointless to seek further information about the  
text that I found, the śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā? I cannot tell if it is  
worth pursuing.

In my case, I had simply searched for key words of the गीता-ध्यानम् .  
I was also looking for the Vaishnave Tantrasara, which supposedly  
contains the गीता-ध्यानम् .  
In that way I came upon this text, the śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā, hosted at a  
reputable academic website which is associated with the University of  
Goettingen in Germany.

This is all I know about the śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā text.

But, as you may remember from earlier in this thread, S. Radhakrishnan  
identified the 'Vaishnava Tantrasara' as the source text for the  
गीता-ध्यानम् . I have worked hard to locate this text. On finding  
this śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā, containing the गीता-ध्यानम् , I had thought  
the two might be the same text. Your post causes me to doubt this  
conclusion.

Again, thanks.

And I also want to apologize to the group for multiple postings of  
this same earlier message, from me. There is an oddity in how things  
get posted at Google Groups, which so far eludes me! This time however  
I will just assume that my message will get out there in a timely  
fashion.

Yes. I was looking for a text which contains the गीता-ध्यानम्, . So I  
expected a larger text. I had hoped this was the Vaishnave Tantrasara  
that Radhakrishnan referred to as the source text for the  
गीता-ध्यानम्, .
