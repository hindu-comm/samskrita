Friends,

Going back to the Gita Dhyaanam...

I found what may be a source, if not the original source, for the  
Dhyaana Shlokas. If anyone is interested, do please see what you  
think.

The Dhyaana Shlokas occur in what seems to be known as the  
śrī-sādhanā-dīpikā, which itself is a part of something called the  
GAUDIYA GRANTHA MANDIRA. Or at least, I found a work with those  
titles, that does indeed contain the Dhyaana Shlokas. Here is the  
link:

<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/vaisn/sadhdipu.htm>

I have no idea about the age of this work. It seems to be a compendium  
drawing from many other sources, and full of quotes from, for example,  
the Gita. It is definitely Vaishnavite. Might this be what  
Radhakrishnan was referring to as the Vaishnava Tantrasara?

I also found the following statements as to specific verse origins, at  
an A.C, Bhaktivedanta-related website -- which (oddly, I would say)  
lists Adi Shankara as the original author of the the Gita Dhyaanam:

"REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:

Verse 5 is the first verse of Adi Sankara’s Krsnastakam

"The last verse is often sung with the suffixed-line “śrī guruḿ  
dīna-tāraṇam” offering obeisances to the “spiritual master that is the  
redeemer of the fallen.”

"The final verse comes from the Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 12 Chapter 13 Verse 1."

I have confirmed that the final verse does indeed appear in the Srimad  
Bhagavatam:

I could not confirm that any verse comes from Adi Shankara's Kṛṣṇāṣṭakam:

I would be much interested in further responses and/or discussion  
here, from any of the learned members.

\> Dear Group,

\> I would like to summarize our findings regarding the Dhyāna Ślokas.

\> We now have seen these works and/or great teachers cited as 'the' original  
\> source: Vaiṣņavīya Tantrasāra, Adi Śankarācārya himself, Shridhara Swami of  
\> some centuries ago, Shridhara Swami of recent times, and Madhusudhana  
\> Saraswati.

For certainty, Śankarācārya himself doesn't quote these shloka-s, as in all  
the versions, his commentary on Bhagavadgita, begins with the 2nd chapter  
introducing the philosophic content beginning with अशोच्यानन्वशोचस्त्वं etc.  
with a summary of the preceding portion. And as the DhyAna-shloka-s have  
little philosophical content, in themselves, he has not possibly quoted.  
VaishNava- sources may have quoted them, but somewhere they should have  
originated during the transmission of the text for religious purpose and  
उपासना which is part and parcel of Tantra-s than philosophy.

Vaishnava-tantra may not be a specific Tantra text, or some abridged version  
TantrasAra, based on पाञ्चरात्र or other VaishNavaite Tantra. It is a larger  
field to survey and without specific chronology like the PurANa-s.

When it became appended to the text of BhagavadgitA available is still a  
question without any specific answer without definite chronology assessable  
to the texts.
