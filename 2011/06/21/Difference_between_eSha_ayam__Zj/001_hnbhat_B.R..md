Here is the precise difference:  
  
There is a कारिका in this matter which goes as follows:

More can be known from the link to the topic already explained. Just got search the google group. Whether you follow the convention or not is up to your choice now a days when spoken Sanskrit is the governing factor.

  

There is another tricky choice between retaking and original इदम् and एतद् in sentences. In certain case endings, it is replaced by एनद् द्वितीया, तृतीयैकवचनम्, षष्ठी द्विवचनम्. specically.

  

अनेन छन्दोऽधीतम्, एनं व्याकरणमध्यापय। etc.
