Here is a online Commentary on the Sutra:

  
============================  
Longevity  
Ch. (1) - The Ancient Lineage Of The Tradition Of Ayurvedic Learning

"This is the description of Longevity Chapter with distinction."  
(Charaka Samhita, Sutra Section, Ch. 1/1,)

Dr Vikrama's Commentary: The first word that is used is 'Atha'. This  
word denotes all the three - blessings, prayer and goodwill for all.  
This word has been used in several ayurveda and yoga classics of  
ancient times and is considered auspicious in the begining of literary  
works.

Long life represents life span with health and happiness. Longevity is  
described with distinction that is, this topic is covered in holistic  
sense as related to body, health and disease.

For more it can be referred to here:

Literallly, it would mean simply: "Here after let us  
explain/comment/learn on the Chapter related to Long Life."

as usual to the beginning of any Shastra. The commentaries and the  
texts presuppose the introduction to the related suject and well  
familiar with other texts. Hence now onwards(after knowing the  
prerequisite introduction to the Science), let us take the study of  
Long Life in the first Chapter (as taught by Atreya) .

The great seer Atreya was the disciple and son of another sage Atri.  
Atreya was known as Punarvasu Atreya. More of this can be found in the  
above commentary in the link.
