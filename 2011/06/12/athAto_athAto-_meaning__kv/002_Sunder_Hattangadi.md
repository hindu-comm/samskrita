Following gives a translation/commentary of the word "athAto" by AdiShankaracharya in the context of Badarayana Brahmasutra:



<http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_1/1-1-01.html>



".....Athato Brahmajijnasa I.1.1 (1)



Now, therefore, the enquiry into Brahman.



Atha: now, then, afterwards; Atah: therefore; Brahmajijnasa: a desire for the knowledge of Brahman (the enquiry into the real nature of Brahman).

``

Sutra literally means a string. It serves the purpose of stringing together the flowers of the Vedanta passages.



The word Atha is not used to introduce a new subject that is going to be taken up. It is here to be taken as denoting immediate consecution.

The enquiry of Brahman specially depends upon some antecedent conditions. The enquirer should be endowed with certain spiritual requisites or qualifications. Then only the enquiry is possible.

Atha i.e., after the attainment of certain preliminary qualifications such as the four means of salvation viz., (1) Nitya-anitya-vastu-viveka (discrimination between the eternal and the non-eternal); (2) Ihamutrarthaphalabhogaviraga (indifference to the enjoyment in this life or in heaven, and of the fruits of one's actions); (3) Shatsampat (sixfold virtues viz., Sama - control of mind, Dama - control of the external senses, Uparati - cessation from worldly enjoyments or not thinking of objects of senses or discontinuance of religious ceremonies, Titiksha - endurance of pleasure and pain, heat and cold, Sraddha - faith in the words of the preceptor and of the Upanishads and Samadhana - deep concentration); (4) Mumukshutva (desire for liberation)........."



Similar interpretations may exist elsewhere also; e.g. Jaimini Sutra-s start with "athAto dharma-jij\~nAsA"; Narada Bhakti-sutras with "athAto bhaktiM vyAkhyAsyAmaH", etc.
