Hi all,

usually most of sUtra start with the word 'अथातो' .

e.g.अथातो दीर्घंजीवितीयं अध्यायं व्याख्यास्यामः । । १,१.१ - charaka saMhitA

What is the precise meaning of this compound.

I am sure some of the commentaries of sUtras must have expounded its meaning in detail.

  

Can anyone tell me the meaning of the word please...

  

Dhaval
