Hi all,

I was reading a book called hariharabhedastuti..

  

I found the following shloka particularly interesting..

  

मारमणमुमारमणं फणधरतल्पं फणाधराकल्पम् ।

मुरमथनं पुरमथनं वन्दे बाणारिमसमबाणारिम् ॥ १॥

  

I am sure, this is some type of alankara, but i am not able to place it correctly.

Can anyone help me put this alankara in its proper category...

  

I mean it is not pure yamaka or shlesha, because the words are somewhat different, but still some sort of beautiful similarity in the words....

  

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Dhaval
