It seems mainly "yamaka" due to the repetition of the same words in a certain order, but at times to makes use of सभङ्गश्लेष or अभङ्गश्लेष to differentiate the meaning as required to be a Yamaka.



Others may differ in the precise differentiation between Yamaka and श्रुत्यनुप्रास or वर्णानुप्रास which do not take into account the words and their meaning within their definition.

  

With regards
