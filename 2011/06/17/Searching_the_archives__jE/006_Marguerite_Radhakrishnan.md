No, it's just the "zipped" versions that will be disabled, I believe most probably because so few people use "zipped" files anymore that there's not enough demand to warrant Google's continued support of that functionality. (Correct me if I'm wrong and it's the archives as a whole -- at least from this end, it looks to be just the "zipped" files.)
