Namaste,  
  
To search the archives, here is an option:  
Go to the mailing list homepage at <http://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/>  
  
In the top-right corner, you will find a search box. Type the word and click "Search this group".  
  
Using a recent posting as an example, suppose you remember that you want to search for a subhashita that contains पीयते, you can type पीयते in unicode devanagari and see results. Not everyone uses devanagari in posts, so you may also want to search separately for "piyate" typed in English.
