Thanks Nareshji for providing the efficient search engine. I tried it and found it useful.



It is my humble request to the members that evey one make use of this facility provided before starting a new topic so that duplication can be avoided. Today I searching in my inbox itself, I saw 4 threads already started with the same topic बुभुक्षितैर्व्याकरणं न भुज्यते.



This will help a lot of time of other members too, if the answer you are looking for is already available discussed earlier in the group, saving their time in replying the duplicate threads.



One can search any word also if one is willing to know more and only need to start a new thread if not already available. Different combinations of required words can be used to find exactly what one wants.



Hope this facilitywill be made use by every member to the utmost benefit.



Thanking once again
