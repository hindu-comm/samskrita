Friends,

In an announcement that comes up on my screen at least, Google tells  
us that after August 30 the archives will be disabled. Isn't that so?  
Or am I misreading the announcement? If it is the case, it would seem  
we will lose lots of interesting and useful material from this group.

Are we considering any response to this? And I do not mean that anyone  
should pester Google about it. Instead, I would hope that some  
alternative archiving method might arise.

Brian
