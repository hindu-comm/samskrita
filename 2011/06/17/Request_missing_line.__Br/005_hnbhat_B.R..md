शुचि भूषयति श्रुतं वपुः is the classical usage of the word श्रुत in the sense of learning (किरातार्जुनीये २---३२)

Kalidasa's usage also. 

  

गुर्वर्थमर्थी श्रुतपारदृश्वा means Kutsa, who has seen the farthest end of learning, i.e. finished his learning.

(रघुवंशः। । ५.२४ । । )

  

In Sanskrit this is the connotation for श्रुतं without any specific object, just like listen to. = pay attention. etc. in English. as in the following usage:

  

स किं सखा साधु न शास्ति यऽधिपं हितान्न यः*संशृणुते*स किं प्रभुः।

  

Who doesn't listen to (the words of ) those who wish his welfare is a bad king. ((किरातार्जुनीये १---०५)

  

It is this meaning of the verb used here in आकर्णयति too if taken literally. In the literal sense, it is due to the learning orally from the guru (which is naturally received through the ears). That is how it came to be used in the sense of learning. Even in its restricted use, it can be used to convey Vedic learning, but not common.

  

Hope this is the meaning as I have grasped from those lines.

Due to internet problem, I could not send my earlier message properly with precise references.
