Ah :) This reminds of this verse by Bhartrhari:

  

jAtiryAtu rasAtalam guNagaNaiH tatrApyadho gamyatam

zIlam zailataTAt patatu-abhijanaH sandahyatAm vahninA \|

zaurye vairini vajramAzu nipatatu-artho'stu nah kevalam

yenaikena vinA gunAH tRNalavaprAyAh samastA ime \|\| 39\|\|

  

Roughly translated, "May noble birth go (be damned) to RasAtala (one of the netherworlds, but not the lowest). May the whole heap of all good qualities be damned to a world even lower. May Character fall off a cliff, may Family honour be burnt by fire and may enemies sink the Vajrayudha into Courage ASAP. All we ask for is Money, that without which all these qualities are worthless"

  

This appears to be a direct response to Bana's complaint about Lakshmi in his Shukanasopadesa; of course, it may also be referring to something else altogether:

  

न परिचयम् रक्षति \| *न अभिजनम् ईक्षते* \| न रूपम् आलोकयते \| *न कुलक्रमम् अनुवर्तते* \| *न शीलम् पश्यति* \| न वैद्ग्ध्यम् गणयति \| न श्रुतम् आकर्णयति \| न धर्मम् अनुरुध्यते \| न त्यागम् आद्रियते \| न विशेषज्ञताम् विचारयति \| न आचारम् पालयति \| न सत्यम् अनुबुध्यते \| न लक्षणम् प्रमाणी-करोति \| गन्धर्व-नगर-लेखा इव पश्यत एव नश्यति \|  
  

In this I love the 'na zrutam AkarNayati' line. A translation in English could be "She is blind to a person who has seen the world". There was an article sometime ago about how in some cultures, hearing is 'higher' than seeing. So like we have "I see" as an interjection in English, in some languages it's "I hear".
