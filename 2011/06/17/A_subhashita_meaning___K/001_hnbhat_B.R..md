The above verse is found in Pancatantra Book 4 लब्धप्रणाश Verse No.16 and 32. You can find more about the composition of Pancatantra in this link:

  

<http://www.market4us.com/panchatantra/>

  

The first half is taken in हितोपदेश also:

  

त्यजेत्क्षुधार्ता महिला स्वपुत्रं

खादेत्क्षुधार्ता भुजगी स्वमण्डं ।

बुभुक्षितः किं न करोति पापं

क्षीणा नरा निष्करुणा भवन्ति  । । ४.६० । \|

  

Hence this half has to be taken into consideration with the context to be translated.

  

The contexts differ for the both the SubhAshita-s. In the first, Pancatantra,

it is the story of Gangadatta, the frog who made friendship with a serpent Priyadarshana, whom he brought to its residence, inside a well to revenge his cousin brothers and the other frogs in the well were offered to please the serpent. Later, he somehow escaped from the well, making him to believe that he will bring more frogs to him daily and didn't return. Then the serpent sent गोधा (the alligator)a messenger, to him bring it back to get more of frogs to another pond where it was now hiding. Then listening to the words of the serpent, the frog गङादत्त tells the messenger, the words in reply to the serpent.

  

  

What is the sin the hungry one cannot do and the feeble (out of loss of strength) will be without any mercy (to earn their food).

\[In other words, there is no consideration of sin or merit when one is hungry and feeble yearning to gain strength.\]

So tell Priyadarshana (the serpent), dear friend (bhadre), that Gangadatta (the frog) won't come back to the well.



The standard translation is below A W Ryder:

  

The hungry man at nothing sticks;

The poor man has his heartless tricks.

Tell Handsome, miss, that Theodore

Will see him in the well no more.

  

More appropriate translation can be expected from the other learned members.
