Namaste to all,

  

I found the following humorous incident [here](http://in.mg50.mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch?.rand=8ph42djqd28u2).  

----------------------------------------------------------------  

We find in the *Nāma-siddhi-jātaka-gāthā* (No. 67) that a person named *Pāpaka* who was in search of good name came back to his house disappointed seeing *Jīvaka* as dead, finding *Dhanapāla* in poor condition and noticing Panthaka roaming about in woods.  

जीवक च मत दिस्वा, धानपालि च दुग्गतम् । पंथक च वने मूढं पापको पुनरायतो ।।  

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
I assume that the above verse is in Pali. Is there a Sanskrit version of this verse?  



regards  
shankara
