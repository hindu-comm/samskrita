Thanks for the nice post. It is a fact that there are no exact synonyms even within a language, and it will be too much expect them translatable with synonyms with the similar words of another language which has a different cultural and social bound contents of each language community. In many cases, only an explanation (brief as above or some times descriptive of the idea) would be capable of translating the idea in the most imperfect way. Sanskrit has got many such words as suggested by you. Some times the ideas may concur together between the two.

  

भीमकर्म - Herculian effort

  

Adam was the first man according to Biblical sources, but it cannot translate or convey the Manu lineage started by Manu, the first man according to Hindu mythology.

  

काम is the diety of erotics, somehow translated into English with parallel name of a diety Cupid.

  

Only such distant parallelisms could be found for certain words, but not for all. Like Dharma can be translated in many ways, propriety, attributes, of a substance and also the righteous conduct or in many ways, but depends on the context.

  

With eka, "एके मुख्यान्यकेवलाः" describes the different shades of meanings of the word which is considered as pronoun and a numeral also by its nature.
