Sorry for omission of the word in the verse quoted in my first post. Please re-read the above with the correction. Here is my translation>

  

His mind confused of making a difference between these two poor and dead (nirdhana and nidhana), Brahma, the creator god, hosted his flag for success, a "repha" (consonant "r") in between them.(since he was not ready to accept his inability to differentiate between the two, he succeeded by inserting the consonant (in nirdhana) to differentiate them.



I think this verse too won't yield any literal translation as such in English.
