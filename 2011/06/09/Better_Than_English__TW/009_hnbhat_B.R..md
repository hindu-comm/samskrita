The correct translation would be in the present tense from Sanskrit: Rama kills RaavaNa.

It is because in English, only transitive verbs can take take passive voice and not intransitive verbs. In Sanskrit, even intransitive verbs can be use passively, but there is no object for the verbs of motion in parallel to English grammar in the first case and in the second, all the intransitive verbs could be used passively and could not be translated into English due to the above restriction of passive voice to transitive voice (in English) and no parallel structure of bhAva lakAra.
