Interesting thread.

  

Apart from the nouns etc, there is also one type of sentence construct that I feel is untranslatable:

  

This is fine:

raama: raavaNam hanti \| (Rama killed Ravana)

raameNa raavaNa: hata: \| (Ravana is killed by Rama)

  

The next one is more or less fine, though awkward:

sa: devaalayam gacchati \| (He goes to the temple)

tena devaalaya: gamyate \| (Temple is gone to by him)

  

How about the following?

sa: asti -> He is

tena bhUyate -> ???
