THis appears appropriate.The previous one uses the same words both for good and bad people and it is far fetched to interprete to give different meanings``

This is the verse I had heard long ago -

  

मनस्येकं वचस्येकं कर्मण्येकं महत्मनाम् /

मनस्यन्यत् वचस्यन्यत् कर्मण्यन्यत् दुरात्मनाम् //

  

You can have your own translation.

Hi,

  

There's a blog, [Better Than English](http://betterthanenglish.com/), that collects complex words from other languages that have no easy translations in English. I'm sure Sanskrit has tons of such words, though my vocabulary is too small to give examples. For our own entertainment, I thought of creating a thread for this.

  

What do you think are the most beautiful,untranslatablewords/phrases/elegantly expressed ideas you know in Sanskrit?

  

Let me start off. One nice untranslatable verse I know is:

  

manasyekam vachasyekam karmaNyekam durAtmanAm

manasyekam vachasyekam karmaNyekam sadAtmanAm

  

("The evil man has one thing on his mind, another in word and another in deed; The noble man has the (same) thing in his mind, word and deed"; 'ekam' has a very nuanced meaning that is impossible to translate)
