I am afraid I have not seen such a dictionary. As far as I know of a book on Grammar of Kannada language composed by keshirAja inCir.1260 AD, entitled शब्दमणिदर्पण and I have read it too edited and published by Kittel.

  

The first grammar book was by Nagavarma II (Cir. 1040 AD) who wrote two books on grammar, शब्दस्मृति and कर्णाटकभाशा-भूषणम्.(both published) of which the second is written in Sanskrit

  

And, the first dictionary for Sanskrit was compiled by Ref. Kittel who had edited Keshiraja's ShabdamaNidarpaNa also.
