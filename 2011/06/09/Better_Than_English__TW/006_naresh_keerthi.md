Herculean task is closer to bhagIratha-prayatna, rather than bhIma-karma, don't you think..?  
  
Also, rather than pick on proper nouns like adam, cupid, manu, manmatha etc, we should look for common nouns, verbs, abstract nouns and adjectives that are unique, nuanced and untranslatable.  
  
The adjective lalita has my vote - It has so many fine layers of meaning.
