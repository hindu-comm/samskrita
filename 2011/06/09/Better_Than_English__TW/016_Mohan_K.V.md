ahamahamika is a great find. It's nice how *mamakaara* has a completely different meaning!

  

One of the nicest names of a book I've seen is that of the first dictionary of the Kannada language: 'shabda-mani-darpaNa'."the bejewelled mirror of words"or "the mirror for (inspecting) words like jewels".I am totally taken on the mirror part and how apt it is for a dictionary.
