Hi,

  

There's a blog, [Better Than English](http://betterthanenglish.com/), that collects complex words from other languages that have no easy translations in English. I'm sure Sanskrit has tons of such words, though my vocabulary is too small to give examples. For our own entertainment, I thought of creating a thread for this.

  

What do you think are the most beautiful,untranslatablewords/phrases/elegantly expressed ideas you know in Sanskrit?

  

Let me start off. One nice untranslatable verse I know is:

  

manasyekam vachasyekam karmaNyekam durAtmanAm

manasyekam vachasyekam karmaNyekam sadAtmanAm

  

("The evil man has one thing on his mind, another in word and another in deed; The noble man has the (same) thing in his mind, word and deed"; 'ekam' has a very nuanced meaning that is impossible to translate)
