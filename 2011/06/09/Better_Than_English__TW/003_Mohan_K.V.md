Excellent! Thanks, I do hope more people contribute.

  

One of my favorite words is 'tAratamya', meaning "inequality" or "partiality". 'tara' and 'tama' are the suffixes for the comparative and superlative (equivalent to '-er' and '-est'). So it literally translates to "-er -est ness", or the state of comparing, or inequality :-)
