Namaste,

  

I am trying to get the word to word meaning of Brahmarpanam shloka (Bhojanamantra that we use). I put together below guessed translation using my own limited knowledge. Please correct me or point me to where I can go to get the pada vichcheda, padaanyasa, etc. Please help.

  

  

**Brahmarpanam**--> Offer to brahman -->*implied verb Karomi may be there*  
**Brahmahivih**-> Offering is brahman -->*Havis is the offering; I think it is in prathama vibhakti here (Subject) - Food we are about to eat is the havis and it is Brahma*  
**Brahmagnou**-->*this is in saptami vibhakti which means "into the fire"; Brahma Himself is the fire;*  
**Brahmnahutam**-->*brahmanaH + aahutam --> brahmanaH is in Shashti vibhakti which means Brahma's ahutam; what belongs to Brahma*  
**Brahmaiva tena gantavyam**-->*This is the passive sentence;The word tena refers to 'that' - I am assuming it is food - the havis;It is supposed to go back to brahma only; hope I am correct;*  
**Brahmakarma Samadheenam**-->*Brahma + karma; Brahma's work; samadhinam is in shashTi vibhakti; 'of samadhi' ; not sure what it is trying to say there; is it the arpana (offering) of Samadhi?*
