Namaste,



 Vasishtha, Rama's Guru, is a part of recorded history.



 Vedas existed before both of them, are a-historical (and 'apauruSheya').

Therefore, it would stand to reason that Vasishtha to whom the Veda was revealed (not 'composed')is different than the one referred to in Ramayana.



 I would not seek for further references.





Regards,
