Namaste!

I came across the following dilemma while looking at Rigvedic king  
lists. The Vasishtha (composer of Mandala 7) is a Rishi of King Sudas  
(as is Vishvamitra of Mandala 3). Sudas is a contemporary of Purukutsa  
of the Ikshvaku dynasty. Now Vasishtha is also the guru of Rama, whom  
the puranas place several generations after Purukutsa. Now are these  
two Vasishthas different? If not, there is contradiction as stated  
above.

What do the puranas/brahmanas say about this? Please reply with references.
