Dear Sirs,



I am in search of various commentaries of saparyaahrdaya attributed to Sankaracharya.



In my limited knowledge, it is written in seven verses.

there is a commentary Uparaagaprakaasika by name written in verses by an anonymous (?)scholar. Godavarma Raja of Kerala has written a prose commentary on this Uparaagaprakaasika.



I would like to know more of these works and other commentaries and translations available on this saparyaahrdaya. Publication details are also needed, if these are published.



I request the learned scholars to help me in locating these works.



Thanking you,

Dr.Sangamesan, K.M
