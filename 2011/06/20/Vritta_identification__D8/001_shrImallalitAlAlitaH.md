Nice.  
Thanks for sharing.  
But, link provided by you was giving error.  
I've checked it. This is the [correct link](http://bit.ly/kG5XaY).  
You don't need to go for la and gU.  
Just put whole shloka in Kyoto-Harvard System as shown on [this page](http://bit.ly/mGackT).  
I put this shloka :  
  
yasmAdbhiyeva manasA saha vaidikI vAk  
dUre caratyamumathApi tadekabhAvA ।  
AnandabodhaghanamekamazeSayoniM  
saMsUcayatyahamimaM nRhariM prapadye ।।  
  
and after pressing the small un-labeled button on it's right, I got  
  
यस्माद्भियेवमनसासहवैदिकीवाक्दूरेचरत्यमुमथापितदेकभावा  
आनन्दबोधघनमेकमशेषयोनिंसंसूचयत्यहमिमंनृहरिंप्रपद्ये  
  
and it's name  
  

[TABLE]

Hope it helps.
