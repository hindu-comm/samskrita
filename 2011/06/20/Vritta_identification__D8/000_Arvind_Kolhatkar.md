Dear Group,  
  
I discovered by chance that the site  
  
<http://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Chanda/src/formChanda.py/searchChanda>  
  
is a very good resource for identifying meters of verses. (The site  
also has quite a lot about grammar too in it.) It has listed 1352  
meters and these have been further classified to aid a search. There  
is also a tool to identify the meter of a verse. By trial and error I  
have devised the following method to use this tool.  
  
In the space provided and using copy/paste I put in 68 syllables, with  
la for लघु and gU for गुरु, as  
  
gUgUgU gUlala lalala gUgUla gUgUla gUgU gUgUgU gUlala lalala gUgUla  
gUgUla gUgU gUgUgU gUlala lalala gUgUla gUgUla gUgU gUgUgU gUlala  
lalala gUgUla gUgUla gUgU  
  
and clicked ‘search’ and the tool threw up as the answer  
मन्दाक्रान्ता.  
  
Next I entered the search string  
  
gUgUla gUgUla lagUla gUlagU gUgUla gUgUla lagUla gUlagU gUgUla gUgUla  
lagUla gUlagU gUgUla gUgUla lagUla gUlagU  
  
and came up with an obscure vritta called इन्दुवंशा, which is almost  
similar to the more well-known वंशस्थ, except that the first syllable  
for वंशस्थ is la and for इन्दुवंशा gU.  
  
I found that the tool requires entering la gU equivalents of all  
syllables of the verse, and not just one pada or line.
