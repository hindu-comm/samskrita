Dear Group,

In the verse

बुभुक्षितैर्व्याकरणं न भुज्यते  
पिपासितैः काव्यरसो न पीयते।  
न च्छन्दसा केनचिदुद्धृतं कुलं  
सुवर्णमेवार्जय निष्फला गुणाः॥

a doubt was raised as to which of these two variants, न च्छन्दसा or न  
छन्दसा , is correct. The verse as I know it has न च्छन्दसा in it.  
As to the grammar rule for this, I found the following observation in  
Whitney’s Grammar as Rule 227 on p. 72:

‘As a general rule, ch is not allowed by grammarians to stand in that  
form after a vowel, but is to be doubled, becoming ccha.’

I request experts to throw more light on this question.

(Whitney’s Grammar is available at  
<http://books.google.com/books?id=7QJgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false>  
).

This creates yet another problem in its wake. न छन्दसा fits with the  
meter of the verse, which, I believe is वंशस्थ (4 padas of 12 letters  
each, arranged as लगुल गुगुल लगुल गुलगु). The version न च्छन्दसा adds  
one more matra to the third line making it गुगुल गुगुल लगुल गुलगु.  
Yet no difficulty is encountered in reciting it as a part the full  
verse. Is there any explanation for this anomaly?

I found that there is another - and, to me, so far unknown – meter  
called इन्दुवंशा. It is almost identical with वंशस्थ, except that the  
first letter of every pada of it is गु, i.e., each pada is गुगुल गुगुल  
लगुल गुलगु. The answer to the problem could be that the version न  
च्छन्दसा almost imperceptibly changes the meter for the third line  
from वंशस्थ to इन्दुवंशा. (How I located this meter is the subject of  
another posting from me.)

Any comments on this?
