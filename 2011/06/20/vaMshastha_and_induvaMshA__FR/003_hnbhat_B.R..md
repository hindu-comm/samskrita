It could be a argument for argument's sake. I have read that considering श्लोकपादः पदम्, the rule संहितैकपदे नित्या makes the external सन्धि between the words in a श्लोकपाद obligatory and the other way is to comment it according to अन्वयक्रमः or आकाङ्क्षाक्रमः both of which are free domain for the clause वाक्ये सा विवक्षामपेक्षते। for clarity.

  

The other excuse would be

  

अपि माषं मषं कुर्यात् छन्दोभङ्गं न कारयेत्।

  

which would free it छन्दोभङ्गदोष. After long vowels, the tuk is optional, either external or internal sandhi.

  

If otherwise justified metrical construction, no need to resort "visandhi" which is a poetic blemish too.
