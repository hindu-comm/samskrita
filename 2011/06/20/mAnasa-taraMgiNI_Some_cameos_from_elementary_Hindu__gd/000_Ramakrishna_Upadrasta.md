namaste,

Here is a nice conversation from between shiva and paaravati from  
"mAnasa-taraMgiNI", (a fascinatingly scholarly blog I follow).

I highly recommend sanskrit and cultural enthusiasts to the entire index at  
<http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/the-complete-index/>

I have spent entire weekends reading the entries from the index. Here  
is one more great entry  
<http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/the-mandala-graph-for-rishi-sharing/>

Note: please read the blog only if you are open to the truth being  
said as it is (without any liberal bias:).

My namaskaarams to the blog author whoever he is.  
namaste  
Ramakrishna
