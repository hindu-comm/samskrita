The Vaishnavaite version of the same wrod game is here:



कोऽयं द्वारि? हरि: प्रयाह्युपवनं शाखामृगस्यात्र किम्!  
कृष्णोऽहं दयिते बिभेमि सुतरां कृष्णादहं वानरात्॥  
मुग्धेऽहं मधुसूदन: पिब लतां तामेव तन्वीं अले  
इत्थं निर्वचनीकृतो दयितयाह्रीतो हरि: पातु व:॥  
  

>   
> > This is the background link: Radha is waiting for Krishna eagerly. > But  
> Krishna does not appear . While Radha is feeling dejected as well > angry and  
> eager to have a chance for taking lovely revenge, she hears the > hitting  
> sound at the door.  
> > \`\`Who is at door?’’ \`\`Hari’’. \`\`Go  forest. Being a monkey, > what the  
> business you have here?’’  
> > (Hari means Vishnu and monkey )  
> > \`\`Hi, beloved, I am Krishna’’ \`\`If so, I panic when I see a > black  
> monkey’’.  
> > (Here Krishna means black. In the first conversation Radha makes > Krishna a  
> monkey. In this second reply she makes him black monkey!)  
> > \`\`O innocent, I am called Madhusudana’’ \`\`O bee, go to the same > creeper to  
> suck nectar’’.  
> > (Madhusudana has two meanings: 1.The slayer of the demon > Madhu=Vishnu.2 The  
> sucker of flower-nectar=bee. )  
> > May Hari who made  \*nirvachana\*(1.subject to tricky word > derivation2,  
> speechless ) and ashamed by Radha protect you.  
> > \[Radha kindles Krishna when he tries to self introduce by using > different  
> names.\]  





And a more similar one is here:



pun.  
अङ्गुल्या कः कवाटं प्रहरति कुटिले माधवः किं वसन्तो  
नो चक्री किं कुलालो न हि धरणिधरः किं द्विजिह्वः फणीन्द्रः ।  
नाहं घोराहिमर्दी किमसि खगपतिर्नो हरिः किं कपीन्द्रः  
इत्येवं गोपकन्या प्रतिवचनजितः पातु वः चक्रपाणिः ॥  

> radha- who taps the door with the finger?  
> krishna- I am madhava here.  
> (the word madhava also means cupid or manmatha or vasantha)  
> Radha- is that vasantha?  
> Krishna – I am the one with the chakra or wheel.  
> Radha- then are u kulaala or the potter? (potter also has wheels)  
> Krishna- no I am the one who carry this world (dharanee dharah)  
> Radha – are you the two tongued serpent king? (it is beleived that > adisesa carries this world)  
> Krishna – I am ghora ahi mardi or the killer of snake (ahi means > snake)  
> Radha – are you the king of birds or khagapati ? ( that is garuda)  
> Krishna – no I am Hari( the word hari also means monkey)  
> Radha – are you the monkey? >
> oh let the lord who was won by radha in the conversation protect us.
