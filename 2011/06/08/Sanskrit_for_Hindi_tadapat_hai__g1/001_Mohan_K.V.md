If you're looking for 'tremble' or 'shiver', some possibilities could be 'kampana', 'udvega', 'seedana' or 'vepathu'. Do note that certain phrases - like 'tadapta dil' - may not translate directly into Sanskrit. Do check out verses [1.28](http://vedabase.net/bg/1/28/)and [1.29](http://vedabase.net/bg/1/29/) in the Bhagavad Gita - the source of the emotion is likely not the same in your case, but the description may be of help :-)
