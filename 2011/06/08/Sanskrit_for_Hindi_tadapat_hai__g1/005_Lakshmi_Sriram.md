There are bound to be usages of such expressions in theAshtapadi-s of Jayadeva. Can't think of examples rightaway, but even acursory look at the translations will give leads.

Tadapna has unique connotations, associations. For instance, the image thatimmediately comes to mind is that of a fish when out of water. In fact that may be the primary usage of the word tadapna which is then metaphorically applied in cases of viraha...
