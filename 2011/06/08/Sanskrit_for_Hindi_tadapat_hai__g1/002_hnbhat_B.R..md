I do not know the exact meaning of the idiomatic phrase in Hindi, but it seems to be anonomatopoeic word imitating the heart beat in excitement. May not be possible to find equivalent expression in Sanskrit, except तडतडायते etc. similaronomatopoeic usage, but it cannot idiomatically convey the exact meaning in Hindi. उत्कण्ठते मे चेतः is idiomatic usage in Sanskrit which can translate roughly the idea of the Hindi expression. उन्मनायते also can be used for the purpose, but these literary usages are notonomatopoeic words as in Hindi.
