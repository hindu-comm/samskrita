Respected Bhat Sir,  
May I refer to what you have so nicely said in your mail, namely, I quote:  
I do not know the exact meaning of the idiomatic phrase in Hindi, but it seems to be an onomatopoeic word imitating the heart beat in excitement. May not be possible to find equivalent ex-pression in Sanskrit, except तडतडायते etc. similar onomatopoeic usage, but it cannot idiomatically convey the exact meaning in Hindi.  
Unquote  
  
Since most known Sanskrit verbs cannot idiomatically convey the exact meaning in Hindi (perhaps due difference in cultural semantics,and since such usages have become part of our younger generation's common usage today, would it be considered an affront on Sanskrit if we innovate an onomatopoeic verb here?  
Regards...Shreyas

If you're looking for 'tremble' or 'shiver', some possibilities could be 'kampana', 'udvega', 'seedana' or 'vepathu'. Do note that certain phrases - like 'tadapta dil' - may not translate directly into Sanskrit. Do check out verses 1.28and 1.29 in the Bhagavad Gita - the source of the emotion is likely not the same in your case, but the description may be of help :-)
