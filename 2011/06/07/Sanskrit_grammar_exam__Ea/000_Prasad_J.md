Dear Members,  
  
I have studied Sanskrit grammar thoroughly but I do not have any certificate for it. Is there any exam affiliated to any recognized university like Pune, where I can get graduate degree only in Sanskrit grammar? I do not want to attend their course as of now, as that will be just redundant. I just want to take their exam. Please help me.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad.
