Thanks for the wise clarification. In sampat kumar it would mean a son flying together.

These are additional meanings:

  

## Meanings

-   to alight on -   to arrive at -   to come to pass -   to encounter -   to fly along

-   to fly or fall down

-   to fly or rush together (in a friendly or hostile manner)

-   to fly to

-   to go or roam about

-   to happen -   to hasten towards -   to meet any one (acc.) -   to meet with (instr.) -   to occur -   to reach (acc. or loc.) -   to take place

for the verb. But I could not find a participle word or substantive word derived from the verb as raised in the first question in the dictionary ending with "t".The word "sampad" is derived from sam+pad (4th conj.) with the suffix kvip, resulting in a particple ending with the consonant "d" as per the rule*सम्पदादिभ्यः*क्विप् वक्तव्यः । a vArtika under (पा-३,३.१०८).
