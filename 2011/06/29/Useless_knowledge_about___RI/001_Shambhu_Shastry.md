The second link Arvind ji gave takes us to ancient Indian mathematicians and references to their treatises in Samskritam. The concept and use of π (without this symbol) was very much present in Samskrita works. (This may have been discussed in the Group before I joined.) Below are three examples:



One of baudhAyana shulbasUtra approximations used in making the homa kundas (\~ 800 BC): π = 900/289 = 3.114:[http://www.gap-system.org/\~history/Biographies/Baudhayana.html](http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Baudhayana.html)



chaturadhikaM shatamaShTaguNaM dvAShaShTistathA sahasrANAm AyutadvayaviShkambhasyAsanno vr^ttapariNahaH \[AryabhatIya, gaNita pAda, 10\]: π = 62,832/20,000 = 3.1416



Madhava’s series approximation (\~1400 AD; later and now equivalent to Gregory’s series): π = 3.[14159265359](tel:(415)%20926-5359) from the series expansion of π/6 in terms of tan(π/6) polynomial:

This is continuation of the π tradition in India, but not in Samskritam: S. Ramanujan’s ruler and compass construction of ‘squaring the circle’ (1913): π = 355/113, π⁴ = 9² + 19²/22:
