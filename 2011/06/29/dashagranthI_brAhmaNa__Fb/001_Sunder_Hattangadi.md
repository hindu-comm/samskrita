This is one definition I came across:



<http://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/article/correct-way-of-chanting-vedic-mantras.html#2>



The ten holy texts

> 
> > ‘The *Sanhitas*, *Brahmans*, *Padakram*, *Aranyaks*, *Shiksha*, > *Chanda*, *Jyotish*, *Nighantu*, *Nirukta* and *Ashtadhyayi* > constitute the ten holy texts (*dashagrantha*). The *Aranyaks* are not > considered a part of the *Brahman* texts, but are endowed with a > separate status. Similarly the *Nighantu* and *Nirukta* are considered > as two separate holy texts. Vyadi has named these ten holy texts > differently as - the *Sanhitas*, *Brahmans*, *Aranyaks*, *Shiksha*, > *Kalpa*, *Ashtadhyayi*, *Nighantu*, *Nirukta*, *Chanda* and *Jyotish*. > As Vyadi has described these ten holy texts the tradition of their > study dates back to the ancient times.’⁽⁸⁾ *Brahmans* (priests) well > versed in the recitation of the ten holy texts are called > *Dashagranthi Brahmans*. >
