Thanks Sunder for the enlightening on the term of dashagranthi. A glance of the constituents of the ten texts, provided from two sources some common feature can be seen:

  

1\. Of the Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka, as the main compilations, the accessories of Veda (6) are included to make the number ten.

  

2\. In both the Vedanga-s constituents are split to complete the number. separating nighantu from nirukta (which is in fact considered as the commentary on the Nighantu) making the number into 7 + 3 in the definition of Vyadi.

  

3\. In the first, Kalpa is replaced by Padakrama text. Otherwise, all the same list.

  

The later text is popular in Kerala, as I have seen many manuscripts of the same in palm leaf. But not sure of the contents than a guess that regulation of the recitation Pada- and Krama paatha-s. It is not explained in the articles too. Or may be the text of the Samhita arranged in Pada, and krama recitation. Any information will be enlightening.  

  

Thanks for Arvindji for raising the issue.
