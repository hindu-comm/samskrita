Dear Group,

  

In Marathi, and perhaps in other Indian languages too, a learned Brahmin is calledदशग्रन्थी ब्राह्मण. I was wondering what these '10 books' are. Could they be the 4 Vedas and the six Shastras? But then, Shastras are not books by themselves. And are UpaniShads and other important books not included? The main Vedas are 3 and not 4.

  

I am sure learned members can throw light on the meaning of this phrase.
