Out of curiosity, I looked up Sayanabhashya for this part. At the outset, I will mention that I am no expert.  
  
The padapATha for this mantra reads as follows:  
  
yat vAk vadantI avichetanAni rAShTrI devAnAM niShasAda mandrA chatasraH UrjaM duduhe payAMsi kva svit asyAH paramaM jagAma  
  
Quoting bhAShya text for some of the words:  
rAShTrI = rAjanashIlA  
avichetanAni = vij\~JAna-rahitaana-praj\~JAtAna-narthAn  
vadantI  
...  
payAMsi = (tatkAraNabhUtAni) udakAni ...  
  
Two points to note here:  
- Griffith's translation is not too objectionable because avichetanAni can be reasonably translated as "uttering words which no one comprehended / understood", while keeping well within the spirit of Sayana's take on it. Please look at the "vij\~JAnarahitAn .. anarthAn above.  
  
- payAMsi = udakAni = water = drink  
  
Incidentally it is not vadanti, but vadantI with a dIrgha svara at the end. So it is shatranta, not in laT.  
  
  
I fail to see what is objectionable in the translation here.  
  
-Naresh  
  
PS: If you are suspicious of English translation and more trusting of Indian language translations, the following is the Kannada version as given in the book:  
" .... mAnavara praj\~Jege arthavAgadantaha vAkkugaLannu uchcharisuttA ... annavannU udakavannU karedaLu (duduhe)...."
