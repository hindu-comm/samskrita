NAMASKAR TO ALL GROUP

the above verse from well known SRI SUKTA - i am not going to criticise about its particular leaning - i just want to say that one should translate this verse with ' PURVAAPAR' mantras,

we are not the MANTRA DRASTAAS so we should try to evaluate with PURVAAPAR mantras.

i will be happy from the guidance from all learned group please,
