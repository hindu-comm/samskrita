I think it is pronounced as such in Taittiriya only and before the consonant स as one will have anusvaara in its pure form without undergoing any change. In some of other thread, the symbol for this type of anusvAra is presented in some other thread. It is pronounced as "g" appended though it is represented ardhachandra with anusvara mounted on
a half visarga like symbol in Devanagari. But for listeners, "g_M" is heard. हंसः शुचि,,,,, etc. ऋतं सत्यं परं etc. are the mantra-s I have heard and not before other consonants so far as I remember. Also taGm hovaaca. It might have been prescribed in यजुःप्रातिशाख्य accurately.
