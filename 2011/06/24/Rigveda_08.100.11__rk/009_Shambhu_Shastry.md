Naresh mahodaya,

  

Certainly. Just so any member is not confused, I may add:

  

In the context of the two mantras (#10 and 11) as well as the entire sUktam 8-100 and its contextualization in the taittirIya brAhmaNa 2-8-8, there is no water, milk, or drink in its purview. So Griffith's translation is really fantastic. These days most may go further with payas = pAyasam (a sweet dish; 'paayasa' in Kannada) and look for the meaning in the bhojanam, though!
