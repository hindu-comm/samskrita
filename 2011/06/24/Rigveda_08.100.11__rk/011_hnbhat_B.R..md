I am not in a possition to understand the explanation of Sayana, in as much as



अविचेतनानि वदन्ती - विज्ञानरहितान् अप्रज्ञातार्थान्वदन्ती ,,,



whether the word अविचेतनानि - is substantive noun in neuter gender which is explained in masculine gender as meaning less sounds/voices/words without any obvious meaning. If it is adjective, it requires a noun to be qualified which is not in the mantra, but inferred as वचांसि, which is not included in the gloss also. The second word in feminine gender of present participle of वद as suggestedby Naresh.



The gloss inSayana in its turn is based on thegloss given by Yaska on the same mantra,asअविज्ञातानि for अविचेतनानि (निरुक्त ११.२८) which is further elaborated as अप्रज्ञातार्थान्. Any enlightenement in this respect is highly solicited.



According to the translators, the word here denotes the माध्यमिका वाक् sound produced in the sky as proposed in Nirukta in the same context. Here it signifies the मन्द्र sound produced by the lightening, with the adjective राष्ट्री = राजनशीला, i.e. lightening conceived as the वाक् and it is metaphorical idea is the rain produced by the rain producing liquit and solid food for all ऊर्जं दुदुहे पयांसि which is the proper meaning for the verb दुह प्रपूरणे.



The same idea is explained in the next verse also, where the next section in Nirukta as related to the deity वाक् in the दैवतकाण्ड explains \[इषमूर्जम् दुहाना\] - अन्नं रसं च दुहाना. (निरुक्त ११.२९)(both are commented to some extent).



In both places, the rain falling from the sky is conceived as milk, water or food differently or bothfood and waterprovided by naure and hence conceived as provided by the वाग्देवता.



By the way, both इषम् and ऊर्क् are listed as synonyms of food in निघण्टु by Yaska. Hence he has used different forms of food, अन्नम् रसं च in his gloss on इषम्, ऊर्जम्.



Both are derived from इष इच्छायाम्, and ऊर्ज बल-प्राणनयोः, respectively. The second may be ऊर्ज also derived from क suffix. meaningproviding energy. In the other the same has been interpreted with पयांसि which can be taken in the above explanation meaning both milk or water or anyliquid food रस (which is also sysnonym for food in the निघण्टु).



But the translation by "drink" for the liquid food or रस may lead to some different connotation in English need not transfer the meaning of रसin Sanskrit. This the problem with its usage in different contexts in English languagewhich overshadowsliteral meaning thatany liquid that can be drunk.In the context of यज्ञ or याग it may mean even meat and drink as हुतशेष in it for the Rtvik-s. Soma Juce and meat of the पशु (or anything offered as oblation)sacrificed in the याग. This also might have influenced their translations as Brahmnins are हुतशेषादः entitled for it while others are not, according to Aitereya Brahmana.
