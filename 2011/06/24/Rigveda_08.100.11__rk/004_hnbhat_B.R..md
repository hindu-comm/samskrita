You have rightly assessed value of the semantic content of the Vedic verses. It has been stated many and the tradition has fixed a संहितापाठ and पदपाठ to fix the words in the verse and the identification of the words in the संहितापाठ i.e.Versified form. In Additioln, वेदाङग-s OR Accessories to the संहिता-s of which व्याकरण, छन्दः, and निरुक्त (A etymologically annotated words of the vocabulary of Vedic Words called निघण्टु) are aides to understand the meaning. This is the traditional way of interpreting the मन्त्र-s in the वेदसंहिता-s. It has been clearly specified in निरुक्तम्-

  

नैकं पदं निर्ब्रूयात् - A word should be commented in isolation (from its context).

  

This has been followed by the traditional commentators like सायणाचार्य and his predecessors. I am trying to gather information according to सायण-s commentary and will post it soon.
