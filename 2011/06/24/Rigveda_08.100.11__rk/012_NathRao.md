Actually, "gm" (or sometimes "gum") for anusvAra is a pronunciation of  
anusVara in certain traditions (like "j" for "y" etc). I am not sure  
if it is confined to just Taittiriyas (or even only some of them) or  
if it is more widespread. It was not universal: RkprAtishAkya, I  
believe, considers it unacceptable.
