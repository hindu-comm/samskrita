This is very interesting. Thanks for both providing different types of Shlesha.

  

But the first is a remake of the popular verse with the same content, but used in a less effective and explicit way:

  

अनुरागवती सन्ध्या दिवसस्तत्पुरःसरः।

अहो दैवगतिश्चित्रा! तथापि न समागमः॥

  

The same is conveyed by way of a lucid suggestion by the adjectives only. This is called समासोक्ति figure of speech supported by the श्लेष in the same word अनुराग. But the image is the same, but differently presented. Instead of wondering at the destiny that separated them, he used the same image, to wonder at the feminine mind which makes her to follow her lover, in spite of being reject. The first needs no effort on the part of reader, while the second does need some more effort. The second type is called शेलेषमूलकालंकारध्वनिः when the pun lies in the word for उपमान itself being suggested by the adjectives: carrying very simple adjectives applicable to both. Here is another one beautiful verse I liked for ever I learnt it:

  

दत्तानन्दाः प्रजानां समुचितसमयाकृष्टसृष्टैः पयोभिः

पूर्वाह्णे विप्रकीर्णाः दिशि दिशि विरमत्यह्नि संहारभाजः।

दीप्तांशोर्दीर्घदुःखप्रभव-भव-भयोदन्वदुत्तारनावो

गावो वः पावनानां परमपरिमितां प्रीतिमुत्पादयन्तु॥ (सूर्यशतक

  

Here शब्दश्लेष in the word गावः = rays of the son and the cows makes the beautiful अर्थश्लेष to complete the comparison between the two. Another instance of the same, with व्यतिरेक  -

  

नो कल्पापायवायोरदयरयदलत्क्षामधारस्यापि गम्या

गाढोद्गीर्णोज्ज्वलश्रीरहनि न रहिता नो तमःकज्जलेन।

प्राप्तोत्पत्तिः पतङ्गान्न पुनरुपगता मोषमुष्णत्विषो वो

वर्तिः सैवान्यरूपा शमयतु **निखिलद्वीपदीपस्य दॊप्तिः।** ****    

  

The comparison between the wick of the unique lamp for lighting the whole of the earth and the ordinary lamp.

  

The contrast and comparison is done by applying the same adjectives with the difference hinted by na with each adjective.

  

I have not given translation as the first needs no translation and the second needs only certain amount of more imagination.

  

If wanted, I will post in my next.
