Thanks Ramakrishnanji. It is indeed a beautiful verse.

To the extent I can make out slesha is as follows;

जनस्थाने,जन+स्थाने;कनकमृग+तृष्णा,कनक+मृगतृष्णा:वैदेही,वै+देहि;कुशलव+सुता,कुशल+वसु+ता.

श्लेष can arise in two different ways.1) by splitting words differently and 2) using words which have multiple meanings. The above falls into the first category.

Speaking of Slesha, why not look at the following of Valmiki?

चञ्चच्चन्द्रकरस्पर्शहर्षोन्मीलिततारका।

अहो रागवती संध्या जहाति स्वयमम्बरम् ।

Regards
