I have attached the standard published English Translation of the  
verses with their notes on the verses No.9 and No.23 of the सूर्यशतक  
in the attached files.

Both are beautifully explained with reference to the cows and the  
rays, parallelly along with the lines of the text. The notes to them  
are also informative.

अनुरागवती सन्ध्या दिवसस्तत्पुरःसरः।  
अहो दैवगतिश्चित्रा! तथापि न समागमः॥

Here the श्लेष gives rise to an image of a lovingheroine following  
the hero but never they meet. The image emerges from the use of the  
feminine and masculine Genders for सन्ध्या and दिवस, supported by the  
श्लेष in the word अनुराग redness and loving. The suggestion here is  
made subject to the support of the general statement in the second  
half. Otherwise, it is a class ध्वनिकाव्य. In the image is used  
explicitly as श्लेष and with less charm explaining in otherplain  
words the sameidea.

Hope the attached files are readable online.
