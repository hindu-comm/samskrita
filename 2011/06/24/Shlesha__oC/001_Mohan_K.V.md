Excellent! Btw, is there a way this meter (if it all it is set to one) is to be correctly recited?

  

I don't know if these can be called arthazleSa, but I found them very interesting and am posting. Bana's Kadambari is chock full of constructions of the form,

  

"like X, he is Y"

  

where Y has a double meaning (Y1 and Y2), with Y1 describing the quality X has and Y2 the quality the person in question has.

  

Examples:

  

(describing King Shudraka in the very beginning)

  

raviH iva prati-divasa-upajAyamAna-udayaH ("like the Sun, he rose/grew in stature every day"; Y1 == udaya meaning simply rise, while Y2 == udaya meaning grow)

  

(berating lakSmI in the celebrated Zukanasopadeza)

  

hiDimbA iva bhIma-sAhasaika-hArya-hRdayA ("like Hidimba, her heart can only be won by (the efforts of Bhima)/(extreme effort)", Y1 == efforts of Bhima, Y2 = extreme effort)
