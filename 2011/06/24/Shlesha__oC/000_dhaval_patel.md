Hi all,

I was reading a book called kalAvilAsa bu kShemendra.

I found this verse particularly attractive and the thought seemed very fresh:

  

त्यक्ताऽपि प्रतिदिवसं दिवसद्युतिरनुजगाम दिवसकरम्‌ ।

रक्ता - interested / red...

  

The learned members may also throw up examples of arthshleSha which touched them the most..
