Dear Group,

This thread started with the श्लोक

त्यक्ताऽपि प्रतिदिवसं दिवसद्युतिरनुजगाम दिवसकरम् ।  

न तु रक्ताऽपि हि संध्या हृदयं जानाति कः स्त्रीणाम् ॥

and Mohan KV had asked about its meter and how it is to be correctly  
recited.

My immediate answer to this question is that it is in the आर्या  
meter. At least in Marathi poetry, where this meter is used –  
Moropant was very fond of it and much of his voluminous output is in  
this meter – it is defined as having 2 lines and 4 पादs, the first and  
the third पादs being of 12 मात्राs, the second of 18 मात्राs and the  
fourth of 15 मात्राs., its लक्षणश्लोक, as I know it, being:

यस्याः प्रथमे पादे द्वादश मात्रास्तथा तृतीयेऽपि।  
अष्टादश द्वितीये चतुर्थके पञ्चदश साऽऽर्या॥

The श्लोक that is the subject of this thread, agrees with it and so  
does, for example, the following श्लोक from शाकुन्तलम्:

गच्छति पुरः शरीरं धावति पश्चादसंस्थितं चेतः।  
चीनांशुकमिव केतोः प्रतिवातं नीयमानस्य॥

Yet, I have also read that the Sanskrit meter आर्या-गीति is not quite  
the same as the Marathi आर्या. Through Google I came across the  
following description of आर्या-गीति at <http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)>  
and it takes a different tack altogether:

\<While the above uses a fixed number of syllables, a different type of  
metre uses a fixed total length, counting a long syllable as equal to  
two short. For example, the metre known as giti or old arya has a line  
of seven feet plus an odd syllable at the end. A foot consists of two  
long syllables, four short, or a long and two short. The 2nd, 4th and  
6th feet are usually short-long-short, or occasionally short-short-  
short-short. The 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th are anything except the  
former.>

I would like to know the definition of Sanskrit आर्या-गीति and whether  
and how it differs from its Marathi counterpart.
