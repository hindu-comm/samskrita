You have correctly understood and equated with the fondness for Latin in the Classical European Period.

  

The same attitude towards Sanskrit in Kerala, undermining the importance of Malayalam, is ridiculed by this composition. To quote the same assessment of Ullur Mahakavi Parameshvaran,

  

"If you call a lady a pUcca-kaNNi, cat-eyed, she will be annoyed, while
गणपतिवाहननयने will be rejoiced and will be pleased." This was the quote from UllUr Parameshwaran Iyer. Overburdening on Malayalam literature Sanskrit words and structure was resented by the native language poets. This attitude of the time was reflected by this mockery of the Sanskrit structure.
