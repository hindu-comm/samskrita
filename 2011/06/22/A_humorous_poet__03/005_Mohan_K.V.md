I'm not sure I understood that correctly, did you mean that even though the poem pokes fun of the lady being described, she'd still be impressed because it's in Sanskit? :)

  

There's an equivalent in Latin, "Quidquid latine dictum, altum videtur" "Whatever is said in Latin appears profound!"

  

Also, regarding misleading structure and big words that are intended to be misunderstood, there's the classic [Smathers' Redneck Speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Pepper#Red_Accusations_and_hoax_.22Redneck_Speech.22_in_1950):

  

Part of American political lore is the Smathers "redneck speech," which Smathers reportedly delivered to a poorly educated audience. The "speech" was never given; it was a hoax dreamed up by one reporter. (comment: That doesn't make it any less interesting, though)
