Dear Sir,



It is only a pleasure to share our feelings with good oldfriends like you. Here is one more composition of Tolan, the most humorous construction in beautiful Sanskrit Language:



'अर्क्कशुष्कफलकोमलस्तनी

तिन्त्रिणीदलविशाललोचना

निम्बपल्लवसमानकेशिनी  
वृद्धवानरमुखी विराजते\|\|" (Credits to Encycopedia of Malayalam)



The fancy for the use of Sanskrit words in Malayalam is again made fun of with the above description. I think the above doesn't need any commentary. Even though he will be shunned at by the ladies, described as above in Malayalam, on hearing the above Sanskrit structure, he supposes, to have smile over the style of the Sanskrit Composition and will be pleased.





I leave the translation to the members of our group to imagine the ladyfitting the above description to enjoy the above poetry and the similey.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/49808c8aefcf5352/341.png?part=0.2)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/49808c8aefcf5352/33E.png?part=0.1)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/49808c8aefcf5352/33E.png?part=0.1)
