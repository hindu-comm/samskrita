In Kerala there was a poet called Tolan.

He was a nimishakavi and used to

compose numerous humourous poems.

  

He learnt from his teacher how to compose

slokas. 

  

Anvaya - prose order.

  

The sentence in the sloka need not be

in prose oerder. One has to do the

anvaya to find out the meaning.

  

A sloka contains 8 letters in a quarter

or paadam. Sometimes the matter

can be expressed in 7 letters. But

to fulfil the requirement of 8 letters

one can use single letter words like

ch, vai,thu or hi. च, वै, तु, हि.

पादपूरणार्थम्

The same rule applies to longer meters

also.

  

The first composition of Tolan was this

  

उत्थिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ राजेन्द्र !

मुखं प्रक्षाळयस्व ट: /

एष आह्वयते कुक्कु

च वै तु हि च वै तु हि //

  

अन्वयं -

राजेन्द्र ! एष कुक्कुटः आह्वयते /

उत्थिष्ठ, उत्थिष्ट / मुखं प्रक्षाळयस्व //

Other letters are for filling the quarter.
