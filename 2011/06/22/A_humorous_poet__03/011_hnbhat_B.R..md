Right. You are perfectly correct. It is the next one in the line quoted from Ullur.



One can imagine any number of such insulting words with sufficient knowledge of Sanskrit vocabulary and literature.But I am not so rich tofulfill your request. Some tip I can give from technical terminology:

  

जगदादिजपुत्रपुत्र - son a bear!

  

पञ्चमान्यथासिद्धपुत्र  - son of a donkey!

  

etc. But I don't like insulting words using/misusing knowledge of Sanskrit vocabulary.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/a0344d8e476f1277/04D.gif?part=0.2)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/a0344d8e476f1277/360.gif?part=0.3)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/a0344d8e476f1277/360.gif?part=0.3)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/a0344d8e476f1277/360.gif?part=0.3)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/a0344d8e476f1277/338.gif?part=0.1)
