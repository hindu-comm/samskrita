> The version that I have is  
>   
> उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ राजेन्द्र मुखं प्रक्षालयस्व टः।  
> प्रभाते रटते कुक्कु चवैतुहि चवैतुहि॥  
>   



This is another version for the third line as usual:

  

uttishhTha uttishhTha rAjendra mukhaM prakshAlayasva TaH \|  
prabhAte roditI kukku cha vai tu hi cha vai tu hi \|\|  
  
The roditI may be a corrupt form of Arvindji's raTate, which also unusual in its status asरट (परिभाषणे, भ्वादिगण, परस्मैपदी) should be रटति. रोदिती is grammatically wrong, but could be justified for the complying with the metrical requirement. in AnuShTup. Never mind about the meaning or grammar. The very humorous element is in this stanza in the reading of the use of आत्मनेपद in compliance with the requirements of the metre:

  

आह्वयते - एष कुक्कुटः आह्वयते - The cock gives challenging shouts (at the king).

  

which is otherwise take परस्मैपद endings when used in the sense of calling another one, because of the rule "स्पर्धायामाङः" which restricts its meaning to calling sportively.

  

The other reading also I heard which could be proper for the context of the cry of the bird:

  

एष संकूजते कुक्कु

  

but do not give any other meaning, than the grammatical aberration.

  

In all, the poet wanted to make fun of the scholar poets who following the rules of metre, grammar, paadapUraNa, make the verses incomprehensible, using the flexibility of the word order in Sanskrit. I remember one more such verse composed in the excessive use of Manipravala literature, popular in his time, composing poems using both Sanskrit and Malayalam words, with both Sanskrit and Malayalam inflections together. Just I quote a line of them for sample, as the words are Sanskrit:

  

मण्डन्ति पान्थनिवहाः पडिबन्धपेड्या   

  

where मड (verb - to run), पडि(door, gate), पेडि (fear) are malayalam words where as the case inflections are Sanskrit. The compound in the middle is the Sanskrit proper, while the next is a maNipravAla a mixture of Sanskrit and Malayalam, used in Instrumental case. The total meaning of the line is: The crowds of walkers, are running fearing the closure of the doors (as it is late). 

  

With regards
