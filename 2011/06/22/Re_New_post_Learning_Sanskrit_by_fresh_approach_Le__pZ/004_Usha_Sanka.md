Namaste

What is the source of this verse?

उपमा कालिदासस्यभारवेरर्थगौरवम्।  

दण्डिनः****पदलालित्यं माघे सन्ति त्रयो गुणाः ।।  

I checked internet resources but could not find any mention of source anywhere.

Only found the shloka in another discussion in this group.

And-

What is generally done in research papers/articles when certain quote source is not found? Just mention "source not found"?

Thankyou in advance
