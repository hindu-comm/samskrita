What is generally done in research papers/articles when certain quote source is not found? Just mention "source not found"?  

Thankyou in advance

There is nothing wrong, if the source could not be traced and noted as source not traced. Or simply say often quoted verse.

  

Only if the soruce could be traced to any definite source, then only one can note the source correctly. Or the secondary source, if it is found quoted in some other source than the original source.
