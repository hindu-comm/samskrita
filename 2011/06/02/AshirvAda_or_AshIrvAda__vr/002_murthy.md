I have read in a grammar book that for halanth nouns the stem that is seen in triteeyabahuvacana तृतीयाबहवचनः is the one that is used for constructing compound words. In राजपुरुषः, मनोजवः, आशीर्वादः etc राज,मनो,आशीर् are the stems you find in तृतीयाबहुवचन. I would like to get a confirmation that this rule is Paninian.
