There is no such co-relation than internal sandhi form in all the forms quoted and in compounds it is a general rule that the case endings of the first member is lost. No such co-relation can be established with such guesses without support from the original sources.

  

In the present case, the stem isआशिस् and it is the rule (8-2-76) र्वोरुपधाया दीर्घ इकः in compound or declined forms (Even inतृतीया द्विवचन also has got the form आशीः,आशीर्भ्याम् etc.) and it is not a rule that conforms to the Paninian rule that it is related to
तृतीयाबहुवचन even if such a rule is made by a western grammarian. In all other cases too it holds good in dvivacana too in caturthI, and Pancami in all cases the above quoted Paninian rule is applicable.
