I could not confirm anything from your above explanation. There are many rules that can be used to describe the compound forms according to the meaning conveyed by the these words. I short cut was given by Dhaval Patel in SamAsacakra in another topic which generally explains the meaning in short according to their formation.

  

I don't know any such rule with relation to halant words and तृतीयाबहुवचन for compound formation specifically.

  

  

In reply to Arvind's question, another ePandit has replied precisely. It is षष्ठीतत्पुरुष which can be explained as आशिषः वादः - meaning "the utterance of benediction आशिस्. The first member which आशि-स् becomes lengthened as आशी(र्) due to compound formation and sandhi rules and hence आशिर्वाद 

is incorrect according to PANINIAN rules of grammar.
