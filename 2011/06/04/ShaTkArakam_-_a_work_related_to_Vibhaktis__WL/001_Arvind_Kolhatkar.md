Dhaval,

Certainly a laudable effort but I have two minor queries.

Who is the commentator? Is he the composer himself (इहायं कर्ता  
बालव्युत्पत्तये संक्षेपतः संबंधमभिदधानः प्रस्तुवन्नाह)?

What is the correct name of the composer? रभसनन्द makes no meaning.  
Is it रभसानन्द? Again, रभस् is generally not a complimentary word.  
However, MW does indicate रभस as the name of a lexicographer.
