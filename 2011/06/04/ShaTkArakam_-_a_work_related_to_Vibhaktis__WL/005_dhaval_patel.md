Vimala ji,

mArabalaM is correct.

MW says

[TABLE]

Therefore it may be army of mAra..

  

But I also have a query in the mangalacharanam

If we take mArabalam nirjitam, there is no kriyA left for bhavapanYjaram...

Is it possible that nirjitam refers to both mArabalam andbhavapanYjaram???

Is it grammatically possible?
