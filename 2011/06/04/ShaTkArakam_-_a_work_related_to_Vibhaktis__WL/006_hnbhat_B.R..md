Nagnam can be adjective for mArabalam, meaning naked or explicit platoon of mAra-s (4 enumerated by MW), which ideologically represents the cage of birth.

  

The life=cycle. is nothing but the explicit form of the 4 mAra-s, which was conquered by Buddha, which episode is popular in his poetic biographies and also evident by his epithet *mArajit* as given by Amara in his lexicon.

  

Hence there is no need to wrangle with the problem of whether it refers to Gautama Buddha or avatAra-buddha or mahAvIra Jina.

  

nagna as masculine noun, is of course, synonym of kSapaNaka, but it does not fit well in the syntactic order in a poetic style.

  

As participle, nagna can be taken as the mArabalaM is revealed and the bhava-panjara is conquered as cause and effect sequence also can explain the syntax well without taking the first word to mean kSapaNaka or jina mahAvIra.

  

In any case, both Jains and Buddhists have contributed to Sanskrit Grammar by simplifying Paninian grammar. Buddhist grammar, by JaumAranandin, followed by rUpAvatAra of dharmakIrti, long before SiddhAntakaumudi appeared. Of Jains, Hemachandra's Haima vyAkaraNa is popular entitled हैमव्याकरणम् in eight Chapter with the eighth devoted to Prakrit Grammar instead of Vedic Grammar in Paninian System. Both do not deal with Vedic inflections and silent about accentuation system as they have nothing to do with the Vedic Literature. Both have coined their own terminology without understanding which, it would not be possible to explain the text correctly withPaninian terminology. This is true in respect of this guide for kAraka- system also as it appeared in my first reading.

  

Hence I am not adding any comments on the text.
