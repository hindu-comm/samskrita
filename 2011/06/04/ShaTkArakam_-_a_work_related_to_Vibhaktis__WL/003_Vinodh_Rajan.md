//नग्नं मारबलं येन निर्जितं भवपंजरम् ।  
निर्वाणपदमारुढं तं बुद्धं प्रणमाम्यहम् ॥ १ ॥//

  

The author seems to be Jain.

  

Though the author writes.. "Buddham PraNamaami ahaM", the word "Buddha" is used as in the "Awakened one".

  

Bauddhas themselves called the Buddha-s by the epithet, /Jina/ (as in "Victor"). Likewise, the Jaina-s also use (Bauddha) terms such as /Tathaagata/, /Sugata/ as epithets for the Jina-s.

  

(Both the Jaina's and the Bauddha's use similar epithets for the both the Buddha and the Jina)

  

The term "Nagna" clearly identifies the personality invoked is the Jina not the Buddha. In this specific context, the term /Buddha/ is used as an epithet of the /Jina/
