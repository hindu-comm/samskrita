Dear Mr. Arvind



(1)I am not certain about the first query..

The manuscript provides no more information than this..

The google information is 'Rabhasanandi is a digambara jain author'.

I have found this book in a jain bhandar. which confirms that it has something to do with Jain author..

But the mangalacharana is a buddhist one.

Therefore it is absolutely possible that the original author is Buddhist and the commentator is Jain..



But sheerly a work of guess...



(2)As far as the manuscript is concerned it is very clearly written as rabhasananda only.

But as I have mentioned earlier, Mr. H.N. Bhat told me that it is already published in Rajasthan oriental research institute.

That book shows the author as Rabhasanandi..

<http://openlibrary.org/books/OL15340426M/Karaka-sambandhodyota.>

I dont have that book, which would help clarify our doubts.
