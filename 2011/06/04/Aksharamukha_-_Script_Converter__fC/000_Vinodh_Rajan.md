Hi Guys,

  

I have just updated the Script Converter - Aksharamukha, correcting several bugs that I had found out. I have also rehashed the entire options thing, making the interface more simple. I have also updated the Script notes.

As a new addition, Conversion to Urdu Script is also supported.

Do try it out and let me know of any issues faced.

  

Thanks !
