I've heard that it is a tradition in samskrita, to start a new work with a kriyaa padam (and not with kartRu or karma padam). For eg. "asti uttarishyaam dishe".

  

Is there a validity to this notion, or is it only for some specific instances of samskrita literature ?

  

I didnt see this applied to some other works... (raghuvamsha - vaagarthaaviva, shaakuntala - yaa sRuShTi:, shishupaalavadham - shriya: pati).
