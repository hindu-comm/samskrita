While making an attempt to wade through Prof Petersen's paper I found that what is generally called "इत्" \[उपदेशे अन्त्यरूपा हल्वर्णाः इत्संज्ञकाः स्युः\] is consistently referred to as "अनुबन्ध". As per my knowledge "अनुबन्ध" is a flag attached to a धातु to indicate to which list it belongs.Is"इत्" an "अनुबन्ध"?
