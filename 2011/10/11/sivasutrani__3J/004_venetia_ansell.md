Namo namah



I have heard at least one scholar posit the theory that 'hakAra' is an old semi-vowel which corresponds to 'akAra' just as 'yakAra' corresponds to 'ikAra' and 'vakAra' to 'ukAra'. If you look at the order of thetwo relevantsutras this becomes clearer:



a-i-u-N



ha-ya-va-ra-T



What I was told is that this hakAra as a semi-vowel can be seen in other Indo-European languages, or at least its remnants can, and that on that basis and on the basis of the arrangement of the Maheshvarasutras, where hakARa is the only non-it letter that is repeated, we must assume that hakAra was originally a semi-vowel in Sanskrit too. The maheshvara sutras precede Panini so perhaps by his time it was no longer so.



I'd be interested to hear other views' on this theory (and please excuse any mistakes I may have made in stating it, I do not have my notes to hand).



Best,

Venetia
