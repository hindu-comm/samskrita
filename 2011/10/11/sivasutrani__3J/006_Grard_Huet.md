The śivasūtra is not a mere list of phonemes of the language.  
It is a special data structure that represents in a compact way the  
sets of phonemes (nasals, vowels, etc) that are needed to express the  
grammatical rules in Aṣṭādhyāyī.  
Such a set is encoded by an abbreviation called pratyāhāra, consisting  
of a pair of a starting phoneme, and a end marker. The pratyāhāra  
abbreviates the set of phonemes comprised in this interval, markers  
excluded. Thus 'hal' stands for all consonants, 'ac' for vowels, 'zar'  
for sibilants, etc.  
  
The śivasūtra is arranged in a very ingenious way, so that there is  
maximum sharing of the needed subsets. Thus there is almost no  
duplication, only the phoneme 'ha' is repeated.  
The mathematical problem that arises is: "Is this duplication  
necessary?". In other words, is there  
some other listing of the phonemes interspersed with markers such that  
all needed sets of phonemes could be obtained without such a  
repetition? This is the problem that Wiebke Petersen solved, using  
graph theory. She showed that Pāṇini's representation is optimal,  
since at least one phoneme (like 'ha') must be repeated.  
This is a measure of Pāṇini's genius. Pāṇini is not just the first  
linguist recorded in history, he is also the first expert in  
information theory, having coined such ingenious data structures.  
Of course the historical problem remains of who is the actual author  
of the śivasūtra, since Pāṇini may have taken it from a tradition of  
previous grammarians.
