I myself could not understand you question. It is Grammar Text of Panini and I have seen commentaries in Sanskrit which are too much technical to be explained in simple language unless one is ready to undertake a study of Paninian Grammar seriously.

  

Anyhow, I do not see, for practical purpose, the need of two "ह" in any way different in pronunciation in the language. There are defended only purely grammatical functional needs in the elaborate scheme of Panini's अष्टाध्यायी.

  

I have not seen any English Commentary on this portion and somebody would throw light on any commentary you are referring, if you give the precise reference to the commentary in English you are referring. Only on seeing what they have said in this respect, one can simplify it in normal language, I hope who can follow their method of commentary. Please give the bibliographical details of the commentary/commentaries you have referred to so that some scholar would refer to them and explain it in plain English.

  

SC Basu has translated सिद्धन्तकौमुदी also and probably you will find his interpretation following the traditional commentaries and not any European Scholar. It is purely on grammatical purpose, the letter is added twice in the Sutra.

  

Hope someone would through light in this respect.
