All those augmentations to any Sutra or Dhatu are generally referred as अनुबन्ध-s and only those assigned the designation as इत् are elided with some specific purpose. Others are for the convenience of pronunciation. "नानुबन्धकृतमनेकाल्त्वम्" "अनेकान्ता अनुबन्धाः" as these and other refer to the augmentations to Sutra-s as well as the words in the गणपाठ and धातुपाठ and not restricted to धातु-s. In धातु-s the serve multiple purposes, like आत्मनेपद, परस्मैपद and many more functions.
