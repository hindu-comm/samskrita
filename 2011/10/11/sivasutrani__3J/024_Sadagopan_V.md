"........Now the next possible question is - does the entire Ashtadhyayi have optimal information encoding? A related question was raised by Prof Amba Kulkarni during the talk of Dr Pieterson - is there a way to get the order of entire Ashtadhyayi just like order (or one of the possible orders) of the letters for the Shiva Sutras can be derived mathematically?..."  

On this, with childish haste Ibeg to add:



Before any such analysis one should know exactly what was the field like whenAshtadhyayi blossomed. What were the constraints on account of Sanjas, paribhashas, already recognised ganas, dhatupatha etc. existing at that time..? Were there extraneous matters that contribute to the shape of sutras, for example is there a particular way of arrangement of Sutras and words in the sutrasthat willmake iteasy for people (who knew Sanskrit of that time) to memorise and reproduce the sutras
