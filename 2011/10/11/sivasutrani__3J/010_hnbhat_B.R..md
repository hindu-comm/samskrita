This means he could not have avoided the repetition in way and construed the sets including the second "ha"

like रल्, शल्, झल् etc. Commentators tried to show even if he had rephrased these sets, it would create obstacles in the operation of the other sets and would not yield the required forms applying them.

  

Thanks for the explanation.
