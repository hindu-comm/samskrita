Please make it clear with references to the original source.

  

Anyhow, traditional Indian Grammarians do not deal with Indo-European theory of languages and hence they find much difficult in defending the duplication of the "consonant" or semivowel (absent in Sanskrit). Will have to be checked with all the प्रत्याहार-s containing both and try to find any difference in their treatment within the framework of Panini.

  

Some contain the first ह and some the second one through out the text.
