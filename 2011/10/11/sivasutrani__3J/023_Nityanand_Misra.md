A bit late on the thread, but anyway, this was a great thread indeed. Excellent responses by Prof Huet and Shreevatsa. I had the chance to see Prof Huet speak in person at Hyderabad in 2009 at the Third International Symposium on Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, where Dr. Wiebke Pieterson had presented her research.  
  
Indeed, Panini's (or Maheshvara's) entropy encoding in the Shivasutras is optimal. This is perhaps the first known instance of data compression and Paul Kiparsky has even termed the "Panini's Razor" as a stricter form of Occam's Razor in his talk which can be found [here](http://www.stanford.edu/%7Ekiparsky/Papers/paris.pdf). The results of Pieterson and Kiparsky are not entirely new though (this is nothing to take away from their brilliant research and novel approach), for the traditional definition of the सूत्र is  
  
स्वल्पाक्षरमसन्दिग्धं सारवद्विश्वतोमुखम्  
अस्तोभमनवद्यं च सूत्रं सूत्रविदो विदुः  
  
If we take the two qualities together, स्वल्पाक्षर = having very few letters (in other words as few as possible), असन्दिग्ध=unambiguous or precise, we get the Occam's Razor (or a stricter from of it). So since the शिवसूत्र are after all सूत्र, it is no surprise that the information encoding in the sutras is optimal.  
  
Now the next possible question is - does the entire Ashtadhyayi have optimal information encoding? A related question was raised by Prof Amba Kulkarni during the talk of Dr Pieterson - is there a way to get the order of entire Ashtadhyayi just like order (or one of the possible orders) of the letters for the Shiva Sutras can be derived mathematically? These are more challenging questions, one has to prove that the anuvrittis (अनुवृत्ति)s are maximized with the current order of sutras, and that the number of nouns (संज्ञाs) used are optimal, and a host of other things - I don't know if anybody has done any research on this or not.  
  
Another interesting thing to ponder over. A question I asked Dr Pieterson was if we consider the "a" sound in the laN (लण्) sutra to be another anubandha, would the analysis and the conclusions change? The "a" in laN is to be considered anunaasika to get the pratyahara र (ra), which makes words like तवल्कारः (tavalkAraH) possible from उरण् रपरः. Though not agreed to be Nagesh Bhatta, the existence of words like तवल्कारः and opinions of several other scholars makes me believe that the र pratyahara does exist. I don't know what analysis of Kiparsky and Pieterson would yield, but I think no, because the extra anunaasika anubandha leads to a compression of the code at the cost of an extra marker, so overall entropy of the system is the same with one use of the code. In other words, र् and ल् can also be referred to by the code (प्रत्याहार) रण् which is longer than the code र which we get with the anunasika a in लण् as anubandha. With more than one usages of the code, the shorter code and one extra marker have less entropy than the longer code and one less marker.  
  
Finally, assuming both Shiva Sutras and Ashtadhyayi Sutras are optimal, the design of the Paninian grammar appears to be nothing short of a miracle. Call it Panini's genius or Shiva's revelation, there are few things which compare to Panini's grammar as the crest-jewel of achievements of human (or divine) intelligence.
