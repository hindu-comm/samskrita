Dear Murthyji and Ramkrishnaji  
  
Thank you Murthyji for the more recent paper. Please click on the below link.  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Sutra>  
  
The link explains several points raised in this thread. at the end of the page there is another interesting paper titled The "Generative power of Feature Geometry " By Andras Kornai which gives another interesting mathematical perspective on Shiva Sutra  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
