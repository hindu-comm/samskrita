namaste, Shri Narayan! 

  

You have now got sufficient responses on how to efficiently do an electronic search.

  

To address the other part of your email:

"I am a novice in sanskrit but would like to understand what "taittiriya brahmaNam" contains. " - One possible approach, as already suggested, is to look up general texts on Vedic literature. A second approach is to ask 'paNDita's, about what this work contains. A third approach, like the English saying "..... teach a man to fish, and you feed him for life", is to learn more Sanskrit, and your search (electronic or manual) will become less cumbersome.

  

You must have a specific reason for wanting this particular information.
So, I wish you the best in finding what you are seeking.

  

But, in general, the story holds good, where somebody (a RShiputraH) wants to master the Vedas without studying, but by doing tapas. Indra, to illustrate his point, appears as a hermit trying to cast fistfuls of sand into the river (ganga, most likely) claiming to build a bridge.
This RShiputra tells Indra (in disguise) that his efforts are futile.
And in turn, Indra reveals his true identity and tells the RShiputra that there is no easy way to master Vedas. (Pardon the over simplification, lack of reference, and deviations, if any,from the original).

  

"I am prepared to put in hours and hours of search, day after day," - indicates you are not looking for an easy way out. All you now need is the smartest way to get to where you want to be.  

  

(search for) jinvataam, entered as a verb form, yields:

jinvatāmlemmatizes as:  
{ imp. \[1\] md. sg. 3 \| imp. \[1\] ac. du. 3 }\[[*jinv*](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/27.html#jinv)\]  

  

<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/27.html#jinv>  - yields (after translating from French to English)  

√जिन्व्*Jinv*\[connected to[*jiv*](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/27.html#jiiv)\] v.\[[1](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktconjug?q=jinv;c=1)\] pr.*(jinvati)*pp.*(jinvita)*induce, stimulate, activate, animate.

  

<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktconjug?t=VH&q=jinv&c=1&font=deva>
yields the various transformations of this verb, and the relevant form is located under  

  

लोट्

[TABLE]

loT lakAraH - prathamapuruShaH - ekavachanam - AtmanepadirUpam

  

-> in English, jinvatAm is probably translated as: (order or request) Let him activate / please activate ...

  

Based on the context the correct meaning may be understood.

  

I confess I had not come across this word before, so, I have learnt something new in the process. Thank you for that.

  

Regards,

  

Vidya
