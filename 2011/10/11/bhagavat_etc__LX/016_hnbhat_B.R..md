ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ७.१०४

  

इन्द्रासोमा परि वां भूतु विश्वत इयं मतिः कक्ष्याश्वेव वाजिना ।

यां वां होत्रां परिहिनोमि मेधयेमा ब्रह्माणि नृपतीवजिन्वतम्॥६॥

  

which is retaken in Artharvaveda Samhita  



In this context it is clearly second person dual. मध्यमपुरुषद्विवचन,

  

अग्निर्मूर्धा दिवः ककुत्पतिः पृथिव्या अयम् ।

अपां रेतांसि जिन्वति ॥१६॥

  

Many more verse forms would be found in Rgveda itself. Much more in Brahmana texts depending on your search. But the important thing is that traditionally Vedic texts are explained with निघण्टु as explained by यास्क in his निरुक्त a sort of running commentary on the Vedic vocabulary listed in the निघण्टु. For European readers, it is no more valid than Comparative Historical Linguists. The choice between the two streams of interpretation is left to the reader according to his requirement of understanding.

  

For Brahmana texts, are a sort of commentary on the Samhita portions providing legends to support their interpretations and many sacrificial rites in which selected "mantra" are to be utilized. This is just bare idea of the contents of the BrahmaNa texts. One will find many legends and episodes in them popularized by later Purana texts enlarging or adapting them to their scope.
