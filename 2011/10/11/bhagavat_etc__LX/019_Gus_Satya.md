Thanks for replies. And for vishvAs vAsuki, thanks for the link. The  
problem is that the result is different between your link (http://  
[sanskrit.inria.fr](http://sanskrit.inria.fr)) and taralabalu's ganakasthadyayi software when  
bhagavat being inputted.  
  
The result from ganakasthadyayi (which is based on astadhyayi)  
:  
  
bhagavad, bhagavat - nom sg masc  
bhagavad, bhagavat - voc sg masc  
bhagavatam - acuss sg masc  
  
declension results for other vibhaktis are the same.  
  
is there probably some issues in the software itself on applying the  
paninian rules?
