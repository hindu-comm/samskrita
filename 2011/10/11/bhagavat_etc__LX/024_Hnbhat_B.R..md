Thanks for the mantra-s. These are named as Pancabrahma mantra-s in this forum:

  

<http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/archive/index.php?t-5353.html>

  

and more details are available there. Also this link to yahoo groups also has some of the details:

These are said to be in Taittiriya Aranyaka (X.17-21):and Mahanarayanopanishat.

I have not checked the sources. The concept of Pancha brahman is explained in this link:

There is one upanishat called Pancha brahma also:

This link also give listed details about Pancabrahma as per the Upanishat format:

The Shadvarga is not any mantra. The MahavyahRuti-s are detailed in Taittiriya Upanishat.

  

Thanks for the reply.
