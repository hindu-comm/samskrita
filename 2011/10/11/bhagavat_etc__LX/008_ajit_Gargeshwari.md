Hi  
I guess there are no way one can google search and understand properly a taittiriya brahmaNam. However Translation of Krishna Yajur Veda exists example by Keith published in Harvard Oriental series in 2 two volumes. Normally vedic books are read with Bhashya of Sayanacharya.

  
  
I am a novice in sanskrit but would like to understand what "taittiriya brahmaNam" contains.  
  

I also feel ones knowledge of Sanskrit should be reasonably good to understand the Arnaykam and its commentary.  
If you want to know a summary of what it contains then a standard book on Vedic Literature may help.  
Other scholarly members of this group might be able to put what i said in the right perspective  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
