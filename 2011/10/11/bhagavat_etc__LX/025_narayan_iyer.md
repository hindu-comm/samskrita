Hello all,

  

While I thank Dr. Bhatt and Sri Satyajit, my question was rather broad-based.

  

For eg. in Sri VenkateSa suprabhaatham, one verse goes like this: "athryadhi saptha-rishaya samupAsya sandhyAm"... no list of Rsis is found thereafter. In sandhyA upasana, we have the list completed "athri, bhrugu, kutsa, vasishta, gautama, kAshyapa..."

  

Many who chant suprabhaatham, may not be performing sandhyA, and have no means of knowing the names of these seven Rsis. Further, this list of 7 Rsis does not include sage Vishwamitra, the giver of gayatri mantra or many others like sage yAjnyavalka etc. So I was wondering whether this aadhi-list is from an existing data base, and if so, where it is located.

  

Regards,

  

narayan
