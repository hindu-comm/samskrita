Dear Group,  
  
If I have understood the drift of this discussion correctly, it is  
this:  
  
"Whether one can adequately comprehend a serious work in a language  
with which one is not very familiar, by using dictionaries and more  
recent resources like internet searches for words?"  
  
I think the answer is in the negative. For a given word, the  
dictionaries and the internet will throw up several alternative  
suggestions. In order to be able to select out of them the most  
relevant will need some background knowledge, not only of the language  
but also of the cultural context in which those words occur. Machine  
translations cannot be accepted as they appear. This is an experience  
of anyone who has tried aids like [www.translate.google.com](http://www.translate.google.com)  
  
'The Spirit is ready but the flesh is not' and 'the Ghost is ready but  
the meat is not' could be valid machine/dictionary translations of the  
same thought. We choose one or the other depending on the context  
because we know beforehand the connotations of words like flesh, meat,  
spirit and ghost.
