Hello everyone,

  

First, my thanks to everyone who responded to my query Re: search for sanskrit words/phrases/sentences through google and sanskrit dictionaries. My earlier mail expressing thanks did not appear, hence thanks once again.

  

Many of the slokas/mantras just give the first word of the list and add "aadhi" to make the list complete, like:

  

1. Bhuraadhi sapta vyahruteenam (gayatri avahanam mantra)

2. kaama, krodha-adhi shad-varga.... (Sri Lalitha Ashtottaram)

3. Sadyojaatha-adhi - pancha-brahma mantras etc.

  

One who knows or is conversant with the mantras may know the remaining items of the adhi-list. But what about those, who are coming across these terms for the first time? Is there any text or scripture where these items are listed? If so, where?

  

Regards,

  

narayan.
