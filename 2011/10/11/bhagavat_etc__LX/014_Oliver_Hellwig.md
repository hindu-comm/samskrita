Narayan,  
  
as Eddie wrote, there is no easy solution for your task.  
  
The Digital Corpus of Sanskrit may make it, however, a bit easier;  
find it at  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php>  
  
Although Taittiriyasamhita is not contained, you can easily trace the  
words you need and their meanings, and also find collocations, phrases  
and citations, if you are interested in this kind of information.  
  
If you need Devanagari output, go to  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_center>  
and activate "Devanagari output".  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Best, Oliver

\> Hello everyone,  
\>  
\> I would like to know the most efficient means for searching the sanskrit words or phrases or sentences through google and sanskrit dictionaries.  
\>  
\> I am a novice in sanskrit but would like to understand what "taittiriya brahmaNam" contains. There are no translations of taittiriya brahmaNam available, either in english or in vernacular languages (Hindi or Marathi or Tamil - languages known to me) If such translation exists, please let me know. I would be highly grateful.  
\>  
\> The only alternative available to me is to look for "word for word" translations in sanskrit dictionary or to google search by keying in the mantras (in roman script), if it does not return any hit, go by phrases or if still unlucky, try by words etc. Since I do not know many root "dhatus", I gasp for find the correct equivalent in english for words like "jinvathaam" etc. which appear in the very first mantra.  
\>  
\> I am prepared to put in hours and hours of search, day after day, but I would like to the most efficient method of locating the words or phrases either through the search engines or through sanskrit-english dictionary.
