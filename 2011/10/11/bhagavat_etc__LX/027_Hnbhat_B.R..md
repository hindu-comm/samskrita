Better you can re-phrase your question with some precise point and not wild with guesses. What do you want to know? The meaning of the Suprabhata line or the list of sages you recite during Sandhya or the geneaolgy of Vishvamitra or who are the seven Rishi-s mentioned in the Suprabhatam?

  

You can always find the names of the seven Rishi-s called in Sapta-Rishi-s in any standard dictionary as Murthy has suggested already.
