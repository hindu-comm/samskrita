Narayan,



 There is no easy way. It remains a largely manual process.



However, there is software that assists that very process.



Here is the online software, and the page to start you off:



[
http://sanskrit.inria.fr/faq.html](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/faq.html "http://sanskrit.inria.fr/faq.html")



Then once you have the uninflected base form of the word, or words, as there are often many candidates, you can then look them up such as the Monier Williams dictionaries, online or offline.



There, the words are arranged in order within their particular root.



Then you’re on your own!





Happy hunting,



 Eddie
