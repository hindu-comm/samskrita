Namaste,



Once I attended a lecture by Swami Vidyadhisananda Giri and he gave a talk on the significance of cow. I typing it here from myrecollection.



The significance of cow is linked to the definition of Bharateeyata, the fact that bhArateeyata is about being a Yagna Bhoomi. Our culture and tradition is around that.



The scriptures says that there is an elaborate science behind it Yagnam.



Sun rays and cosmic rays have three gunas - satwa (knowledge), Rajas (Activity) and Tamas (Inertia, or Storing) When these rays hit earth, the Tamas is absorbed by the body of water in the oceans which are then converted into rain.



All beings on land mass absorb the Rajo gunam from the sun rays - that's why the activity starts with Sun rise. However, Satwa gunam is not absorbed by any - except Cow. There are certain species of cows that have the ability to absorb the Satwa gunam in the Sun rays. They have mostly become extinct but presently about 8 species becoming extant now in India. By and large most of the cows through out the world give milk that has A1 protein. However, these special cows have the ability to absorb the Satwa principle in the Sun rays and convert them into A2 protein in their milk which in addition to holding knowledge principle, is very rich in Oxygen content. Only another living being has this ability albeit in limited duration. Pregnant mother has the ability to absorb the Satwa guna from Sun rays and convert into A2 protein in her breast milk.



When Ghee is made from this Cow's A2 rich milk it is now concentrated in Oxygen content.

Yagnam is a scientific process to convert this concentrated oxygen in Ghee into large portions for purifying the environment. When a fire is made by rubbing Aswatha Tree branch and Ravi tree branch and light a geometrical pit and then pouring this Ghee in small quantities while vibrating the place with certain Vedic Mantras will make the Oxygen content in Ghee into 1000s folds in the form of the Smoke generated, which will make the people who get exposed to this smoke and also the atmosphere get purified.



Since Yagnams were so essential in bhArateya culture, we tend to make all the elements that go into Yagnam as sacred including Cows.

  
Thanks
