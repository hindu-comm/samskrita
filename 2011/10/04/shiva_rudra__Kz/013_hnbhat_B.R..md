Practice is a different think customized by the demand of the time as and when need arise. Scriptural study and their commentaries is another thing. Thinking only one is right and the other is wrong, is the common flaw among the practitioners.

  

There are many शाखा-s and सूत्र-s for each शाखा-s and प्रयोग-s utilizing the same मन्त्र-s in ऋग्वेद. The कल्पसूत्र-s are considered to be the वेदाङ्ग-s than our own conviction on our practice today. And महान्यास is following the प्रयोग of बोधायनसूत्र, and न्यास is part of the प्रयोग for रुद्राध्याय if I am right in worshiping रुद्र including एकादश rudra.

  

Identifying रुद्र with शिव is a matter of faith, than scriptural authority to be exercised. "सर्वं ब्रह्ममयम्" statement doesn't need any discussion, as it identifies anything with ब्रह्म (and not with ब्रह्मा one of the trinity of Gods, of पुराण-s).

  

I am also not sure of the whole exercise to deviate from the point in discussion, tying to make it one between believers and non-believers (than practitioners and non-practitioners). I am afraid whether it is in any way helpful to keep the spirit of the group neutral.
