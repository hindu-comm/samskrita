\[starting a new thread\]  
  
Dear shrI Bhatji,  
  
My personal belief, more as a devotee, is that of an *ekam sat, vipra bahudha vadanti*. I consider Shiva, Rudra or for that matter others being different forms of the same God. \[I don't have a proof for this :-) \]. So I treat rudradhyaya as praise for the same God. I do respect your view as shiva as being a praise of rudra, from a linguistic perspective. I will also try and findout from some of the commentaries I have...  
  
But i would like to ask you from a non-devotee perspective, if you see any distinct reason for rudra to be different from shiva. For example, rudra is constantly addressed as shiva in rudradhyaya ..  
  
शिवा रुद्रस्य भॆषजी, शिवा रुद्राः भॆषजी  
  
नमस्तॆ अस्तु भगवन् विश्वॆश्वराय......त्र्यंबकाय....सदाशिवाय...श्रीमन् महादॆवाय..  
  
\[I believe the second is not found in all commentaries, esp, sayana, but is there in abhinava-shankara bhashya.\]

By the quotation itself has superlative degree of the adjectives शिव and शिवतर are used as adjectives for शम्भु or रुद्र the main deity of the रुद्राध्याय and doesn't in any way indicate शिव is the deity praised in this portion as it is also among one of the adjectives used in praise of रुद्र. Any comments are welcome and free at the desire and inclination of the devotees.
