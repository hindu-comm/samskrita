Thank you for the clarification.  
  
To do a Shastric study of the verses which is abetter bhashya? The one by Sayanacharya or Bhattabhaskara or Vishnu Suri.  
The reason for why I am asking this question is I wanted to understand the text in terms of its philosophy and its impact on Shavaite schools of vedanta.  
  
I read somewhere i do not remember where Srirudram accurs in the Karma Kanda and is used to perform homa. So are the mantras of pure devotional value or does it contain profound philosophy. ( I am not saying devotion is not a philosophy its much higher)  
  
Is there any connection between Rudra Bhashya and Shivarahsya if there is Shivarahsya completely available as printed text  
Thank you once again  
  
Regards
