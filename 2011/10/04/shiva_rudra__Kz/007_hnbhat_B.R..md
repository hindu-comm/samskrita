In my limited knowledge, there is no direct relation between the शैव schools (both आगम and सिद्धान्त schools) which had their own आगम texts and during later interchange with the different schools of philosophical innovations progressing, some exchange of their sources could not be ruled out.

  

A thoughacquaintanceship with both the fields of literature is required to have a comparative study if one wants to explore this aspect you suggested. There too South Indian Shaivism seems based on Tamil Sources than Sanskrit Vedic Literature in ancient time though might have been adopted to comply with with the demands in later times to cope up with others.

  

This is just an idea.
