namaste,

  

\> the samhita itself doesn't say that the intended usage of these prasnas

  

The kAThaka-brAhmaNa says "agnAviShNU iti vasrodhArAyAH".

  

  

\> There is also one method stipulated by Ravana. I am not sure if somebody follows it.  

  

The rAvaNokta mahAnyAsa is almost the same as the bodhAyanokta mahAnyAsa. The difference is just some additional mantras and shlokas. Many people follow the rAvaNokta method (thought they may not realize it). It is quite common.

  

sasneham,

  

 ajit
