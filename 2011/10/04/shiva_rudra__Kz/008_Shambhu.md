The threads ‘satyam-shivam-sundaram’, ‘rudra’, and ‘shiva and rudra’  
have wandered all over. The opinions of the Western scholars (‘rudra  
is a minor deity’, etc.) would be quite silly in the eyes of the  
Vaidika practitioners, who still exist in large numbers, possibly in  
this group as well; they have their own distinct theories and  
practices about rudra. Of course, classifying a deity as minor or  
major based on the number of hymns or words in the Veda-s is also an  
opinion. It means nothing to the Vadika practitioners.  
  
Although often the devatA of a mantra and the very mantra are  
connected (‘sadAshiva rudro devatA’ for ‘aum namaH shivAya’ mantra),  
we easily locate many mantra-s with no such self-evident connection.  
Example: Rigveda 10-125, the ambhraNI sUktam whose devatA is given as  
AtmA and it is used in the RigvedIya traditions as an abhiSeka sUktam  
for devi (umA). Apparently herein, the devI is declaring about  
Herself.  
  
Leaving aside the confusions contributed by the purANa-s and the Agama-  
s, rudra has a major place in the Vaidika traditions, even among  
today’s Vaidika-s, not just among the ancient ‘Vedic people’. This  
rudra is not shiva, whoever ‘shiva’ is. This rudra is not the creation  
of the deva-devatA-s either. This rudra was around before all the  
other deva-devatAs were born. Only svayambhu brahma existed before  
him. In fact, shruti declaration is there stating that rudra saw  
hiraNyagarbha taking birth (taittirIyAraNyaka – mahAnArAyaNopanishad).  
The ten prajApati-s, brahmaNaspati, br\`haspati, indra, soma, viSNu,  
bhaga, aryama, sUrya, mitra-varuNa, uSas, pUSaN, ashvins, etc. were  
created only later in the subsequent creation of the universe by  
pitAmaha brahma (svayambhu) as per the shruti formula he heard from  
nArAyaNa.  
  
There are plenty of similarities between Veda-s’ indra and purANa-s’  
shiva, more than between rudra and shiva. If rudra is fierce, indra is  
no less. If rudra is ‘aghora’ and ‘abhayankara’, indra is charming and  
pleasing too. Indra is purandara, shiva is tripurAntaka, indrANI is  
the wife par excellence, and so is sati or gaurI, etc. rudrANI is  
hardly invoked. If we view shiva of the purANa-s as Veda-s’ indra  
pervading our galaxy cluster and viSNu as soma pervading our galaxy,  
the relevant rik mantra-s reveal the story of the cosmological  
evolution. In this view, rudra pervades the entire universe. Without  
rudra, no other deva-devatAs would exist.  
  
Even in the daily sandhyA vandanA, we begin offering our namaskAra-s  
to various deva-devatAs, and therein we say “rudrAya namaH, shivAya  
namaH’. If rudra and shiva were identical, why is this repetition?  
Further in the daily panchAyatana pUjA, based on the vinoyoga mantra-s  
we can say that here the shiva is actually rudra. There is really no  
shiva as a deity even in today’s Vaidika practices. Such a popular  
notion only exists, even among the practicing Vaidika-s and archaka-s,  
thanks to the over-powering propagation of the purANa-s and the Agama-  
s.  
  
For example, we may examine the five RigvedIya abhiSeka sUkta-s for  
sUrya, gaNapati, ambikA, shiva, and viSNu. All these mantra-s are from  
the various maNdala-s of the Rigveda, and they are in wide practice  
even today - we are not discussing some by-gone pre-history. By and  
large, sUrya is the devatA in the 64 mantra-s of the saura sUktam.  
gaNesha sUktam mantra-s have brahmaNaspati (one mantra) and indra (11  
mantra-s) as the devatA-s. devI sUktam (with 8 mantra-s) has AtmA as  
devatA. viSnu sUktam with 45 mantra-s has viSNu as devatA. In  
contract, for ‘deity shiva’, we have 42 rik mantra-s with rudra as the  
devatA.  
  
The yajurvedIya practice is also likewise – the rudra prashna,  
mentioned in the thread, used in worshiping ‘shiva’ is actually full  
of prayers to rudra and the eleven rudra-s. In fact, in the nyAsa  
(prior to any rudra prashna related viniyoga) while describing rudra  
deva, we say “parshvayoH shivA-shankarau tiSTetAm”. One never says  
“shiva homa”; it is ‘rudra homa’ only. Therefore shiva pUjA is indeed  
rudra pUjA.  
  
Saying ‘rudra is a minor Vedic deity’, based on whatever  
‘classification’, reflects ignorance of the Vaidika practice where  
rudra indeed is worshiped in the daily panchAyatana pUjA among other  
deities (sUrya, gaNapti, ambikA, and viSNu). It is like the kitchen  
plumber dispensing opinions about brain surgery. By and large, this is  
the weakness in the non-practitioners’ works on the Veda-s.
