Hi Ajit,  
  
Thanks for clarification. Yes, I am aware that Samhita itself has references to other mantras for usage. For example much of Yajurveda is said to be how we carryout the Yajna's. There is a 'only' towards the end of my question. I was half-sleepy when I wrote it. I could have been more clear.  
  
I was trying to ask, if it is limited to such homa. I guess it is not. The reason I am asking is that I got an impression from the previous discussion, that rudradhyaya is not originally 'intened' to be used the way it is today. Hence i was trying to ask if that is the case.  
  
I am not familiar with many of the texts so I thought this group can help me in understanding correctly.  
  
Thanks for teh clarification on the ravanokta mahanyasa,  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
