I've shrI-shivarahasyam (aMshas 4,5 and 6) printed from TMSSM Library, Thanjavur. This is third of the series. So, at least 3 volumes were published.  
I don't know about other volumes.  

Search on DLI presented shivarahasyam in kannada. I didn't bother myself to download as I don't know that language or script.
