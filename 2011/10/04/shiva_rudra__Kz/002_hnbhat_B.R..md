I didn't mention that शिव and रुद्र are different or same. I just mentioned that शिव is not the देवता, of रुद्राध्याय as devotees, practice, according to the practice, it is

अस्य रुद्रस्य प्रश्नस्य अघोरऋषिः, अनुष्टुप्छन्दः, श्रीसदाशिवरुद्रो देवता this is the image that devotees call by शिव. and you need not look around for their identity as भट्टभास्कर has quoted a verse to the effect that रुद्र is known as शिव--

  

अशुभद्रावको रुद्रो यज्जहार पुनर्भवम्।

तस्माच्छिवस्तततो रुद्रशब्देनाभिधीयते॥

  

He offers more etymologies for the same रुद्र interpreted differently by many and remarked एवं तीर्थकारैः स्वस्वमयानुगतं रुद्रपदं व्युत्पाद्यते = thus आचार्य-s derive the word रुद्र according to their stand point of view (सिद्धान्त). If you want I can myself produce all the etymologies of पौराणिक-s as given by him. But I refrain from doing so for fear of the post being too lengthy. For the identification, as mentioned by भट्टाभास्कर, P Ramakrishnan has already quoted a verse from शिवपुराण in another post. There are many which can be quoted as for their identity or with the परब्रह्म as I have already remarked in the other post according to the different schools claiming one of the names as the superior one.

  

"एको रुद्रो ऽवतस्थे न द्वितीयः" resonance the popular महावाक्य - "एकमेवाद्वितीयं ब्रह्म"

  

I don't give the reference for saving time and as it is too popular.

  

As for the deities in Vedic Texts, there are देवतानुक्रमणी of शौनक, and देवताकाण्ड in the निघण्टु commented by यास्क in his निरुक्त which is also considered to be as वेदाङ्ग which is the authority. For each Chapter, they have fixed a deity according to the topic and for each Mantra or group of Mantra-s, they have been accredited with ऋषि, देवता and छन्दस् for practical purposes. So according to the देवताकाण्ड I had posted my reply in the other thread with derivations accordingly. For example, even though रुद्राध्याय has been popular as dedicated to रुद्र as the deity of the अध्याय, each mantra, has got its own fixed ऋषि, छन्दस् and देवता, individually for practical purpose and for their utility for different purposes. All these are specified in the commentary of भट्टभास्कर. As for the तात्पर्य of the अध्याय, a standard had been adopted:

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारौ अभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम् ।

*अर्थवादोपपत्ती च*लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये ॥

  

Especially in the Vedic Literature, conclusions are drawn by our ancestors following above standard and not of their own.

  

Sorry for the lengthy reply.
