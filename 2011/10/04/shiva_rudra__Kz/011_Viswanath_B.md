Dear Shri Sivaramakrishna Sharma Mahodaya,  
  
Thanks for the explanation, I have a small question on your mention of 'originally intended for" in your email.  
  
From what I understand, The shrauta sutra, and/or the grihya sutra provide us the method for carrying out the yagna or the homa etc.  
  
So, when you say "they are originally intended for .... ", I am assuming that you are saying - "earliest references to the usage of namakam and chamakam" are known to be the isthi homa or the vasordhara homa. In otherwords I am trying to say that the samhita itself doesn't say that the intended usage of these prasnas is for these homa only.  
  
I hope I understood you correctly. Please let me know,  
  
The reason why i am asking this question is thus - If the samhita itself doesn't limit the possibility of the usage, and the usage itself is governed by the kalpa sutras, then there is a possibility that the kalpa sutras does stipulate usage of these prasnas in other procedures as well. May be just that we are not aware.  
  
Mahanyasa method that is followed today is the one stipulated by Bodhayana. There is also one method stipulated by Ravana. I am not sure if somebody follows it.  
  
Thanks  
Viswanath
