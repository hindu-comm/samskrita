namaste,



Dear Dr. Bhat, though I am replying to your mail, this response is not directed solely at you. I am writing it after reading the various threads \[\[ Incidentally, having a single thread would have been helpful. Though you asked for multiple threads, and that is what resulted, it actually made it \*harder\* to follow the conversation ! \]\]





\> Practice is a different think customized by the demand of the time as and when need arise.

\> Scriptural study and their commentaries is another thing.





The words of certain ancient practitioners, like Bodhyana, are authoritative. It is not without reason that he is given the epiteth "bhagavAn bodhAyana". In the laghunyAsa, it is "shiva" whoheseats in the heart. (Before someone brings it up again, I know that rudra and shankara are seated elsewhere. I don't want to address this tangent now).



There is a commentary on the rudra-prashna by skanda-svAmin, where he gives a different dhyAna-shloka for each mantra in the rudra prashna. As an example, inthe second mantra, he invokes "shambhum umayA sArdham". This is clearly shiva.



According to the tradition of the bodhAyanas (followed by others as well), after giving the vidhi "athAtmAnam shrii-rudra-rUpam dhyAyet", certain dhyAna-shlokas are chanted. Rudra is invoked astrinetram, ga\~ngAdharam, shUla-pANinam, umA-dehArdha-dhAriNam etc. It is clearly shiva.



Without a shadow of a doubt, in practice, there is a clear identification of shiva as the presiding devatA of the rudra-prashna. If, on the basis ofa fewtexts ("authoritative" or otherwise), it is said to be the non-shiva rudra alone, I would ask -- Is this the pancha mukha rudra, aShTa mUrtirudra, shata rudra, mRtyu\~njaya rudra or some other rudra?



I hopethe readersget the point. If "rudra" were a well-understood single entity, we could attempt to see if rudra were different from shiva. Since he is not, such an exercise is pointless. Any attempt to answer this question would be mere speculation. Some of it may be scholarly speculation, but it is speculation none the less !





\>Thinking only one is right and the other is wrong





Both the words of bhaktas and the words of commentators are only the beginning. The actual devatA has to be borne out of sAdhanA and experience. Unfortunately, those who have experienced vedic mantras largely stay out of the limelight. The problem with commentators is that they had an ocean of veda to study and comment upon ... in the journey to cover the entire breadth of a topic, depth is naturally foresaken.



Anyways, I only read this group in spurts. My apologizes if I don't participate in this thread in a timely manner.



sasneham,



 ajit
