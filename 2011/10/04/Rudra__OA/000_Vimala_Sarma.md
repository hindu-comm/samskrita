Looking back on the posts, I get the sense that people have thought that I have made a arbitrary deprecatory judgement on Rudra because I said he was a minor god of Rgveda, and have reacted to this. I would like to explain this a little further. It is not my personal judgement but scholars, such as Macdonell, have classified the significance of the gods to the vedic peoples according to the number of hymns addressed to the particular deity. By this classification it can be seen that the major deities are Indra (with a quarter of all hymns addressed to him), Agni (about 200), Varuna-Mitra (as dual deities), Dyava-Prithivi (dual deities, mentioned 100 times), Soma (entire 9^(th) book). In contrast, Rudra has 3 hymns addressed to him, one jointly with Soma.



With regard to ethymology, root rud (to cry) + tR suffix (making agent noun); therefore - crier or howler. It also makes some sense in his being associated with winds and storms (howling wind, etc).
