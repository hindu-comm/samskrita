Dear LalithAlAlitha

I am not quoting, I am clarifying how the conclusion was reached.
Certainly you count the number of hymns to any deity for yourself.

I do not have any more to add except on this post except to say, from a historical perspective, what may have happened in later texts such as identifying Shiva with Rudra should not be projected backwards on to earlier texts. This is what is known as a hermeneutical error.
