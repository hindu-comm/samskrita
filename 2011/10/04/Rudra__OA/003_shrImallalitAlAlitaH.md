Are you again supporting you view by quoting someone else ?  
I don't think that the word minor was appropriate. You may have used some other word.  
You must remember that not all people here depend on Mcdonell, etc. to know about rudra, etc. Many of us have direct reach to veda-s and their commentaries.
