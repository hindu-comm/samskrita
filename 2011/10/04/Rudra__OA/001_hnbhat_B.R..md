Thanks Madam Vimalaji for starting a new thread for Rudra. This is expected from other members too.

  

As you have mentioned रुद्र is a minor deity in Rigveda is right. But I am not sure whether it means the violent counter part of our शिव or सदाशिव is intended in the hymns dedicated to him. Etymologies can be offered in different ways. Nirukta is the authority on the etymologies of Vedic words and need not rely upon Paninan description of words in classical Sanskrit. Here is the relevant portion of the Nirukta:

  

रुद्रो रौति इति सतो रोरूयमानो द्रवति इति वा, रोदयतेर्वा/

१०,५ यद् अरुदत्तद् रुद्रस्य रुद्रत्वम् इति काटकम्/

१०,५ \`\`यद् अरोदीत् तद्रुद्रस्य.रुद्रत्वम् इति हारिद्रविकम्/

१०,५: तस्य एषा.भवति/

  

and the praises are given in common to वरुण and मरुत्. as in the case of विष्णु and not necessarily they praise शिव in his fierce form. In contrast, as per the above quotations for derivation from काठकसंहिता,
ब्राह्मण -

  

"इन्द्रः किल पितरं प्रजापतिमिषुणा चिच्छेद, तमनुशोचन् अरुदत् यत् तद् रुद्रस्य रुद्रत्वम्।"(बृहदारण्यक ३.९.४) refers to इन्द्र known by the name रुद्र. The other quotation also seems to support this episode.

  

According to ऐतरेयब्राह्मण also the same episode is reinstated, with the difference that प्रजापति chasing his own daughter, was cut off his head by रुद्र, who was created by Gods accumulating their aggressive powers to create him and he was asked by them to punish प्रजापति for his licentiousness and immoral conduct.

  

The grammatical etymology respectively following the above definitions for रुद्र are as follows:

  

रु शब्दे + क्विप् - रुत्

रौति इति रुत्

रा दाने + क - र

रुद्+र - रुद्रः।

रौति - produces sound of thunders and राति - gives rain water. रुद्रः makes it इन्द्र the deity of celestial abode according to three fold classification of the Vedic deities.

  

रोरूयमाणः - रुद्रः - derived from the same root, रु + यङ्

  

रोरूयते अतिशयेन रौति - इति रोरूयमाणः, द्रवतीति द्रः - द्रु+ड- द्रः। meaning the same producing sound of thunders in the clouds, and pours water.

  

रोरयति - शतूणां स्त्रीः शत्रुनाशनेन इति रुद्रः -

प्रेरणार्थे णिच् । One who causes the women of the enemies cry with causative form of the verb रु. as per

"रोदेर्णिलुक् च"(उणादि २.२२) रोदि+र- रुद्+र \> रुद्रः।

  

Now the form supported by the quoted ब्राह्मण, also the same as above, without the causative meaning. Who cries himself, in atonement of killing his own father प्रजापति as given in the ब्राह्मण.

  

All the definitions makes this रुद्र looks him different from the violent counterpart of the one popular in पुराण-s. But rest is left to the believers and followers of the respective cults to draw on the same hymns to support their belief which need not any etymology or निरुक्त. Many of the deities found differently quoted in मन्त्रशस्त्र which has sources in the respective cults and draw on Vedic mantra-s according to their needs.

  

The whole of रुद्राध्याय has been interpreted by the अभिनवभारती जगद्गुरु of शृङ्गेरी, in terms of Advaita philosophy. The commentary is published and made available in this group some time ago. I don't have the details.
