Brahma has come from the root brih to swell, grow, enlarge.

Brihmate iti brahma.



This therefore can apply to the universe which has come from

the big bang. The recent nobel prize winners have opined that

the universe is still expanding faster and faster.



According to Hindu mythology there will also be a dissolution

called laya. Probably it will take many many years for modern

scientists to find that there would be a contraction.
