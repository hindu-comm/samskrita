Dear Mr. Bhat ,  
  
Thank you for your help .  
  
My thought process is like this . How come Kubera is invoked in vaidic mantras ( Yajurveda) while the personal gods became popular much later in pauranik period . I think with the leads you have given I am progressing in the correct direction .  
  
Regards ,
