The above is the etymology and definition of Kub(v)era in as depicted in पुराण-s. For the meaning in Veda-s you may have to refer to some commentary on the portion. Otherwise, it may not mean anything from the पुराण based etymology or the legends therein. The above fits the disfigured Kubera in icons in temples dedicated in different places.

  

And, the above "mantra" is used in "mantrashastra" a different field than Veda-s, to invoke RavaNa for a rite called रावणबलि as they call it. I don't have any more information on it. Just like both are दाशरथि-s as the sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana are known popularly by their names, than दाशरथि which is a common name except it is clear by the context. So there is nothing strange if both RavaNa and Kubera are called वैश्रवण-s and to make it clear it is Kuvera, both the names are used in the verse.

  

Usually both are different in form by derivation from the same word विश्रवस् - the sons of are called वैश्रवण and रावण according to some source. This all from the point of view of etymology. For meaning, there may or may not be more of such legends in Brahmana-s if you look for such words found in any in Vedic Literature. I don't think the verse is of Vedic origin. But for confirmation, some Vedic Concordance can be consulted.

  

I can't see why two sons of a father could not be named differently for all practical purposes.
