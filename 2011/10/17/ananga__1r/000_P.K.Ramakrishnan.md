There is a well known verse where the word ananga is used.  

  

I remember it is given in Bhojaprabandham.

  

When Bhoja was holding a poets' assembly, it was getting dark.

Bhoja asked the poets to describe the sunset.

  

Then

  

The first poet said -   परिपतति पयोनिधौ पतंग:

  

The second poet said - सरसिरुजामुदरेषु मत्तभृंग:

  

The third poet said -  उपवनतरुकॊटरे विहंग:

  

Kalidasa said -        युवतिजनॆषु शनैश्शनैरनंग:

  

I hope the meaning is clear. The first three lines are just statements. There is no poetry in them.But the last line has poetry. It is said that Bhoja congratulated Kalidasa on this.
