Namo namaha.  
A similar story is told about Baanbhatta, the author of 'Kadambari' a  
rare exercise of writing a prose piece of high literary value in  
Sanskrit.  
Banabhatta was on the death bed and wanted to judge who of his two  
sons,would be able to complete the story. So he called both of his  
sons and asked the elder son to describe the felled tree in the  
courtyard of the house.He said,"shushkam kashtham tishthatyagre"\[A dry  
log of wood lies in front \[ of the house\].The desperate father then  
asked young Bhooshanabhatta, who replied, "Neerasa tarurih wilasti  
purataha".Banabhatta died peacefully, by handing over the  
responsibility of the completing his literary work to Bhooshanabhatta.  
While reading Kadambari, we do not feel any discontinuity from where  
the father dropped and the son picked up.  
Apologies for the inability to type Devanagaree script.  
Kshamaprarthee,Narendra Sakhalkar
