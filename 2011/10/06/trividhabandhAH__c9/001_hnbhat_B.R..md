I t certainly exists in Sankhya philosophy.

  

Here is the extract from the V text of Sankhyakarika-

  

स च*बन्धस्त्रिविधः*। प्रकृतिबन्धो वैकारिकबन्धो दक्षिणाबन्धश्चेति । तत्र प्रकृतिबन्धो नामाष्टासु प्रकृतिषु परत्वेनाभिमानः । वैकारिकबन्धो नाम ब्रह्मादिस्थानेषु श्रेयोबुद्धिः । दक्षिणाबन्धो नाम गवादिदानेज्यानिमित्तः ।

  

In the text, it could be emended asदक्षिणासा (?स्व)रूपश्चेति

  

The commentary makes it clear. In all the बन्ध makes it mean the attachment. सांख्य philosophy is considered as नास्तिक दर्शन too. It considers the priority given to प्रकृति as also the बन्ध and the ब्रह्म etc. are considered among बन्ध-s. The last बन्ध seems to make it clearer दक्षिणा in the form giving of cow, etc. sacrifice etc. It is योग philosophy that postulates a ईश्वर as one of the means to concentrate and contemplate upon to realize the पुरुष different from प्रकृति. The realization of पुरुष as distinct from the प्रकृति is considered as the highest goal , the liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Considering प्रकृति as the highest goal, also leads to a stage of liberation प्रकृतिलय but it is also cause of rebirth such as ब्रह्मा etc. the lower level of liberation. This is the basis of the gradation of the बन्ध according to सांख्य philosophy.
