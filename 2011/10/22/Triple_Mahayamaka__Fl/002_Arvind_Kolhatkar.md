Chitrakavya, such as the above, certainly is a tour the force of its  
creator and exhibits his mastery over the language but the question to  
be asked is 'does it legitimately belong to the field of poetry'?  
  
Does the increasing prevalence of Chitrakavya in the later  
mahaakaavyas indicate a growing elitization of poetry and of the  
Sanskrit language itself, and the widening gap between Sanskrit-  
knowing elites from the common man? Kalidasa, whose mastery over the  
language and felicity of expression are unquestioned, employs  
Chitrakavya but once and that too, very sparingly - only in sarga 9 of  
Raghuvansha -, as if to say, 'I , too, can write Chitrakavya if I want  
to but I will not do so because I am interested in writing poetry and  
not in exhibiting my superior mastery over the language!'  
  
Vishwanatha does not notice Chitrakavya at all. I have not studied  
Dhvanyaaloka but remember to have read that Abhinavagupta called it  
'akaavya'.
