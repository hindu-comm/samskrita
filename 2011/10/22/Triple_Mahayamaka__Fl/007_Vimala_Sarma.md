Thank you for the commentary – I have to confess that it would be impossible to get all those meanings from the one pada – and I and wondering what the others think. Are such translations valid or could one say it is being embellished somewhat by the commentator reading much more in to it than is justified by the text? I think this is the sort of thing western scholars would find some difficulties with. Also saying the same pada over and over again may not as aesthetic to them, as it may be to the author.
