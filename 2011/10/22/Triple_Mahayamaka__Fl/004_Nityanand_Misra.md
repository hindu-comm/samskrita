You are right cent percent, Citrakaavya is surely akaavya.



1.When it is devoid of any bhaava and only full of kalaa, like in the case of the trayii works like Kiraataarjuniiyam (Bharavi) and Sisupaalavadham (Magha), it is verily a-kaavya(न काव्यम्इति अकाव्यम्or non-poetry). 

2.When it is with bhaava, like in the case of Bhakti works like Padukasahasram (Vedanta Desika), Stavamala (Rupa Gosvamin) or the work below, it is again a-kaavya (अकारो वासुदेवः तस्मै तस्य तुष्टये वा काव्यम् इति अकाव्यम्or poetry for the Lord). Bhakti is by definition,परमप्रेमरूपाandअमृतस्वरूपा, a Bhakti work by implication is then भावप्रधान(primarily passion or emotion).

On a more serious note, it is the presence or absence of bhaava that matters, not the complexity of figure of speeches. Where the vyangaartha is absent and only figures of speech are present, that has been called Adhamakaavya. You would be surprised to know that some consider all Laghutrayi and Brihattrayi works – including those of Kalidasa - to fall in this category. Here is one such opinion, from the linguist George Grierson, who also talks about “heart and soul” or in other words “bhaava” in the quote below –



*Kalidasa may begin his Raghuvamsa with a comparison of himself to a dwarf, and of his powers over language to a skiff on the boundless ocean; but from under those modest words there gleams a consciousness of his own superiority. His modesty is evidently mock, and the poet is really saying from himself, all the while; “I shall soon show my readers how learned I am and what a command I have over the nine poetic flavours.” But (and this is another reason for his superiority) Tulasi never wrote a line in which he did not himself believe his heart and soul. … Kalidasa took the tale of Rama as a peg on which to hang his garland of graceful verses, but Tulasi Dasa wove wreaths of imperishable fragrance and humbly laid them at the feet of the God whom he adored.*
