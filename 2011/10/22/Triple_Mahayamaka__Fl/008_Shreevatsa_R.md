Do you mean that the pada does not actually mean all those things (so there is some sort of deception going on), or

do you mean that it is impossible/difficult for a reader to "decode" these meanings without the help of a commentary?

  

I agree with the latter.

The commentator is the author here, so that question does not arise. And generally in history, with such intricate chitrakavya, often the author has written a commentary himself/herself, because it is hard for readers to infer the meaning the author intended, without help.

Even in the Indian tradition, these are not considered great poetry. It is verbal gymnastics, but it is impressive and has its own place. The works of Oulipo, say, (or my personal favourite, the works by Mike Keith e.g. <http://cadaeic.net/notawake.htm> ) are not often aesthetic either, but they are interesting nevertheless -- and the even the primitive Sanskrit examples are much more amazing!

And it is fun for the author: we see that even authors like Anandavardhana who condemned chitrakavya nevertheless have composed their own examples. :-)
