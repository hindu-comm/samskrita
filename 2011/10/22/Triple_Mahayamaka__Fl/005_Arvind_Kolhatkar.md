(This somewhat straying away from the main line of this thread...)

\<Kalidasa may begin his Raghuvamsa with a comparison of himself to a  
dwarf, and of his powers over language to a skiff on the boundless  
ocean; but from under those modest words there gleams a consciousness  
of his own superiority. His modesty is evidently mock, and the poet is  
really saying from himself, all the while; “I shall soon show my  
readers how learned I am and what a command I have over the nine  
poetic flavours.”>

Neither we nor nor Grierson can put this Kalidasa himself to hear his  
side. Grierson's saying could thus fall into the प्रिये कैतवम्  
category. Didn't Kalidasa also say:

आ परितोषाद् विदुषां न साधु मन्ये प्रयोगविज्ञानम्।  
बलवदपि शिक्षितानामात्मन्यप्रत्ययं चेतः॥
