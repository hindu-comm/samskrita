Hence 'ananga', though can refer to many things, refers to > madana ('cupid'), justified by the commentators of yore, and accepted > universally within Sanskrit Literature context as such. Of-course, a > new commentator (quoted earlier in the thread) has chosen in his / her > opinion to consider this epithet as inappropriate - that, I believe, > is that new commentator's personal belief.

(योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी > is discussed in Tarkasangraha-dIpikA by annambhaTTa, in the context of > 'shabda pramANa', or, 'Valid Verbal Testimony')   - This is strong > reasoning for acceptance of the term under question, rather than a > weak "learn live with it", as I have understood from certain posts. >
