I do not think that शास्त्रात् रूढिर्बलीयसी is the reason we continue  
to use अनङ्ग for Cupid and not some other, more शास्त्रपूत word.

शास्त्रात् रूढिर्बलीयसी suggests that we all know and agree what the  
शास्त्र says but still have to obey the dictates of रूढि.

The only शास्त्र that can be deployed to give a ruling about the  
appropriateness of a word to its meaning is the शास्त्र of commonly  
agreed usage. That शास्त्र certainly is not grammar or etymology.  
These only 'explain' the usage, not 'create' it. 'अनङ्ग for Cupid'  
has the force of usage behind it. It needs nothing else, certainly  
not the crutch of रूढि. Another word like विदेह or अशरीर will not  
convey that meaning, grammatically more correct though they may be.

A modern example can illustrate the meaning behind शास्त्रात्  
रूढिर्बलीयसी. Where clock faces use Roman numerals to show hours from  
1 to 12, 4 is IIII and not IV. Now we all agree that 4 is IV and IIII  
is, in any other context, incorrect. Yet, in the context of clock  
faces, we continue to use IIII instead of the more शास्त्रपूत IV,  
because of the force of रूढि, which alone justifies it.
