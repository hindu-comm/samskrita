Dear Bala,

  

Please open a new topic as these two are technical terms related exclusively to Vedanta, than general group words and not at all related to the topic of this thread. Many books have been written on Vedanta, and there are glossaries too on technical terms. It may be beyond the scope of a mere thread or message to assess the different aspects of these two concepts and it is not accepted by all universally.
