For रूढि: \<Monier-Williams dictionary under gives, among other  
meanings, \* "tradition, custom, general prevalence, current usage  

(esp. of speech)" and \* "(in rhet.) the more amplified or popular or  

conventional meaning of word in such a meaning (as opp. to योग ,  
q.v.)">  
  
For योग, he says \<the connection of a word with its root, original or  
etymological meaning, (as opp. to rUDhi q.v.)>  
  
As correctly observed by Shreevatsa we should look at the योग-रूढि  
divide, if at all we have to look at anything, and not the शास्त्र-  
रूढि divide. That rules out the thought that 'अनङ्ग is Cupid' is so  
because शास्त्रात् रूढिर्बलीयसी.  
  
Now coming to the योग-रूढि divide, it looks like a very thin line but  
I would say that a word is रूढि-based when it has nothing beyond  
'tradition, custom, general prevalence, current usage' to attach it to  
its meaning. Going back to the common-life example given by me  
earlier, the number '4' on clock-faces is 'IIII' only because of  
'tradition, custom, general prevalence, current usage'. Take that  
away and '4' is 'IV' everywhere else. it is a true case of रूढि.  
'अनङ्ग is Cupid', on the other hand, has the story of being rendered  
'body-less' by Shiva. It has something to fall back upon and does not  
have to invoke रूढि to justify its meaning.
