Very silly questions. When meanings are acquired by usage, rather than etymology, and liable to a wide range of meanings depending on the context, how can there be perfect synonyms?



If you want to use any word in any meaning, there is no question to be asked. You have to understand the meaning of the words from actual usage in a standardized language first. Only few hundred words are strictly derived as participles from the verbs. If we cannot, we can accept the meanings recorded in the lexicons which are supposed to collect the meaning from a wide range of literature than available now.

  

While अङ्गज is used in the sense of काम, तनूज or तनूजन्म is used for the son and तनूरुह is used for hairs and कररुह is used for fingers and nails. All almost having the same meaning either the part of body or body. While some are interchangeable, some are not.

  

अङ्ग पदे लक्षणे च, अगि गतौ there are two verbs. अङतीति अङ्गम्; अङगति अमिन् अवयवी इति अङ्गम् - used in the sense of part of a whole. There is not any whole thing, separate from the parts. In the body, it is true. There is not a whole body other than the parts. As a whole, it is called body. How can this be denied, the word is used in the sense of body when lexicons attest its from the literature? There is nothing in the etymology to restrict its use to denote only the part and avoid its usage to the whole body comprised of the parts. Both would move together, and not the parts only, unless the parts are cut off and taken away. Just have commonsense, while questioning.

  

As for Ananga, it is established by usage as denoting काम and in other senses of sky and and also खेचर. As already said, विदेह is originally related to निमि, as per the Puranic accounts and then extended to the kings of his dynasty and then to the King Janaka, who is popular than his ancestors and who is well-known to us through his daughter वैदेही. It is never used nor noted in the lexicons as used for काम. In the same way if अदेह is used in respect of काम in literature or recorded in any lexicon, you can freely use them. Otherwise, it will mean only body-less and not अनङ्ग used for काम even though both mean the same.

  

Just search how many meanings you get for the word अङ्ग before posting any query:

in the above link and check the meaning in each of the usages in its context. It is not contained to selected ones given in the earlier posts.
