Thanks for the fine analysis of the three words. There are many more things in Indian Literature, which one could explore to derive meanings for the words. Dictionaries give only conventional meanings and grammars add many more in addition to legends. Since the topic has wandered around the various aspects of the three words, I think I can add some more details from my side:

  

In support of Arvindji's explaination, of the term अनङ applied to काम otherwise known as मदन, the popular verse of Kalidasa can be quoted which beautifully captured the incidence:

  

क्रोधं*प्रभो संहर संहरेति*यावद् गिरः खे मरुतां चरन्ति ।

तावत् स वह्निर्भवनेत्रजन्मा भस्मावशेषं मदनं चकार॥३.७२॥

  

This justifies the epithet अनङ्ग used in masculine gender to refer to मदन or काम. Next, as for the meaning of अ (नञ्) in used in बहुव्रीहि and तत्पुरुष generally used in respect of anything without parts or body. As the quotation from Amara seems to suggest:

*"अङ्गं प्रतीको ऽवयवः"*before recording the synonyms of body after अथ गात्रं संहननं वपुः. So it is used for limbs and then extended in use applied to parts of anything. As well, both अङ्ग and अपघन are used assynonymsfor body also by extension as noted byहलायुध :

  

"अङ्गं वपुर्वष्म पुरं च पिण्डं क्षेत्रं च घनश्च मूर्तिः" ( २.३५५)

  

Furhter, the अव्यय नञ् itself can be used to convey different shades of meaning:

  

प्राचीनास्तु

\`तत्सादृश्यमभावश्च तदन्यत्वं तदल्पता।  
अप्राशस्त्यं विरोधिश्चनञर्थाःषट् प्रकीर्त्तिताः।।’  
1. सादृश्य – अब्राह्मणः, अनिक्षुः. 2. अभाव – अज्ञानम्, अक्रोधः, अनङ्गः, अकण्टकः, अघटः. 3. भेद – अपटः,. 4. अल्पता – अलवणम्, अनुदरा ,. 5. अप्राशस्त्य – अकालः, अकार्यम्,. 6. विरोधि – अनीतिःअसितः

  

This makes clear the compound it can be used to denote different things. अनङ्गम् - अनवयवम्, निरवयवम्, without parts, indivisible in the neuter gender used to denote मनस् according to मेदिनी lexicon as quoted in शब्दकल्पद्रुम -.

  

अङ्ग्यते विषयो बुध्यते अनेनेति व्युत्पत्त्या, "अङ्गं मनसि काये च"
इत्यभिधानान्तरदर्शनात्, यथा माघे - "हिरण्यगर्भाङ्गभुवं ददर्श".

  

मेदिनी gives many more meanings:

  

अङ्गं गात्रे प्रतीकोपाययोः पुंभूम्नि नीवृति।

क्लीबैकत्वे त्वप्रधाने त्रिष्वङ्गवति चान्तिके॥

  

The first lists the twopopularusages for limbs and body equally. The rest lists the meanings, as means, and plural masculine used for a country, and in neuter to denote subsidiary or unimportant and the whole comprised of parts and nearness.

  

This explains how the interpretations by the philologists Hellenksy and Parpola need not be correct in all respects..

It would be fine for comparative linguistics or philology. This is in reply to someone's request for a remark on the quoted portions on अनङ्ग.

  

This being so, it may be strange to note that अङ्गज also denotes अनङ्ग denotes काम as the following Bhagavata verse makes it clear:

  

BhāgavPur, 3, 12, 30.2  

yas tvaṃ duhitaraṃ gaccher**anigṛhyāṅgajaṃ**prabhuḥ //and also Narayaniya interpreting the above episode of Bhagavata:

  
धर्मादिकानभिसृजन्नथ कर्दमं च  
वाणीं विधाय विधिरङ्गजसंकुलोऽभूत् ।  
त्वद्बोधितैस्सनकदक्षमुखैस्तनूजै-  
रुद्बोधितश्च विरराम तमो विमुञ्चन् ॥८॥

  

In this case, it can be both मनसिज, and अङ्गज synonyms. अङ्ग as used for body is clearly mentioned in the above quoted lexicons and the examples above in the sense of अङ्गज born in body or mind.

  

  

  

As for Videha, it is a different thing, etymologically though Apte has given some sort of etymology. It was applied to the first King of "Videha" dynasty, called "nimi". As for the derivation, विगतो देहः, he was made to lose his body by curse by Vasistha and who in turn cursed him also. Both got their bodies, permanently, while Vasistha was reborn to attain his body as the son of duo मित्र and वरुण, by ऊर्वशी in the hermitage of अश्विनी gods by some of their surgery skill or magic spell. Nimi lost his body for ever, and still lives in the eyes, eye-lids called by his name "निमेष" blinking of the eyes. This information is according to two slightly different sources in मत्स्यपुराण and विष्णुपुराण. His country also called विदेह after him. So the king of विदेह also called विदेह and the father of सीता, called सीरध्वज also one of the kings of विदेह. So सीता is called वैदेही. That much for the post of Arvindji's explanation.

  

And one query was asked about विदेह-मुक्ति the liberation after the falling of the body, i.e. death. This term is used with different connotations in philosophical schools. This is one of the concepts related to re-birth, liberation from the cycle of death and birth after the falling away of body. In other schools, it is called विदेहकैवल्य, विदेहलय also.



And the last one अशरीर is also used in different contexts with different connotations.

  

*अशरीरं वाव सन्तं*न प्रियाप्रिये(प्रियाप्रिये न) स्पृशतः (छान्दोग्योपनिषत् ८।१२।१)– इति

  

has got a different connotation "the soul different from the body". If it is adjective, it should be अशरीरिणी वाक् by itself it won't convey the voice in the sky as mentioned by someone. Here also the context of the usage decides the meaning and shades of meaning. "अशरीरो ऽमृतः" etc.

  

Hope this message got too many things in relation to the three words enough to bore the members.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/914b311a25b3bb50/32B.gif?part=0.1)

  

Sorry if you find it boring. Please ignore it in that case.
