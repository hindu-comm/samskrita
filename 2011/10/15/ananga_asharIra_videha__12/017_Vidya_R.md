namaste!

  

Generally speaking, just becauseअङ्गज  = मनसिज,  it does not makeअङ्ग = मनस्  (In some particular case, it may be the case).

  

Just as:पङ्कजम् and अम्बुजम् both refer to the flower lotus.  

पङ्क is mud. अम्बु is water.

In one case, the reference is to lotus growing in mud (slush), and in the second case, the reference is to it growing in water (a water body like lake, pond ...).

  

Just because both results refer to the flower lotus, it does not make the source the same - mud and water.

  

Anything that can be born of the mind can be called manasija. Anything born of an 'anga' can be called angaja. - Other aspects have been laid out by others earlier.

  

pankaja generally refers to Lotus. It can be used by a poet to refer to anything that is born out of mud -> I believe, frogs, grass, insects ... may be referred to as being born of mud. But, by popular reference, pankaja refers to lotus.
