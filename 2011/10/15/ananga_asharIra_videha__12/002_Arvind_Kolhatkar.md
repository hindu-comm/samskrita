Dear Group,

This is precisely what I had said in the other thread about studying a  
scripture solely relying on dictionary/machine translation.

विदेह and अनङ्ग have their own contexts from ancient literature.  
विदेह usually refers जनक, father of सीता or वैदेही, अनङ्ग refers to  
the story of शिव burning him by opening his तृतीय नेत्र, thus making  
him 'body-less', as he disturbed him in तपस्.

In a literal sense they three words have the same meaning. We employ  
one or the other depending on the context. It will be wrong to call  
अनङ्ग Cupid as विदेह only because they, in a strict literal sense,  
have the same meaning.
