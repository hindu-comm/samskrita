Subtle differences, since अङ्ग, शरीर and देह are not perfect synonyms, neither are the prefixes अ and वि. विदेह can be parsed as विशिष्टो देहो यस्य सः and also विकृतो देहो यस्य सः.  
  
Having said that, अनङ्ग and अशरीर are generally used for काम. अशरीर is also used for a संन्यासी. But विदेह is generally not used for Kama and almost exclusively used for the जनक kings including सीरध्वज जनक. In this context, विदेह is parsed as विगतो देहो देहसम्बन्धो देहाभिमानो वा यस्य सः (refer the etymology given in Apte's Sanskrit dictionary).  
  
An interesting example is the use of the term विदेह as both the noun (for जनक) and as the adjective is in this *Yamaka* figure of speech by Tulsidas in Ramcharitmanas (1.215.8)  
  
मूरति मधुर मनोहर देखी । भयउ बिदेह बिदेह बिशेषी ॥  
On seeing the pleasant and enrapturing form of Rama, Videha (the king) became especially Videha (unconscious of his body, or free from देहाभिमान). Note that in several Prakrits including Awadhi, व becomes ब and ष is pronounced as ख.
