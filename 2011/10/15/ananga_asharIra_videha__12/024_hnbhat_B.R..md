An small correction. It is conventional meaning in semantics against etymological meaning. The popular saying is "योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी" as applied to Literature. It is similar to the concept of literal and literary meaning of any word. In respect of शास्त्र such a convention is not accepted. Even if great men violate them, that is considered as their inconsiderate acts साहस and in व्याकरण they are considered as अपशब्द. Grammar is not the science of Meaning and the domain of Semantics is the domain of other शास्त्र-s, न्याय considers of 4 types of words, योग, रूढ, योगरूद, यौगिकरूढ. 

  

Better not to confound independent theories valid in different domains of शास्त्र-s. Each has to be taken in its face value as valid.
