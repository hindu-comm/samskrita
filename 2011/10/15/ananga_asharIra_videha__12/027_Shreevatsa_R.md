What is the difference? Aren't "रूढि" and "usage" synonymous (at least in this context)?

  

For what it's worth, Monier-Williams dictionary under gives, among other meanings,

\* "tradition , custom , general prevalence , current usage (esp. of speech)"

and

\* "(in rhet.) the more amplified or popular or conventional meaning of words , the employment of a word in such a meaning (as opp. to योग , q.v.)"

And Apte gives:

"-6 A tradition, custom, customary or traditional usage; शास्त्राद् रूढिर्बलीयसी 'custom prevails over precept'"

"-8 Popular meaning, conventional acceptation of a word; मुख्यार्थबाधे तद्योगे रूढितो$थ प्रयोजनात् K. P.2; समुदायशक्तिः रूढिः"

"रूढिशब्दः a word which conveys its sense by रूढि (usage) as opposed to योग (etymology)"

  

  

Certainly, going by the योग versusरूढि axis, what we have here is रूढि — the word's meaning being determined by usage and not by etymology.

  

(I agree thatशास्त्र doesn't enter into the picture, and we should look at theयोग-रूढि divide and not theशास्त्र-रूढि divide,but I don't understand the distinction being drawn between"रूढि" and "usage".)
