Depends on the context which these words are used. Otherwise, stand alone, would mean only without body except the first. You can decide upon the context whether they are synonyms of the first or not. You can refer in any dictionary, for all the meanings that can be derived from the above words.  
  
Meanings of Videha:  
  
a king of Videha (esp. applied to Janaka) (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
name of a country (= the modern Tirhut) (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
name of a medical author (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
  
For the second: as noun:  

-   (in rhetoric) absence of the verb in a sentence (Monier-Williams,
    Sir M. (1988)) -   not the body -   the non-body

as adjective both mean the same.
