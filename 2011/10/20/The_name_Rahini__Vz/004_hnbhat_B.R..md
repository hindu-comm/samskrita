I endorse Arvindji's opinion on the other thread. It is the trend to pick up some name from the web pages created by different ethnic groups and cultural habits for their babies and Indian parents seek their meaning from Sanskrit word. Vidya has rightly observed it may be corresponding to रागिणी in Sanskrit, a derived form in Tamil pronunciation. But it doesn't go nowhere near the meanings the party found on the net for the word given by the creators of the name. Except for Sarasvati, for which it somehow it can be adjusted and literally loving one. Technically it stands for the feminine form of राग-s called as रागिणी-s as I had read somewhere.



But this possibility of deriving it from the word रहस् - would be the least one and the possibility of coming nearby to the ones given with the word on the web page, far less. The derived word having रहस्, would be रहस्विनी, like मनस्विनी from मनस्, in many senses possessed of those given for the word रहस्.

  

I don't know why should we spend out time for analyzing such fanciful names found on the net to get the meaning from Sanskrit Grammar in so far as we don't know whether the word was picked up from Sanskrit language or the source is not given by the creators of the page. 

  

We can safely leave it to the satisfaction of the parents if they are happy with the name and its meaning and wish all the success for the new born baby.

  

With all the best wishes to the new born baby.
