For a new born baby, the name "Rahini" (राहिनी) has been proposed.  
Before the naming ceremony, the parents of the child would like to  
know the correct meaning of the word, the Sanskrit root, and any more  
relevant information about this name. On extensive searching of the  
internet, I could not come across any information excepting that the  
word means "Goddess Saraswati" in one place and "true living" or  
"rightful living" in another, without naming any source. The word is  
also not mentioned in any Sanskrit dictionaries I consulted. I also  
hope the name Rahini is correctly spelt in devnagari..  
  
I would very much appreciate if the learned members of this group  
could throw some light on the required information, including the  
correct spelling in devnagari.  
  
Thanking you
