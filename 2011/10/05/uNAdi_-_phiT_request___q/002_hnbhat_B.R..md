Just like उणादि सूत्र-s ascribed to शाकटायन in relation to etymology for deriving nouns from verbal roots, these sets of सूत्र-s headed by फिष् - nom. plural - फिषः, are known by फिट्सूत्र-s collection of rules governing accents assigned to प्रातिपतिक-s in theVedic texts. in 4 Chapters ascribed to शन्तनवाचार्य. This is part of सिद्धान्तकौमुदी book appendices, like गणसूत्र, उणादिसूत्र, धातुपाठ etc. Panini deals at random with derivation of the words and selected classification based on suffixes. This is supposed to cover whole of the Vedic vocabulary.

  

I have attached the relevant part of सिद्धान्तकौमुदी with सुबोधिनी commentary as pdf file if it फिट्s you to understand Sanskrit Words.
