The simple answer is that the suffixes are primarily added to verbs (to their stem form) to derive primary participles and other verbal forms in so far as they are simply participle forms. In the case of substantive nouns and other noun forms in the language, they are treated differently by two different schools. Some hold the extremist view, that all the nouns could be related some verbal root to analyze its form into root + suffix. This doesn't take into the consideration of the meaning attached to them, otherwise in obvious participle forms of the verbs past, present or future. The extended usage is standardized by conventions of the use of the words. Paniniian school generally analyze into root and verbs wherever it is closer in meaning to that of the verb. Otherwise, forced analysis is another thing and allowed as a rule. Many words so analyzed won't have any relevance to the meanings of their verbal forms some time far removed. They are treated in different semantic categories and analyzed by Logicians according to meaning.

  

During the process, many phonetic changes are opt to occur and in the final form inflected in use in languages take their forms according to case-endings undergoing several process of phonetic changes under the process. 

  

Further, the nouns can be compounded with other words as long as 2 or three pages, or restricted to denote specific referent objects like त्रिनयन, महेश्वर etc. This is the process of deriving words. Secondary suffixes are added to both nouns to derive get modified forms with different semantic purports. For example, दशरथ is the name of a King, and his son is called दाशरथि. This forms a large part of Panini's grammar. Mainly the description of the forms in use in the contemporary language was the objective of Panini's Grammar which later conveniently standardized to be a prescriptive one.

  

The other school, considering every noun could be derived to a verbal root, is mainly the option of the Nirukta school, in defining the words in Vedic texts. They have in their point the meaning of the hymns to be explained and with reference to the massive Vedic Literature their meaning of prime importance. There is a discussion of both the above views and a conciliatory method is followed in the Nirukta of Yaska.

I think this is theoretically possible in the modern spoken languages which do not have restrictive system of etymology. In Sanskrit, the grammatical principles can be used to some extent to coin new equivalents of the words of other languages and some attempts were made in the past to produce all the technical terms of English in Sanskrit Language. This has been a matter of discussion in another group of scholars. This is a leeway as there are restriction of Grammar rules limited to the words used in Sanskrit language highly inflectional. But the loan words would not meet the requirements of the existing Sanskrit Grammar wrote 2000 years ago based on the contemporary language or restricted to literary use of the language. Many loan words are used in Astronomy and astrology which could not be explained by the standardized grammar rules. These are found in the relevant works and never seems to be used in literary usage of the language because of the inconvenience of adapting the foreign words in to the framework of Sanskrit Grammar.
Still now, it is practically impossible as Sanskrit is not a spoken language in its linguistic sense. In fact, any thing read can be spoken (which is a faculty of speech) and many would like to call Sanskrit a spoken language which can be learnt in 10 days duration. All the foreign words could be accommodated without inflections normal for Sanskrit words based on Grammar. This is the practical view.
