Hi,  
Can learned members of this group help me in understanding the  
principals involved in derivation of Sanskrit words. How are words  
derived. Are words derived from verbs or nouns? How can new words be  
derived from Grammatical rules.?What are the primary sutras that one  
need to understand to coin new words. Can words from other languages  
be added to existing Sanskrit words based on Grammatical principals  
  
Thanks in advance  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
