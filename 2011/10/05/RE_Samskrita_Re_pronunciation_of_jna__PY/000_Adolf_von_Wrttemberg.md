"If we accept that Sanskrit is phonetic then ज्ञ which is ज्+ञ should be pronounced as ज्+ञ (near to "jnya")."

Agreed! In Indo-European linguistics, my avocation, NOT my vocation, this is the only possible pronunciation. One of the many great beauties of Sanskrit is its phonetic quality. To be sure pronunciation changes "creep in" in various regional variants, but let's not forget that there is a scientific reason why we know exactly how Sanskrit was pronounced, viz. because of the physiology of the vocal apparatus. I state that based upon my vocation as a retired medical research doctor. In the case of two other classical languages, Greek and Latin, there are certain phonetic questions, e.g. whether Latin had a nasal sound or not. However, we know that Sanskrit had nasals!

Dhaval,

I am sure grammarians will have a more authoritative answer but the following is what I think.

I do not think there can be a 'final' answer to this and similar other issues of pronunciation. A 'gold standard' for pronunciation does not exist even today, with all help of technology, for any language.  
English, for example, has several styles of pronunciation, each held as a standard in its own region. The 'American' English is different from the 'Australian' variety and both are miles away from the 'King's English'. The 'Indian' variety of English has further subdivisions based on the regional differences

In the case of pronunciation of Sanskrit words, the problem is further complicated by hundreds of years of local traditions and influences of vernacular languages.

I would go a step further and say that I doubt whether a 'standard'  
pronunciation ever existed even in the distant past because the same reasons that explain the difference today were always present even in the past. Since recording sounds was not invented, we may perhaps never know how letters such as ज्ञ, ष, ळ were pronounced, either universally or even regionally. That is why ज्ञ is dnya in Maharashtra and gya in North India, or ष is Sha in Maharashtra but is kha for Brahmins of Mithila. A Vedic chanting tells you upon hearing it whether the Brahmin reciting it is from South India or elsewhere.  
सर्व becomes सर्ब्ब in a Sanskrit text printed in Bengal.

The placement of a letter in the list of alphabets and the descriptions of classes of letters such as ओष्ठय, तालव्य, मूर्धन्य help to some extent but that orderly scheme does not render much assistance for the 'rogue' letters like ज्ञ, ष, ळ.

Some people are prone to approach this issue from a 'jingoistic' point of view. They hold their own style of pronunciation as the 'learned'  
way and deride all others as country yokels, little realizing that differences in pronunciation are inherent.
