In Tamil there are "Kuttriyalukaram" and "Kuttriyalikaram". In fact in many cases where a word especially a sentence ends in the hrasva letters "lu" or "li" the hrasva is further shortened and pronounciation is known as "Kuttriyalukaram and "Kuttriyalikaram".Arethe Sanskrit " ऋ " and
"लृ" closer to Kuttriyalukaram and Kuttryalikaram.The answerwould enable me to relate to Tamil sounds and to that extent easier to pronounce.
