To add a Gujarati perspective to ongoing discussion,

The Gujarati language uses ळ (ળ in gujarati) as a substitute for ल only..

I dont think anywhere it is used as a substitute for ड or ढ.

Might be the same with Marathi..

  

So, do these present day Gujaratiળor Marathi ळ have the same pronounciation which vedic time ळ as a substitute for ड would have been ??
