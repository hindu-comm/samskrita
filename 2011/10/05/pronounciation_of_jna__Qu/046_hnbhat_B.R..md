Thanks for the prompt answer. I am not sure whether it is different from the allophone of डused in Devanagari ळ in the texts of ऋग्वेद as per the प्रातिशाख्य verses quoted in this thread. Please check the articulation points described in the the verse and the description of it in the commentary whether it is proper for it.

  

Regarding, short vowels of e and o, I am also told by Sriramana personally that there is some reference to these though he could not at the time given the reference. Thanks for the link.
