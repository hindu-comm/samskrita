In this case the pronounciation of ञ as second part of the conjoint is difficult..

It is practically not seen in literature.

Everywhere it is seen as first part of conjoint letter only.

(Of course other than ज्ञ)

  

Therefore some audio would be necessary to clarify how this 'jnya' is pronounced..

  

Comments are welcome
