Telugu does have La, and we have difficult following geetha press books, where kALi (as in telugu) is written as kAli. :-). Same with kaLyANi.  
  
Telugu village names though, end with lli and not LLi. So banagAnapalli is correct form as far as telugu is concerned.  
  
Regarding ऋ, I have an interesting observation. When the veda mantras are taught, for the words begining with ऋ , the tradition has been that it is pronounced as aR. ( i am emphasizing the presence of a). However, recently i learnt that there is no concensus on this either. I was told that some examiners (when you are giving an exam for a samhita patha), insist that you pronounce as if its an r. These are not smaller examiners, mind you. My Guru, himself both a vedic and sanskrit scholar, told me that there is a 'mata bheda' as far as this is concerned. :-).  
  
Though not with the pronounciation. Telugu has additional alphabets (I guess other languages have too) - There are dIrgha forms for ऋ, ए, ओ. I found it initially difficult to adjust. how will you pronounce एकम् and ओषदिः with a hraswa ए, ओ written as text ? You do pronounce with the corresponding dIrgha letters. May be there is a rule that governs these.  
  
Thanks
