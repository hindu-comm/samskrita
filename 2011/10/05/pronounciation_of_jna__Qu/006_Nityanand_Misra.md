1.  Charles Wikner discusses the phonetics of ज्ञ in the document
    <http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tutorial_wikner/wikner-rm.pdf>
    (see section 7.A.5 on page 57). He also provides methods to
    pronounce the other "differently pronounced" or "mispronounced"
    sounds like ऋ, लृ, et cetera. I especially found his notes on ऋ very
    useful, as an analogue of the ऋ sound exists in some East European
    languages. क्ष and ज्ञ are easier to master since we know how the
    individual consonants are pronounced - most Indians correctly
    pronounce ष and ञ when speaking words like कष्ट and कञ्ज. ऋ and लृ
    are more difficult, but the phonetic guide by Wikner makes it easy -
    note that Wikner is a South African is not biased by regional
    pronunciation variants. 2.  I have my doubts if ळ was originally a part of Vedic Sanskrit or
    crept in later with some schools pronouncing some Vedic words
    differently. Shiva Sutras and Paninian grammar do not have the
    sound. I do not know if the other eight grammars (Aindra, Chandra,
    etc) have it. Vedic was probably never spoken in common parlance,
    but for Panini to have a so many rules for Vedic phonetics,
    phonology and morphology but to omit out a sound seems a bit odd. 3.  Maybe what one of the scholars here could do is supplement a
    phonetic guide like that by Wikner with audio recordings which are
    free from the influence of regional languages and upload the
    recordings as .ogg files on Wikimedia Commons. Add to that the
    discussion of संवृत and विवृत अ (i.e. record the last Sutra of
    Ashtadhyayi) and then after feedback from peer reviewers, one could
    add the sound recordings on the Wikipedia page on Sanskrit.
