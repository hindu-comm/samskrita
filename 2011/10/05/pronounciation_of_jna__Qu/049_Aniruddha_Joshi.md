Hi,  
  
I would like to quote an interesting word in Marathi:  

-   **कळण =** **\[kaḷaṇa\]** whose meaning is as follows:*n* C Decoction
    or broth of some pulse. 2 also कळणा *m* The powder and fragments
    amongst split pulse.  

 Ref: (<http://marathi.indiandictionaries.com/meaning.php?id=10314&lang=Marathi>)  
  

-   Another variant of this word is **कढण or कढवण** , meaning almost the
    same, viz. *n* (कढविणें) Something boiled down, a decoction; esp.
    broth of some pulse or grain.  
      
    Ref:
    (<http://marathi.indiandictionaries.com/meaning.php?id=10314&lang=Marathi>)

Interestingly, in some forms of Marathi (also, in the one that I speak), the word **कळण/कढण** is pronounced as **कळ्हण**, having the same meaning.  
  

This perhaps indicates the movement **ळ्ह -->** **ढ** or **ळ**. This is just my guess. The learned members may be able to shed some light on it.  
  

Thanks and Regards,
