There are other works on phonetics on the recitation of the Vedic Texts called प्रातिशाख्य-s and शिक्षा-s of which only we know पाणिनीयशिक्षा ascribed to पाणिनि through our learning in the beginning stages through सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, as अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः etc. in so far as they are intended to be a guide to the pronunciation of the letters in the माहेश्वरसूत्र with their relevance to consider स्थान and यत्न in the substitutions for the वर्ण-s mutually सवर्ण, as required by the rule स्थानेऽन्तरतमः, and तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्। Otherwise, there is no complete description of articulation of Vedic usage or their variations. Even प्रातिशाख्य-s do not agree each other as they are different from शाखा to शाखा like the separate शिक्षा-s recording the articulation practices of their related शाखा. That is why Panini never touched the question of articulation points in any of his सूत्र-s except random reference to other schools as in "लघुप्रयत्नतरः शाकटायनस्य"(८।३।१८. ) in quoted in respect of the semi-vowels y, and v. We still do not have any orthographic symbol for this variation than writing य and व. The same with य, व, ल are the same, but classified as अनुनासिक and अननुनासिक but never we have a different orthographic representation for these than we know it during the operation for the relevant सूत्र for सन्धि operation, in the example विद्वाँल्लिखति. So in all probably script is short of all the variations of articulations available and while those only in currency are provided with additional symbols like ळ, ज्ञ etc.



I don't think none of us have access to all the प्रातिशाख्य-s enough to quote some authority on the pronunciation variations of each शाखा nor all the प्रातिशाख्य texts are still surviving of the शाखा-s listed at the time of पतञ्जलि as recorded at his time.

  

As the commentaries like सायण deal with meaning and relevant Grammatical forms to derive the meaning quote the relevant Grammatical rules at random, but mostly draw on निरुक्त of यास्क for deriving their meaning and the semantic contents supported from the massive Vedic Literature. So there is no wonder, if he doesn't consider it worth to comment on the articulation differing to each शाखा. Like this, each of the commentators have their own objective in explaining the Vedic sentences and in deciding the purport of the whole prakaraNa, instead of each words in isolation they have their own standards than the articulation points involved. निरुक्त had already laid down a guiding principle:

  

नैकं पदं निर्ब्रूयात्। = any word (he is concerned with Vedic vocabulary) is to be explained in isolation (out of context ) and the the purport of a प्रकरण or अधिकरण is decided on the following factors:

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारावभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम्।

अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये॥

  

So there is nothing to wonder if they do not dwell on the issue of articulation of different letters. One can swarm through the massive प्रातिशाख्या-s and शिक्षा-s including the one ascribed to पाणिनि.

  

Similar was the question with the pronunciation of ब्रह्म, चिह्नम् etc. Panini himself didn't ever touch the point expressed in his शिक्षा -

  

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तःस्थाभिश्च संयुतम्।

औरस्यं तं विजानीयात् कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम्॥

  

we know only the कण्ठ्य of ha as we are fed by our grammar works dealing with classical Sanskrit.

  

I think this will throw some light in this respect. I myself am not conversant with Vedic Grammar as laid down in प्रातिशाख्य-s or शिक्षा meant for Vedic grammar and articulation purposes exclusively.
