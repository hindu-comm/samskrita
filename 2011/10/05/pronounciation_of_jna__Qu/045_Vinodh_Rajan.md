For now, I can attest personally attest that I have seen ழ in Jaiminiya Sama Veda Passages in Devanagari Script (used modified ड), Grantha Script(Printed & Manuscript)and Malayalam Script (Manuscript). It occurs as the allophone of ड.

  

(I have the scans... have to dig in for them :-/ )

  

The erstwhile Kanchi Shankaracharya has also mentioned this in his work "Dheyvaththin Kural" (தெய்வத்தின் குரல்).

  

As for Hrasva e,o, if I can recall correctly, Mahabhashya has references to it. There is also a paper by Abyankar which discusses this issue. It occurs as allophone of 'a'.

  

*1957, "Short /e/ (/ardha ekāra/) and short /o/ (/ardha okāra/) in  
Sanskrit", ABORI 38: 154-7*

  

(I have the PDF somewhere, have to search again :-/ )

  

There is a article in Sanskrit referring to these phones by the Vedic Scholar Shriramana Sharma, a friend of mine. Below is the links -

The Article is titled -

  

किं संस्कृते ह्रस्व एकारः ओकारो वा अस्ति ?

  

It can be downloaded from the above website.
