Post script to my earlier message:

  

In so far it doesn't change their meaning native language Sanskrit. It is with this view a father advised his son to learn Grammar:

  

यद्यपि बहु नाधीषे तथापि पठ पुत्र व्याकरणम्।  
स्वजनो श्वजनो माऽभूत् सकलं शकलं सकृत् शकृत्॥  
  
“Son, even if you do not learn much, yet, do study grammar, so that स्वजन (a relative) does not become श्वजन (a dog), nor सकल (the whole) शकल (a broken piece) and सकृत् (one time) शकृत् (ordure). “

  

Thanks to Arvind Kolhatkar for the translation in his comments in one of SL Abhyankar's संस्कृताध्यन lessons. The difference in meaning is clear in the above pairs.

  

Otherwise, there is no problem how you pronounce, even though शिक्षा lays down some descriptions of articulations as Panini himself is silent on this point in his Grammar.

  

Hope this will be convenient for all those who pronounce Sanskrit letters as they use to pronounce the cognates of them in their language and want it to be brought under the rules of Grammar.
