Murthy Mahodaya

ळ occurs only in Vedic texts as far as I am aware and not in classical Sanskrit.

अग्निमीळे is correct – pada version is “agnim īḷe purohitam”.

īḷe is 1 sg pres Atmanepada of root īḍ - When the consonant retroflex ḍ occurs between two vowels it becomes ḷ and ḍh becomes ḷh (this partially elides the consonant with the vowels occurring before and after so it is easier to say)

“I magnify Agni the household priest”. The first line of Rgveda.

But this does not occur for semivowels such as y and v.

So: īḷe, but īdya, and mīḷhuṣe, but mīḍhvān
