Hello,

  

I am surprised that you think so (La being of marathi origin and that it is certainly not sanskrit origin)

  

In fact the very first rig vedic verse begins with "agni meeLe purohitam" (pronounced as La of marathi and kannada). For some reason this "La" dropped out in subsequent period and was re-placed as "meeDe" (agni meeDe purohitam etc.) in yajurveda

  

  

Regards,

  

narayan
