Does Whitney cite any ancient grammatical text for this rule? Some schools do write and pronounce it as अग्निमीळे, some others as अग्निमीले, some as अग्निमीडे and I even remember seeing अग्निमीड़े in some magazine two years back (using the Prakrit ड़).  
  
Given the lack of ळ in both Shiva Sutras and Ashtadhyayi, the question still remains if the rules of a grammar on Vedic - other than Paninan grammar - or any of the Shiksha texts have the consonant ळ? It is the only consonant in Vedic texts that is absent in Laukika and most Indo-Aryan languages except Gujarati and Marathi.  
  
What is then a more reasonable assumption, or as we statisticians say, the null hypothesis: whether the sound was present in Vedic in the time of revelation (composition if you like) of Rig Veda and vanished later due to some reasons, or it developed later as a pronunciation variant in some Vedic schools?  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
