I don't think there is any problem in pronunciation. But only regional language and Prakrit language pronunciations interfere which are mistaken for correct pronunciation of the conjuncts unfamiliar in other words or less familiar in their languages.

  

नञ्वियुक्तस्य नञा सह समासः।

  

यजयाचविच्छप्रच्छरक्षो नङ्

  

याच्ञा (yAc-\~nA), has got ञ् as the second consonant in the conjunct just in the same way as in यज्ञ (yaj-\~na). If there is no problem with the च्+ञ् +अ sequence, what is specific problem with this? Only it has orthographic symbol for representing the conjunct, like क्ष, but probably due to this the popular letter was misrepresented as a new conjunct in the other language using the same ज्ञान as gyAn. Probably the other is also mispronounced, but less used in the regional languages than their own gyAn. यज्ञ is still less used. In Prakrit languages it becomes ण्ण or in the initial position very much simplified for ञान also found in Tamil without even attempting to misrepresent.

  

There is no error in any language in spoken form as it is established by usage. Only literary standardized language need be read under the purview of Sanskrit Grammar.
