I am inclined to disagree. Panini's system has special rules that apply to Vedic language, and Panini is the authority all the commentators from Adi Shankara to Vallabhacharya cite while interpreting Upanishads. I am not sure if Sayana refers to Panini while expounding on the mantras - other scholars can throw some light here.
