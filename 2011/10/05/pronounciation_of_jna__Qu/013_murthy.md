If it were a character recognized by a pronunciation and written symbol, I believe, it would have found a place in Paninian Maheswara sutras. As to how अग्निमीले(डे) is to be pronounced, I agree some schools pronounce it as अग्निमीळे. In my view it does not mean Sanskrit has ळ as a distinct character.
