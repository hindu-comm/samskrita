According to Paninian धातुपाठ the verb is ईड स्तुतौ and declined in the 2nd conjugation group as

  

ईट्टे - ईडाते - ईडते

ईडिषे - ईडाथे - ईडिध्वे।

ईडे - ईडिवहे - ईडिमहे।

  

How it is pronounced as ळे is a case for Vedic pronunciation specialists. जड is also variable with जळज, जलज, जडज etc. "शैत्यं हि यत्सा प्रकृतिर्जडस्य" is a popular saying. So ल, र, ळ are all considered sometimes as variables in certain words. In many words ल is pronounced as ळ in South Indian Languages. Taking them as प्राकृत influence may antagonize वैदिक-s. It is pronounced as अग्निमीळे. but written mostly as अग्निमीडे and commented as such I praise.

  

The same participle form appears in the next

  

अग्निः पूर्वेभिरृषिभिरीड्यो*नूतनैरुत*।

स देवाँ एह वक्षति ॥२॥

  

It is never pronounced as ईळ्य except in Keralite pronunciation. जाड्य is pronunced as जाळ्य also.
