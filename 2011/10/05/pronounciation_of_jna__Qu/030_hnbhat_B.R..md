Here is the text of Pratishakhya:

  

The information onळandळ्हas intervocalic variations ofडandढwill be found in the Ṛkprātiśākhya 1.21 (1.51,52 in M.D.Shastri’s edition) and also inṢaḍguruśiṣya’s commentary on Kātyāyana’s Sarvānukramaṇī on RV.1.28.According to the RP Vedamitra held the place of articulation of ḍ and ḍh to be the root of the tongue and the palate.The verse cited byṢaḍguruśiṣya isअज्मध्यस्थडकारस्यळकारंबह्वृचा जगुः। अज्मध्यस्थढकारस्यळ्हकारं च यथाक्रमं ।।Thusवीळुandमीळ्हुषेbutवीड्वङ्ग.

  

as I was provided from some other group on query.

  

I have already explained why these are not quoted in the commentaries as it is out of the scope of their commentaries with specific objective either by Sayana or Shankara.
