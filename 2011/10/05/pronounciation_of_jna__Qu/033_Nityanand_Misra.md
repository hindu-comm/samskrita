Great, thanks a lot everybody for informing about ऋक्प्रातिशाख्य, I was unaware of the work. Now I know that the उत्क्षिप्त मूर्धन्य syllables ळ and ळ्ह are discussed in ancient वेदाङ्ग works, so it is more likely they disappeared from later Vedas. In other words, my earlier null hypothesis stands invalidated with this critical test-statistic. :)  
  
By the way, what is the equivalent of ळ्ह in modern Indian languages? I don't recall seeing it in Gujarati - am not sure about Marathi and Dravidian languages.
