taking clue from ongoing discussion on ज्ञानेश्वरी,

I would like to float one query...

  

How do we pronounce the letter ज्ञ correctly?

In Gujarat - it closely resembles ग्न

In most hindi speaking states it resembles ग्य..

but the grammar has it ज्‌+ञ

  

so i am curious to know how do scholars speak this letter correctly..

An audio link would be much appreciated..
