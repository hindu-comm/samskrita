You mean in standardized language, they read as they are written. But I was referring to spoken form of the language, which many do not retain the same difference.

  

I remember a comedy of Vivek of the modern news reading. If you have seen, you also might have enjoyed it. Ok. I just casually pointed out, but not with any view of finding fault with Tamil Language. It was long ago lost in Kannada both in written and spoken form, but the difference is still valid in Malayalam Language and they never merge them.
