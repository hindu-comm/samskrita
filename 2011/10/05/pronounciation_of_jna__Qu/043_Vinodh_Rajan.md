Dear Murthy,

  

I suppose you are referring to the following:

  

ಱ - றറఱ

  

ೞ - ழഴ

  

BTW Old Telugu Inscriptions also seems have had the Retroflex Approximant \<ழ ഴ>.

  

Theழ ഴ sound is also present in Vedic Phonology along with the Hrasva e o \<எ ஒ \|ఎ ఒ \|ಎ ಒ \|എ ഒ \>. Even though these are considered as
typical South Indian a.k.a Dravidian Phones, they are prevalent in the Vedic Tongue.
