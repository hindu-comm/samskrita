These were present in manuscripts writing till 18th century and also in print of old Kannada poems in text books.These are transcribed by the side of r - proper R ,and The are cognates for -.ra ர and zh ழ as far as I can gather. Caldwell's Comparative Grammar may help. I was told they were cognates to corresponding Malayalam and Tamil letters, now extinct in Kannada language. These are the two in the two languages not present in Kannada of todayR றand La ள are common to Kannada alphabet today.

  

I am not sure of their correspondence exactly. Some Dravidian Linguist may through light on this.
