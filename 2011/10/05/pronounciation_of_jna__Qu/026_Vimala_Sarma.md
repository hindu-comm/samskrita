NiyAnanda Mahodaya

I am resending this to answer the question “Is there any ancient grammatical text for this rule”. When the Rgveda was written there were no grammatical texts that we know of. It is very important to see things in a historical context (even though traditionalists may not agree) and to see developments over time. The Rgveda goes back a very long time (I won’t give even an approximate date because this will immediately lead to controversy) and is considered the first piece of Indic literature. As the Rgveda SamhitA was complied over a long period of time, it is possible for scholars to see the changes between earlier and later hymns, in structure and phonetic rules. Perhaps because of these inconsistencies, and irregularities, and use of subjunctives etc,
Pannini systematised and laid down rules for a language which was a later development, and led to classical Sanskrit, with the tenses and rules as we now know it. So these rules do necessarily apply to the literature which preceded him, ie the Vedic language. Also there was not written language at the time so the most important thing was the sound – which is of course pronounced with metre and accent, to make it easier to remember orally – (but perhaps not for us living to-day!).
