By the way, what is the equivalent of ळ्ह in modern Indian languages? I don't recall seeing it in Gujarati - am not sure about Marathi and Dravidian languages.  

  

  

Of the Dravidian languages, there are two allomorphs of ळ - and ळ्ह written differently in Malayalam ള and ഴ and Tamil. as ழ and ள. Might have been inherited from Prevedic period in common. But in modern tamil, they do not differentiate between and pronounce as  ळ only. But these words are purely Dravidian design or loan words फल becomes pazha. both in Malayalam and Tamil alike. It is allomorph of ल and not of ड or ढ of Sanskrit. For writing the above Vedic words, they use the same system as ळ and ळ्ह with "h" added to the ळ as in Sanskrit in Kannada script. Even though it is there, there is no special orthographic symbol for the second in Kannada. But I am not sure of Malayalam which has all symbols for the Sanskrit alphabet plus its own letters. In Kannada, it is writeen as ಳ್ಹ as in Devanagari. But there were corresponding two symbols as in the two other sister languages script, in modern language, only one is retained in Kannada. Probably the same in Telugu also. For pronunciation, it is also उत्क्षिप्तमूर्धन्य or its variety.

  

The above are just a guess. Not based on any evaluation of samples.
