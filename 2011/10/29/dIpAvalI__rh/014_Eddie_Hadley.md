Dr,



==>

But none of the Sanskrit dictionaries give the word as the name of the festival observed by Indians today as a celebration of one or other episodes in the Purana-s in the cultural background of the word.

I’m no expert on the Purāṇas, but would this be the same battle of good v evil:



dīpotsava

 • m. a festival of lights, BhavP. \[481,2\]



 The reference is to Bhavishya , ii Kh. (Bhavishya- & °yôttaraP.), but a cursory search has not located the word there.
