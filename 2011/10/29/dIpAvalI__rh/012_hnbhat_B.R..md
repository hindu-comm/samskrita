Very Good Observation. You can take and interpret any word in your own way.

  

Thanks for your comments.

  

I don't think none of the postings do refer to this possibility. 

  

But none of the Sanskrit dictionaries give the word as the name of the festival observed by Indians today as a celebration of one or other episodes in the Purana-s in the cultural background of the word.

  

Thanks for all illuminating replies.
