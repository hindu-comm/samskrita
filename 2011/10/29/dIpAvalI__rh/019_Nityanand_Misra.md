Not Grandpa but more likely father or Pa. Taata primarily means father, though in its general sense it means any male relative in Sanskrit including son, brother, uncle or elder like grandfather.

  

A related word is tata which is used for father.

  

Taata in Kannada means grandfather though and is not used for father.
