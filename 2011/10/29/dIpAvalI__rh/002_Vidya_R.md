dIpAvalI = dIpa+AvalI

  

In tamizh also, it is dIpAvalI, except that the l becomes L and (probably the long I becomes a short i) hence dIpAvaLi

  

dIpa + oLi is not correct - it is only a fanciful interpretation by somebody, using a lot of poetic license. Even in tamizh, it would have become dIpauLi, had this been the case.
