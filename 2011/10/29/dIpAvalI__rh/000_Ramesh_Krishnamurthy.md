Namaste,  
  
The word 'dIpAvalI' is usually translated to mean 'row of lamps'. While dIpa = lamp is common in several Indian languages, the rest of the word is not clear. At least, I couldn't find any suitable references in dictionaries such as MW.  
  
In Tamil, the word is often broken up into 'dIpa + oLi', where oLi = light (as distinct from oli = sound), but I have not come across a saMskR^ita basis for this.  
  
Any clues?
