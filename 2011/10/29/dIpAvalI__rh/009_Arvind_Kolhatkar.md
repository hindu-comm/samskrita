Ramesh Krishnamurthy says: \<By the way, MW suggests that the word is

  
Avali and not Avalii, so that'sanother correction to be made.>

MW gives both versions: आवलि and आवली. ShriharSha's play is called  
'रत्नावली'.

I was also reminded of a verse learnt long ago:

आपाण्डुरा: शिरसिजास्त्रिवली कपोले  
दन्तावली विगलिता न च मे विषाद:।  
एणीदृशो युवतयो: पथि मां विलोक्य  
तातेति भाषणपराः खलु वज्रपात:॥

Of course, both दन्तावलि: and दन्तावली could fit equally well in it,  
though I clearly remember it as दन्तावली. This verse is at No 45  
under हास्यरसनिर्देश in सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार, where too the word used  
is दन्तावली.

Marathi has a word 'आळी' which is a part of a town or a row of houses  
that have something in common such as ब्राह्मणआळी. The word 'आळी' is  
derived from आवलि and आवली.
