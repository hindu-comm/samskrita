Very Good humorous verse. Thanks for it. The highlighted word should be युवतयः.

He was not worried at all about the white hairs, or three wrinkles in his face or that he had

no row of teeth left. But it was indeed a great shock to him when the beautiful (with eyes resembling those of deer)

young girls call him as Grandpa (asscrolls) down the street.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/bcabc9c97f7c60e0/360.gif?part=0.1)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/bcabc9c97f7c60e0/360.gif?part=0.1)

It is directly derived from the Sanskrit word आलि or आली like आवलि and आवली.

  

"वीथ्यालिरावलिः पङ्क्तिः" is the attestation from Amara 2.4.5.

And from both the words आली and आवली could be derived without change in the meaning or gender.
