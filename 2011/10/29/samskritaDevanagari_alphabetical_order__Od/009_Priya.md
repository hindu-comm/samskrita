Actually, Panini ensures that the 'm' at the end of a sentence  
remains  
as 'm' and does not switch to anusvara without having to bother about  
script/ sentence issues. The sutra mo'nusvaarah (8.3.23) just  
specifies  
that a 'm' at the end of any word will switch to an anusvaara if it is  
followed  
by a 'hal' i.e. a consonant. And as the 'm' at the end of a sentence  
is not  
followed by anything, it is therefore not followed by a consonant  
either, so  
the 'm' does not switch to anusvaara and remains as 'm'. Hope this  
helps.  
  
As for the difference between anusvaara and half anusvaara (with a  
crescent),  
the first one is a true anusvaara, and the second is referred to as  
anunaasika. To the best of my understanding, anunaasika is a nasalized  
vowel attached to the preceding consonant, and anusvaara is a pure  
nasal  
(naasiko anusvaarasya and nya-ma-nga-Na-na-naam naasika ca).
