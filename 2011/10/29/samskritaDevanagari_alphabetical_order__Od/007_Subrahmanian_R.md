The anuswara occurring before

श ष स ह is pronounced closer to 'm' by South Indians \[samskritam, vamsam, hamsam etc\] while North Indians and across the world \[from the transliterations and also from my interactions with people in Varanasi\] pronounce it closer to 'n'. This ambiguity in pronounciation is a cause as to its position in alphabetical order.



Then what is anuswara and what is half anuswara written with a crescent? Can somebody enlighten me?



The substitution of anuswara \[a dot at the top\] for halanta ma or any other nasal ispermitted only in the middle of a word or middle of combined word. Anuswara in place of halanta ma is permitted at the end of a word but not at the end of line. eg



रामं लक्ष्मणपूर्वजं रघुवरं सीतापतिं सुन्दरम् and not सुन्दरं

I doubt if Panini's grammar extends to the script.
