Charles Wikner, goes into some detail in regards to word order and *anusvāra,* as employed in the MW.



This may be of help:

For *printed material*, Monier-Williams found it necessary to *standardise* the *placement* of words for such dictionaries.

As to ‘word order’, which is more to do with standardising the *form* of the Devanāgarī letters, he explains at some length, in his introduction.



The origin of the alphabetical order itself, goes back in time, and is one for the historians.
