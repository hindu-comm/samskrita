I doubt if Panini's grammar extends to the script.

Anyway the question has been answered differently. I don't think Panini has said anything about the script in his grammar. He has mentioned one word यवनानी secondarily derived word from यवन in the feminine formation suffix which has been interpreted as the script of यवन-s. But not anything about देवनागरी script we use now and in3-2-21 he explains the formation of the word लिपिकर to mean the scribe. Apart from these, he never formed any rules regarding the script.

  

There are many other conventions to present orthographically the forms derived from Vedic Grammar used in writing the Vedic Texts which have already been discussed in another thread meant for it.
