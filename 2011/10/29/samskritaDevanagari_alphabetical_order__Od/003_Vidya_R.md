We are taught / teach akSharamAlA order as :

  

अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ ॠ लृ ए ऐ ओ औ अं अः  

  

The last two - aM and aH of-course cannot occur on their own (as M / H), without a vowel, and can occur with all the vowels (aM AM uM UM, and aH AH iH IH ...) (even though included in the list only with the vowel 'a').

  

When in a word, this 'M' transforms into correspondingवर्गीय-अनुनासिका (ङ् ञ् न् ण् म्) when 'M' is followed by a  वर्गीय-व्यञ्जनम् \| This pushes the word further down the list (alphabetic order) to the specific 'varga'.

  

the visarga occurs rarely embedded in a word, and when it does, it probably appears right after the M (anunAsikA followed by y, r, l, v, sh, Sh, s, h)
