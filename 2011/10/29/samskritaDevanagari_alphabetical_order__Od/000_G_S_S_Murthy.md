Dear all,  

In Sanskrit to another language dictionaries, अनुस्वार followed by य,र,ल,व (अन्तस्थ), श,ष,स (ऊष्म) comes right at the beginning, that is, before क,च,ट,त,प (स्पर्श). For example, अंश comes before अगाध, कंस comes before ककुभ्. What is the logic in this ordering? Perhaps this feature is common for other Indian language dictionaries.

My view is that before the advent of western scholars, Indian languages did not have alphabetical listing. If at all, words were listed based on the end letter as can be seen in अमरकोश.

Scholars could throw light on this.

Regards,
