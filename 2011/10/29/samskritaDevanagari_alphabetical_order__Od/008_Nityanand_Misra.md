Anusvara is a pure nasal sound, as LSK says naasikaa.anusvaarasya

  

Also line and sentence are different - the quarter or [cara.na](http://cara.na) you quoted from raamarak.saastotra in fact ends with anusvaara as it is followed by

  

kaakutstha.m karu.naar.nava.m etc

  

It is common to see anusvaara at end of first and third quarters (what you call lines).
