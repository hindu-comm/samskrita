For this, please see the Table and the narration under 'The  
Dictionary Order of The Nagari Letters' which appears at the beginning  
of Monier Williams' Dictionary.  
  
What I understood from there is that his arrangement has all vowels  
from अ to औ at the beginning, followed by what he calls as 'true  
Anusvara' and visarga, next followed by letters क्, ख् etc. The  
'true Anusvara' is explained by him in the Note below the Table as the  
one appearing before the sibilants श् ष् स्, ह् and semivowels य् र्  
ल् व्.
