It is very simple in logic. In the alphabetical order, the vowel is followed by the next vowel a, i, u etc. which is followed by the consonants. The अनुस्वार and विसर्ग properly do not come within the list of alphabets as listed by Panini, but a form of the nasal consonants before another consonant and aspirate for the "s" in conjunction with a number of sequences of consonants and stand alone at the end of a inflected word. This is the position.

  

To be precise, two vowels a-i do not normally follow usually in a word except in the MaheshvarasUtra-s and some rarelly met words we had met. So before any other consonant in the list of words in the alphabetic order, the अनुस्वार and विसर्ग has to be placed in its own right as it is always attached to a vowel and no other vowel can follow it normally. Hence it is not placed at the end of the list. Anyhow Monier Williams calls the "anusvAra" in its true sense as they are natural ones without any optional assimilation with the following consonant like in the case of consonants क to म with their corresponding nasals. The option is open in the external Sandhi-s and in the case of internal sandhi-s it is obligatory (i.e. aअङ्ग, गङ्गा, डिण्डिम etc) which can be considered as natural of their own, which should follow their order in their वर्ग.

  

It could well be placed after all the consonants following अ in the initial position, well, before the list of आ begins.I remember having seen such order too in some indexes. But in any case, they could not occupy their own place in the alphabetical order after the list words beginning with consonants ends.

  

For a discussion on the reverse Sanskrit Dictionary about the order in Sanskrit Lexicons/Thesaurus, please see this link in another forum:

The निघण्टु and कोश works are a sort of Thesaurus than an alphabetical Dictionary in the modern concept and the purpose served by these कोश works vary in their design according to their subject and most of them in versified form to facilitate memorizing them than a reference work like a modern Dictionary. This point had already been discussed in another thread in this group itself long ago.
