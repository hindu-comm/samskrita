Thanks a lot for the reply but I am sorry the links provided by you is  
not the books I am looking for(i have already mentioned in the first  
post that " i have moola text").  
  
I need the books with the specific commentaries...Hemachandracharya  
wrote his own commentary on abhidhana chintamani and on  
anekarthasangaraha his shishya wrote commentary. I doubt any one have  
edited it or not it may be still in the manuscript form...the rest of  
the books as you told we need trick to find...I used almost all trick  
still could not find....that must be lying in some libraries cos few  
books there already published...and the link for avadanakalpalata is  
missing the initial pages...so i was looking for a scanned copy which  
is published from mithila research institute..even I am ready to buy  
that but I hardly speak hindi or sanskrit or english to contact the  
university.
