Murthy,



 The short answer is ‘yes’.

 At #300 and something in the list is:



|                                 |                                                                                                                                           | |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | **(H1B) दित्य-वह् \[L=92075\]** | *f.* °त्यौही ( Pa1n2. 3-2 , 64 ; vi , 4 , 132 Ka1s3. ) a two-year-old steer or cow VS. TS. (Prob. from दित्य = द्वितीयवह् cf. तुर्य-वह्.) |







and the long answer:



 Not many people know this, but as well as the Sanskrit- English Dictionary by Monier Williams, there is his 859 page English-Sanskrit counterpart.



I have the cheaper, Montilal Banarsidass print. But the print quality is still quite good.





Cow is on page 142 of my 1999 print.



The format is the same viz. the semi-colon delimited, comma delimited sense groupings.

Very much m ore Devanagari, very little English the converse of other one.





leaving out my unreliable Devanagari skills;

 the are entries are grouped in the one place, which is what you are after?



random sample



‘sacrifice of a cow’, ;



‘killing of a cow’, ;





Now, after nearly two decades we can have it both ways.





Eddie.
