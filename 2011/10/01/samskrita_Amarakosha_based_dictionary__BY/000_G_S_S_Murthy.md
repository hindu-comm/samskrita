Dear all,  

Available English- Sanskrit dictionaries miss a large number of specific words that are listed in “Amarakosha”.

For example we have in the general category of “cow” the following words:

द्विहायनी= 2-year old cow; एकहायनी, त्रिहायणी,

चतुर्हायणी, वन्ध्या, अवतोका, संधिनी, प्रष्ठौही, बहुसूतिः, पीनोध्नी, द्रोणक्षीरा, धेनुष्या, समांसमीना .

Of course in a good "Sanskrit-other language" dictionary, all will get listed in their proper places. But if one could get access to such specific words while looking for equivalents to “cow” it would be very useful.

Is there any such “other language to Sanskrit dictionary” which caters to this requirement? In a digitised Sanskrit-English dictionary, one could look for related words by searching for "cow", but it is quite clumsy.  

Regards

Murthy
