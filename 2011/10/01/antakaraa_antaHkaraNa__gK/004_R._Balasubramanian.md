Dear Bhatji and Gargheswariji,



I am very thankful to you both for the information you have provided.



Bhatji, I do have access to S.S.S. Sastri’s translation and gloss on Vedāntaparibhāṣa by Dharmarāja Adhvarin.

Could you kindly direct me to the chapter from which you have provided the quote or the *pramāṇa* under which *citta* is discussed.

Thanks.



\[Sastri, S. S. S. (1971). *Vedāntaparibhāṣa by Dharmarāja Adhvarin.* . Adyar, India: The Theosophical Society\].



Regards.



Bala
