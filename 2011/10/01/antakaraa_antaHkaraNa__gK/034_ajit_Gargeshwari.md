Hi,  
  

**Cit** Consciousness; mind; thought; apperception (from the verb root cit=”to perceive, observe, know”)

· In Kashmir Saivism, the limitation of universal Consciousness manifested in the individual mind. It is the mind of the empirical individual. In Raja yoga, citta means mind and in advaita Vedanta it refers to subconscious.

· In the Vaibhasika system, it is samskrita-dharmas, born out of the interaction of the senses with their objects

· In yogachara system, it is mano-ddharma. It is the primary dharma and essentially the only dharma.

· In the yoga system, the intellect (buddhi), ego (ahankara) and the senses (indriyas) are often called citta

· According to the Sankhya, the mind (citta) has five processes, pramana, viparyaya, vikalpa, nidra amd smriti



**Antah-Karna** the internal organ;inner sense; inner instrument” inner Causes

· It is comprised of the intellect, the mind, the ego and the consciousness( buddhi, mans, ahankara and cit), according to Advaita Vedanta. The Sankhya school recognises only the intellect, mind and ego as comprising the inner organ.

· It is the seat of the functions of the senses as distinct from their outer organs. It receives and arranges what is conveyed to it through the senses. It reflects objects by it relation with the self (purusa) according to Sankhya or by its relation to the self (atman) according to advaita Vedanta.

· According to Advaita Vedanta the perceived variations of different individuals’ cognitions are due to the differences in their respective antahkarnas.

· The inner organ functions by streaming out to an object, illuminating it, assuming its shape, and cognizing it according to advaita Vedanta. This causes antahkarna vritti(again a technical term)



**Buddhi **intellect; the discriminative faculty ( from the verb budh= to enlighten, to know)

· The ascertaining intelligence and the impersonal or superpersonal state of consciousness of a limited individual.

· The first evolute of primordial Nature (Prakriti). It is the basis of intelligence of the individual. It is the determinative faculty and by it one resolves upon a course of action

· According to Nyaya- Vaishesika, it is of two kinds; recollection (smriti) and experience (anubhava)

· Manah- Mind; one of the aspects of the internal organ (from the verb root man = “to think”

· Mind emerges from the pure(sattva) aspect of egoity (ahankara)

· Mind stimulates the other senses to attend to their respective objects.

· Thus it is an organ of cognition and of action. It is the doorkeeper to the senses. Its specific function is to explicate.

· According to Nyaya-Vaisesika, it is atomic and eternal. It is an instrument of knowing and is inert as any other sense. Its cooperation is necessary for all knowledge. It exercises a double function: it helps the self to acquire knowledge and it narrows its field to a single object or group of objects. Association with the mind is the basic cause of bondage.

· According to Jainism, it is not a sense organ, but the organ of cognition of all objects of all the senses. It is of two types physical mind (bhava) which performs the mental functions proper and material mind (dravya), which is a subtle matter compounded into the physical mind.

· According to Dvaita Vedanta and Sankhya the mind is considered as one the sense organs (indriya)

· According to Mimamasa different cognitions are explained by a type of atom called manas. The mind alone brings about cognitions, aversions, efforts etc. Thus it needs the aid of the other organs to cognize these qualities.

**Amankara** ‘I” –ness; egoism; the concept of individuality from the root verb root kr=”action” +aham=”i”) literally= the I maker.

In the evolutionary process ahankara is said to evolve from the intellect (“buddhi”) and give evolutions to the senses (indriya) and the subtle essence of the elements (tanmatras) in turn. Its function is self assertion. It is an aspect of the inner organ (antah Karna) and it has three aspects vaikarika os satva taijasa or Rajas and buddhi or Tamas.

**Aham** “I” ; I-awareness; the notion of the ego; the individual soul; self consciousness ; I consciousness the pure individual self.

There are said to be two Is; the lower self or egotistical individual and the higher self or the pure (suddha) self.

According to Kashmir Shavism, it points to the free and Self illuminating consciousness that resides in the heart.

  

If you find these definitions or thoughts useful we can further discuss ***Saṃyāma***. Probably you need to make new thread
