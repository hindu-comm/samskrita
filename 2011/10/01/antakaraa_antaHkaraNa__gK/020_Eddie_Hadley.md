Ajit,



 Thank you for your reply, but . . .



The Vedanta definitions were quoted, not queried.



The actual request raised was for ‘other tighter definitions in other schools of Indian philosophy?



At least, that’s what my antaḥkaraṇa makes of it.



Moreover, it is my understanding that all scriptures, Indian or otherwise, advice that no amount of debate as to the nature of that which is beyond the comprehension of the antaḥkaraṇa is fruitful, of itself?



Beyond its comprehension, but not beyond its experience.



May those entities, so experienced and attributed with such comprehension, so enlighten us, whatever their schooling.





 Eddie
