Hi,  
The word perception has come to be used for the Sanskrit word Pratyaksha. As regards the exact definition of Pratyaksha, However, there is a marked divergence of opinions among the different schools of philosophy. Leaving aside the various minute differences, One may broadly classify these different views into three types. We have first the Buddhistic view according to which perception is an unerring Knowledge of the unique particular( Nyaya Bindu pp 111-16 Chaukambha edition). We have, further, the large majority of views which consider perception as arising out of the contact of sense with Object ( Nyaya Sutras Chapter 1, Section 1 sutra 4 also Muktavali and sholkavartika). Lastly there is view of the Prabhakaras and Vedantins, and also a section of Naiyayikas, who chareterize perception as immediate knowledge.  
  
The Sanskrit word manas is translated by the English word Miond. The word Manas, like the English word mind, is not used in the same sense by all schools of thinkers. In most of the Schools the phenomenon of of recognition is used as a datum for inferring the existence of rational self--atman ( Nyaya Sutra chapter 3 part 1 sutra 1 and chapter 3 Section one sutra 7 also Vivarna-prameya Sangraha page 188 Vizagam Sanskrit series)  
  
According to Orthodox schools, we find that the prabhakaras, the Bhattas, The Samkhya, the Naiyayikas and Vaisheshikas all agree in regarding Manas as the internal Organ of perception(antarindriya) through which we directly know, for instance, Pleasure and pain and other mental states.  
  
The material character of mind receives clear emphasis is the Smkhya school, which considers it as a n evolute of Ahankara, which is ultimately derived from parkriti from which again the phuysical world itslef evolves.  
As such, manas belongs to the physical order of beings, and is shrply contrasted with atman and purusha(i.e. self) whose essential attribut is consciousness.  
  
According to vedanta Manas is not an independent reality. It is one of the many aspects or functions of antahkarna, which is generic term that would correspond to mind.  
  
Secondly, according to vedanta manas is not a indriya or sense organ.  
  
Thirdly, it is not regarded as an invisible, infinitesimal subsatnce( as in the Nyaya System), but is considered to be finit dimension.  
  
Antahkarna has has four different aspect or functions 1 manas 2 buddhi 3 ahnakara and 4 chitta Manas represents represents the indecisive state of anthakarna or mind as found for instance when we cannot ascertain whether an object is this or that. Buddhi stands for anthakarna in its state of assertion, as when we decisively know a thing as "this". Ahankara is the sate of anthakarna having some reference to the self, as in judgement" I am Happy" Chitta is antahkarna in its sate of remembering i.e referring to a past event.  
  
Authors of Panchadashi and vedanta sara distinguishes between the two functions of Anthakarna, namely Mans and budhi (amhankara is subsumed under manas and chitta under budhi) an its thought by subsequent writers ( vedanta Paribhasha and Asubhodhini Chapter 1) In his opinion Chitta is included in Manas, and ahankara in buddhi. The author of Vedanta-Sara also supports this two fold division, but according to him ahamkara is subsumed under mans and chitta under buddhi.  
  
It appears all Vedantins are unanimous and positive as regards to the meanings and functions of manas and buddhi But opinions differ as to the exact meanings of Chitta and Ahankara and their relation to their two functions.  
  
According to vedanta i.e advaita vedanta The self or atman is the only independent reality;the materiel, the physical or the objective are but creations of agyana, i.e ignorance or nescience. Anthakarana is product of of the begin-less nescience, through a confused identification with which the self gets individuated.  
  
Sorry for the long reply
