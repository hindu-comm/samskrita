Dear Vimalaji,



Thanks for the response.

I discern a marked difference in the scope of the word *citta* in Yoga Sūtra-s (YS) compared to Advaita or other schools. As it has been pointed out by Eddieji the entire YS is centered around—understanding and controlling—*citta* starting with योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः। \[yogaścittavṛttinirodhaḥ\] YS 1.2.



I tried the mp3 links you provided, but unfortunately they have been removed.



\[a personal note. I know that you believe in prayers, and I hope that you also believe in petitionary prayers since I join many others in praying for the good health of a precious member of this forum. Hope you are recovering well\].



Bala
