R. Balasubramanian,  
  
==>  

Are there other tighter definitions in other schools of Indian  
philosophy?  

==>  
  
The darśana indeed have a tighter definition. An exact definition in  
fact.  
Not only in Sanskrit, but exactly the same equivalent meaning in  
English.  
  
The exact equivalent is 'intellect' - see Webster's entry, below.  
  
Here we go then . . .  
  
  
'Manas' would be 'mind' as the anatomical organ, 'citta' the power of  
that organ.  
It must be realised that 'the seat of the mind' was often suspected to  
be located in the heart - in the chest, even up to Medieval times.  
  
  
In its purest form, it is also known to the poets as the light of a  
thousand suns.  
  
dṛś is equivalent to 'see', exactly so.  
Sanskritists, will know their dṛś, and can compare it with the English  
'intellect' as Webster's know it  
.  
If one were to regard the mysterious 'inner organ' as nothing more  
mysterious that the brain itself - the organ of the 'sixth sense'.  
We have in Sanskrit the meaning 'to see' not only with the organ of  
sight - the eye,but also 'to see' as with the inner organ, i.e. 'to  
understand'  
  
So the exact same usage in English viz. "Ah, I see!  
  
For further evidence, a quick count of the string 'citt' in the YS  
darśana, complete with Vyasa and Bhoja's commentaries gives '381'  
occurrences.  
should provide a revealing concordance for lexicigrophers.  
But that is not really necessary as we can let the Author himself,  
have the very last word on the subect - literally and figuratively:  
  
  
IV. 34 Puruṣārtha-sūnyānām guṇānām pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyam svarūpa-  
pratiṣṭhā vā citiśaktiḥ iti.  
  
  
Webster's  
  
intellect (inÆtl ektÅ), n.  
1. the power or faculty of the mind by which one knows or understands,  
as distinguished from that by which one feels and that by which one  
wills; the understanding; the faculty of thinking and acquiring  
knowledge.  
2. capacity for thinking and acquiring knowledge, esp. of a high or  
complex order; mental capacity.  
3. a particular mind or intelligence, esp. of a high order.  
4. a person possessing a great capacity for thought and knowledge.  
5. minds collectively, as of a number of persons or the persons  
themselves.  
\[1350–1400; ME \< L intell"ctus, equiv. to intelleg(ere) to understand  
+ -tus suffix of v. action; see INTELLIGENT\]  
—Syn.  
1. reason, sense, common sense, brains. See mind.  
  
  
The capital letters are Websters', not mine!  
And I doubt very much that 'the Author' will be allowed to have that  
last word - not in this group!
