Dear Balsubramanian,  
  
Do you want a definition of (अन्तःकरण), (बुद्धि), (मनस्) and चित्त) from the view point of advaita ( I mean the Shankara advaita) perspective then a good place to start would be to read Vedanta Paribahsah written by Dharmarajadhwarindar. Several editions of this book are available at [archive.org](http://archive.org)  
  
If you want a broader definition of these terms in terms of different Indian schools of philosophy you can read Indian psychology by Jadu Nath Sinha. The third volume of this book covers epistemology. The first volume of this book is available at DLI.  
  
Different schools within vedanta offer slightly different defenition for these terms.  
I can give these definitions but that would make the discussion too technical. I donot know if a highly technical discussion on these words are within the scope of this thread. Our members can decide  
  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
