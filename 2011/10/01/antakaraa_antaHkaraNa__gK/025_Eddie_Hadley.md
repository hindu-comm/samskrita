#### Ajit,

#### [ Classical Samkhya and Yoga](http://www.scribd.com/doc/54548856/Classical-Samkhya-and-Yoga) by Ian Whicher is another good book

A hard copy already sits upon my bookshelf. ![Open-mouthed smile](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/9a64fbb711202202/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile%5B1%5D.png?part=0.1)  

***Atha*** (temporal adverb), I’ll focus my inner organ in the direction of the others and exercise a bit of ***vitarka*** on them.



Thanks!
