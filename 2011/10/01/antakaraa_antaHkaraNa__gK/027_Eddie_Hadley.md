Ajit,



 I’ve looked into your suggestions.



 This is not the real title.

**** [**Classical Samkhya and Yoga**](http://www.scribd.com/doc/54548856/Classical-Samkhya-and-Yoga) **by Ian Whicher is another good book**



 The actual title is:

*** "The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A reconsideration of Classical Yoga***"

 Which is what I have on my bookshelf.



Details can be found from Amazon:

As to the others . . .



 Can you be more specific with their locations, please.

 I’ve only managed to hit one for download and even that is a restricted download.





Eddie

Are there other tighter definitions in other schools of Indian philosophy?
