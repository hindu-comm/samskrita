Dear Balasubramanian,  
  
S.S.S. Sastri’s translation is slightly old and uses several terms of western philosophical system (many of the terms he uses may need one more commentary to understand). If I May suggest you can read Perceiving in Advaita Vedanta by Bina Gupta which is a better and a scholarly translation and interpretation based on Paribhas Prakashika of Anantakrishna Sastri. However the book only talks about the first chapter of Vedanta Paribhasa. ( This book is available with Motilal Banarsidass Publishers [www.mlbd.com](http://www.mlbd.com))  
  
Please visit digital library of India site and use DLI down loader to download S S S Sastris Translation.  
If I may suggest reading a translation without reading the orginal may not help as translators often use western Philosohical words which may not exactly have the same meaning in Indian Philosophical context especially when one is reading a difficult text such as Paribhasha. I feel the text should be read with Maniprabha and Shikhamani commentary available at digital library of India site.  
  
Paribhas Prakashika of Anantakrishna Sastri on Vedanta Paribhasha is the best and most comprehensive commentary on the text.  
  
The words you have asked, as you know are untranslatable a solid grounding in Indian philosophical school may be required to undestand the full depth and implications of these terms.  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
