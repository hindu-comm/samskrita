Daksha,



 Thank you. But not quite what I was looking for.



 I am seeking specific information regarding **experience** within the context of the ***Darśana***, and is directed to anyone who has first hand experience of ***Saṃyāma***.

 A successful experience with ***Saṃyāma***.



You see, I view the ***Darśana*** as a development in the effectiveness the procedures, as from the ritual to the technical.



Development in the evolutional sense, that is, ***pariṇāma***, as confined to sphere (of influence or activity), the ***viṣaya*** of the ***Patañjali-sūtra***.

The old scribes had glorious ways with words, and can usefully illustrate the dry prose of an instruction manual, but they can't replace it.





As to references, you give a modern work, suitable for them man in the street to Doctors of Philosophy (it is written by one).



**The integrity of the Yoga Darśana** by Ian Whicher, 1998, traces in great detail, the changing meaning of the words throughout the history of the ***Saṃskṛta*** literature. Although he is yet another who simply regards the YS as a work of philosophy.



Appraising the Yoga Darśana as Technical manual is much more very revealing.



Humanity has evolved the species 'Guru' into species 'Expert'.
