hi  
In psychology mind is considered both as a subject and Object. In awareness the mind is said to become it own object. In Vedanta system, the difference between mind as the subject and and mind as a object is conceived to be a fundamental difference in quality, and to be too great to justify the use of common appellation for both. Consequently the two are regarded as two distinct entities an not two aspects or functions of the one entity, mind. Mind as subject is the self---- Atman--- and the mind as abject is the Mans or antahkarna ( it is to be remembered, however, the mans is a product of nescience, and therefore, only an apparent substance, that is illusory).  
  
The principle of this distinction, however, has come to be recognized in Western Philosophy by Idealists as well as by some realists.  
  
To elaborate further with a complete and detailed comparison may not be within the scope of this thread.  
  
I have talked buddhi, Mnas chitta and anthakarna only from the prama perspective ( determinate perception) there are also indeterminate perception and illusionary perception.  
  
Vedanta tries to develop the concepts of anthakarna. Mana buddhi, chta and ahankara from not only the waking sate but also perception in dream sate, depp sleep sate and in sates of illusion.
