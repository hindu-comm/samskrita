Dear Bala Mahodaya

Sankara explains these terms in his bhASya on KaThopaniSad, the third valli, where some these terms are applied to the chariot model of the self. You can follow this from Swami Paramarthananda’s talks, which are available for downloading. He follows Sankara closely and explains him well. AhamkAra is definitely a sAmkhya term and is the first component of individual selfhood which evolves from the unmanifested (avyakta) prakRti; buddhi is the discriminating mind or intellect and manas is used for the mind but in yoga the term citta appears.

I myself have researched these terms from the point of view of – sAMkhya -Yoga, Advaita and early Buddhist philosophy on skandhas (aggregates), as part of a book which I am proof reading at the moment and hope to publish as an e-book.
