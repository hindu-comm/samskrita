Here are some references that may be helpful with the intricate  
semantics on Antahkaran. The information is spread thru-out the  
books. These are by far the detailed discussions in a layman's  
language.  
  
Bhagwan Shri Ramana - Q and A's  
<http://www.beasyouare.info/beasyouare.html>  
  
from a Gujarati translation - please search for the relavant terms as  
the discussion is spread out in various volumes during Q and A's.

<http://download.dadabhagwan.org/books/English/PDF/aptavani-02.pdf>  
<http://download.dadabhagwan.org/books/English/PDF/aptavani-05.pdf>  
<http://download.dadabhagwan.org/books/English/PDF/aptavani-06.pdf>  
  
There are altogether 14 Aptavanis are in Gujarati awaiting translation  
where intricate details of pragna versus Buddhi; Agna versus  
Buddhi,Agna versus pragna are discussed in greater details.  
  
May you find these references helpful. These refs are very generic  
in language and devoid of any Sanskrit scriptural citations. Since  
this group is mainly focused on Samskrita, this post can be deleted by  
the moderator if it does not meet the criteria of this group.
