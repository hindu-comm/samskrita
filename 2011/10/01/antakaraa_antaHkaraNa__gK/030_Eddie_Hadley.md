Vimala,



==>

This link is a book by Mickel Burley – but it looks good and here are others in the series of interest too.

==>



 Classical Sāṃkhya And Yoga: An Indian Metaphysics Of Experience Mikel Burley.



 Yes, it’s looks interesting, but from glancing through it, it is just another cross tabulation those old terms.

An impressive title and an impressive price – available in its hardcopy incarnation for £85!



However, Eddie is not impressed.

It is clear that the ‘Experience’ in question is of the rhetorical kind, as from an inhabitant of the uni dimensional ivory towers.



Evolved beings, are inhabitants of the four dimensional antaḥkaraṇa!



I am seeking specific information regarding **experience** within the context of the ***Darśana***, and is directed to anyone who has first hand experience of ***Saṃyāma***.

A successful experience with ***Saṃyāma***.



Experience of the ***nirvitarkā*** state of being of the ***maṇi***.



I. 43 Smṛti-pariśuddhau svarūpa-śūnya-iva-arthamātra-nirbhāsā nirvitarkā.
