Loosey-goosey is putting it mildly.

 When I began my translation of Yoga-Vasishtha (The Freedom Method), three or four decades ago), \_citta_was a big problem, because it was almost always translated "mind"; and the associated *samAsa* compound (in the first *\_yoga-sUtra\_). was translated as mind-stuff.*

 On the other hand, \_manas\_ "mind" was something different than citta. In \_viveka-cUDAminI\_ and Shankara's note to the Mandukya Upanishad, we have a quaternity: Manas Mind, Buddhi Intellect, Chitta Loosey-goosey, and Aham-kaara I-dentity. Shankara said that these four terms were not like the four legs of a cow, but like the four quarters of a silver dollar. After some thought, I figured that one out.

 In logic, Manas would be called a self-containing Class.

 That means that the Class *manas* contains the Members {*manas, buddhi, cittam, ahaMkAra*}, just as the Class *apple is {apple, red, crisp, ....}* where the three ... dotsindicate other notions about apples.I call Manas "the Mind" (with a Capital Letter). It is the collective interplay of Buddhi Intellect, Ahamkaara I-dentity (Egoity), and the Loosey-goosey Chitta.

 My first serious yoga study was the Prabhavananda/Isherwood translation of Viveka-chudamani (The Crest-Jewel of Liberation). There I found the term "affective" applied to chitta. I've come to speak-of *citta*as "Affective mind" (small 'm')..

 When your I-dentity grasps an apple, it analyzes through the senses everything you want to know about the apple, and presents its data to the Loosey-goosey Chitta, the Affective mind, for its Affection. ("Affection" here includes every quality that relates to your I-dentity. If you like apples, you might say you had an affection for them. On the other hand, if you dislike apples (having, like me, few teeth), you might be said to be disaffected by them.

 It is the interplay of the three that gets you into trouble.

 My ongoing translation, Yoga-Vasishtha:*The Freedom Method, or, Vasishtha's Yoga-Treasury*, can be freely downloaded at

the yoga-vasishtha googlegroup, where there are many resources for the student of Sanskrit, and the *mumukSu* Freedom-seeker.
