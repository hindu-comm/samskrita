Thank you Bala-Ji

I have replied off-line to your kind thoughts and prayers re my health.
Yes I do believe prayers sustain one emotionally, and it was the evocative sound of Vedic chants which first attracted me to Sanskrit.



Interestingly the yoga philosophy and method first appears in KaTHa where citta is not used for mind. It appears later after the Yoga method was systematised by Patanjali. I will send you seapartely an extract from my book on the chariot model in KaU, as it may not be of general interest.



Vimala
