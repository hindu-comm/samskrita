Bala,



For the intellect . . .



**Indian ideas of the mind**, pp 449-453. in **The Oxford Companion To The Mind**\*

has this to say about the 'antahkarana', against the ' unbroken (Indian) cultural tradition of some 3,000 years of history':





The article is introduced with "One of the main topics of conceptual interest has been in philosophical psychology:

how the mind is to be analysed, trained, and developed, in order to to explain and obtain the religious goal of enlightenment and release from rebirth."

and it goes on to say:

". . . the term 'antahkarana', literally inner activity or inner organ, is used to refer collectively to a variety of perceptual, intentional, and cognitive, functions or agencies.

Often some or all of these terms are to be regarded as synonymous, in particular systems they can also be taken to refer to different things."

But, since those days, we now, in the

**The Age of Enlightenment** (also called The Age of Reason)\* of have had discoveries made by that self same 'antahkarana' to help us,

not only to explain, but also to obtain - literally, the 'religious goal' of enlightenment and release from 'rebirth' - literally.

To understand the natural world and humankind's place in it solely on the basis of reason and without turning to religious belief was the goal of the wide-ranging intellectual movement called the Enlightenment.

The movement claimed the allegiance of a majority of thinkers during the 17th and 18th centuries, a period that Thomas Paine called the Age of Reason.

At its heart it became a conflict between religion and the inquiring mind that wanted to know and understand through reason based on evidence and proof.
