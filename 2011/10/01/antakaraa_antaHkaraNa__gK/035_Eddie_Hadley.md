Yes, thank you Ajit.

The gainful employment of the antaḥkaraṇa in making a little ***Saṃyāma,*** is beyond book-learning.



Like most people here, I have long learned that the most reliable source of information, is obviously the source itself. Data tends to get corrupted, or important data can be omitted, otherwise.



A mind by any other name is still a mind.

Its nature indeed remains a mystery, the struggle to understand it is manifest in the lexicons, old or new.



Whatever its nature. All have the experience of it. Its function, being transparent to all, even unto the bookless.



To mind. To care for. To look after. To see to the welfare of. Of that of Its owner and its offspring.

To see, not only that no harm befalls it, but also that no opportunities escape it.



And what’s more, it does all this, all by itself, right out of the box!



The brain, the house of the mind, has been around a lot longer than any of its occupants. Its been around at least 100,000 years. And in earlier form, millions more.

Evidently, its good at what it does.



In the books, I have. Mind is a four letter word. A word, which the book explains. In a whole sentence full of even bigger words. And in case the big words are unfamiliar, they too have their words. Some such words are actually books in their own right. There are even books about books. Libraries full of of them.

Such is the nature of words.



Words are dependent on experience – for which an inner organ is as essential as ever, in discerning the harmful from the helpful, the genuine from the counterfeit.



Words relating inner organ experience of ***Saṃyāma.***

The technique of the development of the inner organ by the inner organ for the benefit of the inner organ.



The Jewel in the crown.



Eddie
