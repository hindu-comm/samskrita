Ajit, my friend,



Yes, but, am seeking specific information regarding **experience** within the context of the ***Darśana***, and am directing to anyone who has first hand experience of ***Saṃyāma***.

A successful experience with ***Saṃyāma***.



For example, take ***Saṃyāma # 3***, which is:

**III. 19 Pratyayasya para-citta-jñānam.**

Many indeed, are the para-citta, and Saṃyāma requires a suitable ***bīja.***

But, on a convenient ***bīja,*** I do obtain some ***jñānam***, though the fruits are ambiguous.



I haven't been able to find the exact Saṃskṛta equivalent, but the word that comes to mind in English is; ***garbled***.

******garble ******

–v.t.

 1. to confuse unintentionally or ignorantly; jumble: to garble instructions.

 2. to make unfair or misleading selections from or arrangement of (fact, statements, writings, etc.); distort: to garble a quotation.



Anyone resolve the ambiguity?

My view favours the ‘intentionally to garble instructions’.

But it could be both?

As to the cause, well, like the man said; **na ca tat sālambanaṃ**.

Eddie,

Eddie,  
  
As for the others, the usual: ‘No match found’.

Even the scan numbers don’t scan when doing a ‘find on page.  
  
  
I have downloaded from the site so please recheck all the books I have mentioned are accessible from DLI. When using DLI down loader you can use IUCCA site if it is not available from IISC site.  
Put in Indian Psychology in the title column and press enter you can see those books.  
Put in Jwala Prasad and Kuppuswamy in author column and you can see the books  
  
  
But for the remainder, please address your request to the rightful Copyright owners:  
  
Thank you you are very helpful  
In the meantime I have placed my order from an online book seller  
  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
