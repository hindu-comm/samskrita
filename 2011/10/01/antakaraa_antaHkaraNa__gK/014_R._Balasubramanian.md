Thanks for the explanation.



In your example, once *citta* has collected data about the apple—I may not resonate with you here—what happens? If *citta* were to perform any “analysis in decision-making”, would it not be usurping the role of the *manas*? Also, how does it interact with *buddhi*?



In my understanding, *citta* is passive and provides the substrate for the other three to interact. Another view would be that *citta* is just a theater and a storehouse, meaning it has no active contribution to the functioning of the “mind”? *Buddhi* is the ultimate puppeteer controlling the other three.
