Ajit,



 Pursuit of the Atman is not over, it is very much on-going. It is also, by its very definition, only to be experienced within, and must be sought.



An explanation by śaṃkarācārya, the teacher of the Vedānta philosophy has indeed been proffered, albeit in terms of the knowledge-base and vocabulary of AD 800, give or take a century or three.



Even up to the present, the search for the ‘seat of consciousness’, to use todays vernacular, has not proved all that conclusive. After that colossal effort to map the human DNA, international resources are now devoted to the resolving the ‘hard-soft’ problem of the mind.

Is the ‘soul’ and entity or an attribute? Is it matter (mind-stuff) or is it energy (an invisible ‘force’)?



So far, they have never actually been detected in isolation of each other. Whenever the One is detected, it has always been in close association to a material container.

Energy needs to be beamed and aimed and focused by a material container/reflector.

Even mental energy of the Universal variety.



Cleary, though, not everyone accepts that the search for the Knowledge ended, all those years ago.

Not so much its existence - the experience of that state is not uncommon – but its exact nature, is yet to be determined.



That end, is best served, by the trained, sharply focused, one-pointedly so, ‘mind stuff’. Pointed at the Target.

The soft-focus option, has its uses for the blurring of the field, as for cosmetic purposes.

Professors will testify to the effectiveness of both, point of focus, and direction.



Knowledge is accumulative, it has by its nature, a built in obsolescence.

The search continues, and needs all the help it can get from the venerable research treaties of old.



From that in view before the eyes, in the present, the mind-stuff gets to factually know (pramāṇa), past and the future.

 • a means of acquiring *Pramā* or certain knowledge (6 in the *Vedānta*, viz. *pratyakṣa*, perception by the senses; *anumāna*, inference. . . .  

And only by that means. It is the way of the enlightened ones. The eternal ‘mind-stuff’ is the teacher, even of the ancients, as Patañjali the instructor, instructs us all - when cleansed of layer upon layer of the cosmetic applications of vyāsas.



For this, a most daunting task, the mind-power of specialists in the ways of the researchers of old, must be harnessed, focused as by the lens of the saṃ-yāma.



Eddie
