According to Vedanta there there are three types of truths  
1 Vyvahara Satya  
2 Parmarthka Satya  
3 *prAtibhAsika satya*  
  
For according to to vednata the truth is the fourth sate not the waking, dream, deep dream states.  
  
For according to vedanta Atman is nothing to be pursued it is self evident (svath siddha) . The pramanas operate at vyavahra satya and not at Parmarthika satya.  
  
Sorry for this digression to explain beyond this is not within the scope of this thread. If you would like to raise a new thread we can discuss further.  
Sorry if you feel my explanations are short. Balasubramanyamji asked for defention of certain terms according to vedanta and i have answered that with my limited knowledge.  
  
  

Is the ‘soul’ and entity or an attribute? Is it matter (mind-stuff) or is it energy (an invisible ‘force’)?  
  

This is a different question and has nothing got to do with definitions that were asked  
  
I am sorry I cannot understand these sentences.

  
  

"The soft-focus option, has its uses for the blurring of the field, as for cosmetic purposes."  
  

"Professors will testify to the effectiveness of both, point of focus, and direction." The eternal ‘mind-stuff’  

when cleansed of layer upon layer of the cosmetic applications of vyāsas."  
  

"After that colossal effort to map the human DNA, international resources are now devoted to the resolving the ‘hard-soft’ problem of the mind."  
  

"That end, is best served, by the trained, sharply focused, one-pointedly so, ‘mind stuff’. Pointed at the Target.

The soft-focus option, has its uses for the blurring of the field, as for cosmetic purposes.

Professors will testify to the effectiveness of both, point of focus, and direction."
