PraNamaaMi \|



The sound "**त्स**" appears quite frequently in the "Chitpavani Konkani" dialect spoken by the Chitpavan community in Southern Maharashtra (Kokan region), Goa and some parts of Karnataka .



E.g. 1. "**हे बरां त्से. चखोट कल्पना. वाक्यां शिकेवें अणि लक्षांत ठेव्वें बरीं.** " = This is good. A very good idea. It is easy to learn and remember sentences thus.

 2. "**तुज्झि ही नवि कल्पना अव्वल त्से**. " = This new idea of yours is wonderful !



Another variant of this sound, viz. "**थ्स**" (as in **थ्से** = **त्से**)is also found in some parts of Karnataka.



Thepronunciation of "**त्स**" issomewhat close to the pronunciationof "**च**" ( as in "**चालणे**" = to walk in Marathi (but not as in "**चित्र**" =picture )).
