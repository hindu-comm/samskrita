We also have a variant of "dsa" almost inching close to "dza" in thelugu:

  

examples include:

  
"dzalubu" meaning common cold, a common human ailment

"dzanthikalu" a spiral form of eatable made during festivals, especially dhasara or sankraanthi

"dzagadam" meaning a tussle or fight, may be verbal or physical

"dzaamu" meaning shift or phase of night, commonly referred phase being "vekuva dzaamu" for early morning

  

I think the Andhra state government has removed these two letters from the elementary school syllabus (some two decades ago) on a premise that more letters will make learning the "thelugu" language difficult (when compared to english, of course). And as such, the present generation can not distinguish between "cha" and "tca", and "ja" and "dza" while speaking, leave alone while writing"
