If you use the advanced search feature on Monier-Williamns online dictionaty under <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/> and enter "ts" as the Prefix, you get several words -  

  
1 त्सर्  
2 त्सरा  
3 त्सरु  
4 त्सरुमत्  
5 त्सरुमार्ग  
6 त्सरुक  
7 त्सार  
8 त्सारिन्  

9 त्सारुक  
  
The conjunct is common at beginning of words in Cantonese and Mandarin and is often pronounced as (च) by foreigners - e.g. Tsim Sha Tsui is pronounced as त्सिम् शा त्सुई by the locals and चिम् शा चुई by the foreigners in Hong Kong.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
