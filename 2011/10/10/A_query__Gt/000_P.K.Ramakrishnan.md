गामात्तसारां रघुरप्यवेक्ष्य

निष्क्रष्टुमर्थं चकमे कुबेरात् /

  

Raghuvamsa Canto 5 - Sloka 26

  

Mallinatha gives the meaning of

gaam as bhuumim.

  

While searching for the word gaa

I could not find any in Apte or

Monier Williams.  But only found ग्मा

gmaa meaning earth.  Does the

dvitiyaa ekavachanam of gmaa become

गां gaam.

  

Can someone through some light on this?
