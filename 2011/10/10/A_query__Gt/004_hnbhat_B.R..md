Here is a verse with pun on the word "गो" resulting in उत्प्रेक्षा --  

  

विवस्वताऽनायिषतेव मिश्राः स्वगोसहस्रेण*समं जनानाम्*।

गावोऽपि नेत्रापरनामधेयास्तेनेदमान्ध्यं खलु नान्धकारैः॥

  

गावोऽपि विवस्वता कृतं स्वकिरणैः सह जनलोचनानां नयनमसदेव रात्रावान्ध्यं प्रति हेतुत्वेनोत्प्रेक्ष्यते।

  

This blindness is not due to the mass of darkness of night. But it looks as if the cows (गावः) known otherwise as eyes of the people were driven by the Sun mixed with his thousand cows (गोसहस्रेण - thousand rays). Because sights of people are also taken away by the Sun driving his own cows (rays). It is completely exaggerated cause by imagination for the blindness of the peole.
