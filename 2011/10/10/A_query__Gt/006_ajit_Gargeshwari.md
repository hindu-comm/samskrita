the word is गो  
One of the meaning of गो is earth दुदोहो गाम सा यज्ञाय ( R. 1.26; etc ) according to Apte pg 671 volume 2 in the 3 part dictionary published in the year 1958.  
The meaning of the complete verse is  
With the words" so bet it" the Brahman being greatly pleased with him accepted accepted his unfailing promise; Raghu too finding the earth with her resources drained, intended to wrench money from Kubera."
