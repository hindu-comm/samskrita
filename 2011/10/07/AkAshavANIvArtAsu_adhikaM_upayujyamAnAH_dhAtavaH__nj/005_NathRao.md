I don't understand what the reference Pa1n2. 2-3 , 13 Ka1s3. means.

Also, it seems to me that there are two different things here: In  
modern Indian languages, when borrowing verbs from markedly different  
languages, the method is noun + "do" in borrowing language. For  
example, in Tamil people say "drive paNNu". Sometimes this occurs when  
perfectly good verbs exist in the native language, mostly when a  
modern contraption is involved.

The other is a new verb formation (मर गया in Hindi referred to in this  
thread) sometimes described as "completive", sometimes (often among  
Indologists) confused with perfective. Beginnings of this seem to  
occur already in old Tamil, late Prakrit/Apabhramsa.
