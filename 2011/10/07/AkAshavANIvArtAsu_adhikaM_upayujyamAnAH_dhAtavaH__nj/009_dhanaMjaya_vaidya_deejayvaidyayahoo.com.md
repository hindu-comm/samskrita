Interesting. Madhav Deshpande has an interesting essay on vernacular  
modes of Sanskrit with detailed examples from dhunDirAja shAstrI's  
book. (A 19th century book to teach saMskRta - riddled with marAThI  
forms, and secondarily hindI forms.)  
सैनिको गतप्राणः / सैनिको गतप्राणोऽभूत् । would have been adequate.  
Adding "जातः" is too weird.

My guess is that it is a marAThI-based (or gujarAtI-based) imposition  
on saMskRta, rather than a hindI-based error.  
In hindI, the the existential verb is entirely taken up by forms  
beginning with the "ह्" sound (है, होता, हुवा, होगा), which are  
etymologically related to the saMskRta भू. (Perhaps with the exception  
of है)  
In marAThI (and gujarAtI, maybe other languages) both of the saMskRta  
existence verbs, अस् and भू, contribute forms: but are obligatorily  
restricted as to the tense. Also, probably since the time of the  
Western prAkRta, forms of जन् are used for the perfect past sense of  
the existential verb.)  
In marAThI, आहे, होता, झाला ; in gujarAtI छे, हता, जन्या .

pANini's saMskRta too restricts the use of the forms of अस् to some  
tenses, it is obligatorily replaced by forms of भू in the other  
tenses; but भू per se has no restrictions. Thus the weaving together  
of these verbs into one may be a very ancient process. However,  
pANini's saMskRta does not weave जन् into this mix.

dhunDirAja shAstrI, interestingly, used जातः in such constructions  
showing an effect of his first language (marAThI) rather than his  
second language (hindI). {He used to live in vArANasI, and there are  
some hindI influences on his saMskRta. But fewer than the marAThI  
influences.}
