namaskaarams Shri Anooj,

Thanks for the question and the discovery that the English  
translations are too simplistic, incorrect or lacking the spiritual  
insight.

The mantras you have referred to are in the first manDala of Rig Veda,  
and are saura-sUkta-s. They, along with other mantras from Rig Veda,  
dedicated to sUrya (65 in total) form a "garland", which are  
traditionally recited by Rig vedins at the mAdhyahna-sandhya time.  
Some of them are recited in the praataH-sandhya as well.

  
==

In particular to your question, I have uploaded the Sayana Bhashya,  
which also has a a simple Hindi translation.  
<http://www-roc.inria.fr/~upadrast/Veda/Sayanas_Commentary_RV_1_50/>

The GIF files are also attached for record. Note: I extracted the  
sources from the following online location:  
<http://www.vedamu.org/>

  
If you can read sanskrit, the above sanskrit commentary there is \*the\*  
standard location to "understand" the meaning of these mantras in the  
traditional vedic centric way. The secret tip to do it, is of course  
to find a shrotriya rig-vedin (rig veda scholar) who can explain you  
the meaning, and perhaps teach you the same as well.

==  
If you are looking for modern interpretatiions, I could suggest the  
books of Shri Kapali Sastry.

I think one of the earlier books of His titled "Book of Lights" had a  
translation of these sUktas. I do not remember which one. An English  
translation of the commentary of Shri Kapali Sastry has been done by  
Prof. Shri. R.L. Kashyap, details of which you can find in their  
website:

Hope these help!  
namaste  
Ramakrishna
