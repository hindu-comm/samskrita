It's no use ordering by phone or email from where you are (unless you are in Ghaziabad or Chitrakuta) since the cost of the booklet is Indian Rupees 10 only (the publisher is a non-profit) and the cost of delivery would be much more.  
  
A scanned copy of the book is now available on the author's website from [this link](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/ViewContent/pdfs/Jagadguru%20Rambhadracharya%20-%20Sandhyopasana.pdf) (the link has also been added to the downloads page [here](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/downloads)). It is a scan and is around 16 MB in size. A PDF of the original typeset will be available soon, which would be less than 100 KB.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
