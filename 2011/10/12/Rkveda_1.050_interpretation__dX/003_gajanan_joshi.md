Very true, if you search on net you get these dry translations.

It’s a difference of Tatwadnyan and Aadhyatma.

When I searched translation of Ishavasya on net I was not happy about the translations. But I was lucky enough to get a book on Ishavasya. This was based on Param Pujya Shri Panduranga Shastri Aathavalejee’s pravachans. It was the best! Got similar enjoyment of reading like when I red Ramkrishana Vachanamrut.

In short we need a Sadguru to guide and explain Dharmashastra.



Please forgive me if I am wrong and also for my typos if any.
