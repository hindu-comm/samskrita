I would implore as well as encourage all of the learned elderly  
stalwarts to please kindly guide me in providing me a decent  
interpretation.   
  

I do not fall into the above category however,  
  
You can try reading them with Saynacharyas Bhashya (edited By max Muller or the one published by Sva Adhyaya mandal of Poona) or with Rigarthadipika of Maadhva edited by Lakshman Sarup. ( all are available on the web) If you feel the translations of Max Muller or Griffith are inadequate for you purposes  
Dayanand Sarswati has given his own commentary of Rig veda published in 10 to 12 volumes (parts of which are available at DLI site  
  
You can also read Aurobinod's views his complete works on Savitri, agni etc are vailable on their Website  
  
After reading you can make your translations interpretations and notes.  
  
thetranslation is way too dry and somewhat irrelevant as well as

  
erroneous as far as the vedic context is concerned, and is almost  
lacking any spiritual conveyance or any spiritual teachings of our  
maharṣis – making the whole śloka useless or sounding like a fairy  
tale.  

  
Hence you must read the standard bhashyas in sanskrit and decide
