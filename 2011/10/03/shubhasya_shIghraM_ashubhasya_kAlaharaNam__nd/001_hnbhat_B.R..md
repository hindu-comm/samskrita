Though in some web-pages I found it quoted with reference to Ravana and Rama in Ramayana (but without any reference to the text), the सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार compiled by Kashinatha Sharma with sources they could trace has listed this as a prose piece under सुभाषितरत्नखण्डानि and no trace of metric structure could be noticed in the सुभाषित. They do not assign any source for this.

  

Hope some member would come up with information on the source.
