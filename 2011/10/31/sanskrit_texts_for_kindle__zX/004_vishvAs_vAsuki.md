Thanks all - shrI-jayadIp's reply clarifies the problem a bit - mobi format downloads available for sanskrit books are not readable.  
  
PDF scans of sanskrit books and pdf unicode sanskrit books are readable - albeit one has to set it up to read it in landscape mode, and zooming / panning (if required) can be very distracting/ disorienting due to the slow refresh rate. Plus table of content/ searches don't work with scans.  
  
Thus far, I have mainly read sanskrit in ITRANS encoding (and it is easy to convert to it from unicode devanAgarI web-pages) on kindle (the bAlakANDa book linked earlier).  
  
I just came across other work by desirAju hanumantarAv at - <http://www.giirvaani.net/> - one can derive mobi books thence with a few commands.  
  
I have not figured out how to convert unicode pdf sanskrit books to mobi format (calibre messes up fonts, but maybe one can try [archive.org](http://archive.org) tricks).
