Dear all,

The Kindle can read pdf formats. I have uploaded all the 19 volumes of Complete works of Shankara all in pdf , available through net(some body had given a link in this group only earlier) on my kindle. I am able to read all books on the kindle without problem.

  

I have about 25 books in djvu . Can somebody suggest me the procedure to upload to Kindle wihthout converting to pdf.  



Warm regards
