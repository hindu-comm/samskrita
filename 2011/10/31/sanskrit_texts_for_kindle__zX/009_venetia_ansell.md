EPUB 3, a new eBook standard which has just been launched, supports for the first time non-Roman script content - ie: all Indian languages and scripts will be supported. As of now, Amazon is not using EPUB 3 and has in fact announced its own new format, Kindle Fire 8 (KF8), which may or may not support non-Roman scripts - we'll know more soon when they release the specs.

At the moment, your best option for reading Devanagari or any other Indian script on an eReading device is the iPad which supports various parts of the new EPUB 3 format, but not yet everything. As EPUB 3 has only just been released, device makers and software makers haven't yet caught up but they soon will and at that point most eReading devices, bar the Kindle, will support Devanagari etc.

In the past, it was possible to have non-Roman script in an eBook (rather than a pdf) but only by using images rather than text. That meant that you couldn't search the text, or copy/paste etc. With EPUB 3 all these things should I hope become possible with Devanagari as well as English.

There are some Indian eReaders, such as the Pi, which are meant to support Indian languages (but presumably only in pdf format)but I have not had a chance to try them out myself.
