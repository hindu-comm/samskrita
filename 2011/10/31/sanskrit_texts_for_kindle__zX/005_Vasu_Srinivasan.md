vishvas mahodaya  
  
thanks for sharing your experience with reading sanskrit in kindle. inability to read sanskritam books (without effort) is the main reason i havent gone for kindle..  
  
my brother got nook color and he rooted it with android 2.3 and has had success with reading djvu (djvu app for android is available i think) and pdf books (non unicode)
