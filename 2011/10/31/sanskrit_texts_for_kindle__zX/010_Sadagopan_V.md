 Sarangji,













To read a pdf file or a djvu file in Kindle:







"The source file in word, text or html formats is to be read into  
microsoft word, in unicode font preferably."  
  

If one has pdf files and DjVu files with English as well asSanskrit words in them, how does one read them into microsoft word in unicode font? Could you please let me know?
