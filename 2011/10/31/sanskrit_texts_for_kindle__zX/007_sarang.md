Kindle as of now does not support devanagari or other indic language  
(say tamil) fonts. I think, even if a file is converted to mobi,  
devanagari scripts will not be displayed.  
All normal pdf files are set for A4 page size, too big for kindle  
screen. Scrolling and zooming is not a convenient way to read.  
I have followed this procedure to read devanagari, tamil and bilingual  
files in kindle.  
The source file in word, text or html formats is to be read into  
microsoft word, in unicode font preferably. The page size is set to  
9cmx12 cm and all margins set to 0.4 cm. Font size can be set to easy  
reading in 9x12 page size. The word file can then be saved in pdf  
format and then transferred to kindle.  
I have converted gita and valmiki ramayan from (valmiki [ramayan.net](http://ramayan.net)).  
All this hassle can be avoided if amazon provides font support for  
samskrit
