i have found that I like reading books on kindle rather than on the computer, which requires files in mobi or amazon formats (pdf being cumbersome to read on the device). Unfortunately there aren't free-samskrita books readily available online (Eg: rAmAyaNa and mahAbhArata) - only their english translations (which are good, but I want sanskrit verse - preferably even bilingual texts).  
  
For rAmAyaNa, I found bilingual html text here - <http://www.valmikiramayan.net/>, whence I converted balakANDa (which I am currently reading) appropriately using the software calibre. This file is available [here](http://sanskritnlp.appspot.com/books/bala_kANDa.mobi). (I request people hosting sanskrit book collections to copy this ebook version and serve it on their websites - access to ebooks in mobi format is useful to kindle owneres, and I am not able to serve this file for a long time.)  
  
If you have such books (especially bilingual ones) in html or mobi formats, please let me know.
