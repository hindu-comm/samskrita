Thanks to Dr. Bhat and Sunder, for the valuable links.  
  
I was a little busy last and would not spend time on this; and it also took me sometime to identify the verse since the english translation was a little topsy turvey when it came to position of lines as compared to the original one.  
  

> namo astu sarpebhyaH :         Taittiriya Samhita 4.2.8;  

  
information about this mapping is not available elsewhere (in google searches) and I have been looking for meaning of this slokam for quite some time; now I got what i wanted.  
  
Thanks a lot for the help, folks.  
Regards,  
Samba
