Could someone please post an english translation for Sarpa Sooktham from Krishna Yajur Vedham?  
  
An English transliterated version can be found here:[Sarpa Sooktham](http://www.bharatiweb.com/English/Sarpa%20Sooktam%20Eng%20v1.pdf).  
  
I have have searching for this for so long but could not find one it till date;perhaps it may be in theEnglishtranslation of Krishna Yajur Vedham but could not locate this particular sooktham from that large book.  
  
Thanks and Regards,  
Samba
