What I have heard of शास्त्रार्थ is only that शास्त्रार्थ took place between 'A' and 'B' and 'A' was defeated..  
  
I think two of the replies are in line with what I wanted to know. My limited understanding is that शास्त्रार्थ was like modern day debate on some important topic of those days. Since Sanskrita saahitya has covered a very broad spectrum of subjects, I thought some or the other book might have dealt this very important issue too. I want to be pointed to these books or parts of the books. Those 'written' thinks may or may not have been followed in practice, is another thing.
