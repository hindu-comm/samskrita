Anunad,



 Do you mean the ākṣepasamādhāna parts of a śāstrārtha?



If I have guessed the question correctly, then there is no peer-review to provide a consensus.





The winner is the ā-gama, or author of the śāstrārtha.

He is the one that raises the argument – and answers it.



He is the judge and jury. He is infallible.



The Guru is always right.



But, as to what constitutes an ā-gama or a guru is often the subject of vigorous debate . . .

‘reason’ is probably not the right word . . .



 Eddie,
