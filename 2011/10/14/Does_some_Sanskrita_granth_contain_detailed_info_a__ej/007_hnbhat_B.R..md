I am sorry. I have got only hard copy and do not have a soft copy. The publication details are below:

  

Pariṣkāradarpaṇaḥ

  

by śuklaveṇīmādhavaśāstri, Rājanārāyaṇaśukla's commentary
śāstrārthakalā।

Haridāsasaṃskṛtagranthamālā No. 35,1935 caukhāmbāgranthaprakāśan, Varanasi.

  

May be available still now if reprinted. I had purchased long long ago. I may be able to get it scanned, but the pages are very old and I cannot be sure of the quality of the scanned pages, if scanned. It is a small book, the same print now 76 years old, but bad paper too. I can try, but cannot guaranty.

  

With regards
