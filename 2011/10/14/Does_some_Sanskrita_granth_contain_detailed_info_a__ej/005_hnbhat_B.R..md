Here is what is covered by शास्त्र -

  

सेयं शास्त्रोक्तिः \|  
प्रत्यधिकरणं च ऋचं यजुः सामाथर्वणां ब्राह्मणं चादाहृत्य भाषामुदाहरिष्यामः \|  
तत्र वर्णानां स्थानकरणप्रयत्नादिभिः निष्पत्तिनिर्णयिनी शिक्षा आपिशलीयादिका \|  
नानाशाखाधीतानां मन्त्राणां विनियोजकं सूत्रं कल्पः \|  
सा च यजुर्विद्या \|  
शब्दानामन्वाख्यानं व्याकरणम् \|  
निर्वचनं निरुक्तम् \|  
छन्दसां प्रतिपादियित्रीछन्दोविचितिः \|  
ग्रहगणितं ज्यौतिषम्, अलङ्कारव्याख्यानं तु पुरस्तात् \|  
पौरुषेयं तु पुराणम्, आन्वीक्षिकी, मीमांसा, स्मृतितन्त्रमिति चत्वारि शास्त्राणि \|  
तत्र वेदाख्यानोपनिबन्धनप्रायं पुराणमष्टादशधा \|  
यदाहुः- ऽसर्गः प्रतिसंहारः कल्पो मन्वन्तराणि वंशविधिः \|  
जगतो यत्र निबद्धं तद्विज्ञेयं पुराणमिति \|\|  

  

  

So the these are some of the शास्त्र-s.

  

  

यस्य नास्ति निजा प्रज्ञा केवलं तु बहुश्रुतः।

*न स जानाति शास्त्रार्थं*दर्वी सूपरसानिव।। 2-81-1॥ 

  

First one has to learn the शास्त्र-s, and then get training in the शास्त्र for deciding the शास्त्रार्थ by himself. Then only one can establish what he has learnt before any audience of learned scholars trained in each of their शास्त्र-s like him defending his views and refuting the others objections within the scope and jurisdiction of the शास्त्र concerned. This is the practice still continued and you can attend any of these शास्त्रार्थ debates in काञ्ची मठ every Thursday (commemorating गुरुवार-वाक्यार्थ-सभा) or probably view some of the audio clips some times shared here. Every year शास्त्रवाक्यार्थसभा is held for one week beginning from गणेशचतुर्थी in शृङेरी under the presided by the जगद्गुरु. This is the traditional शास्त्रार्थवाक्यार्थसभा as I have witnessed some. First one has to finish training under a teacher the normally covered range of literature under one or more than one शास्त्र. If you want to know what is शास्त्रार्थ in the traditional sense.

  

Otherwise, any translation wold give your the meaning of any work in any topic in any language you want. You can find debaters in the modern Conferences which is also a debate on different fields of literature. Even for न्यायशास्त्र there are many translations and commentaries.

  

Now if you want to know the history of such वाक्यार्थ even with their own गुरु can be seen in the history from the Vedic period also. याज्ञवल्क्य was the main debater on वेदान्त topics, and शतपथब्राह्मण is a course of debates on the topic of ब्रह्मन् held between his शिष्य the king जनक. जनक kept the bet of 1000 cows for those who can explain him what is ब्रह्म replying to his queries satisfactorily and none were able. But only याज्ञवल्क्य came and asked his students to drive the cowherd to his hermitage for their feeding and engaged in debate with जनक. This is the background of present शास्त्रार्थ. The judge should be well-versed in all the शास्त्र-s any participant can present his theories and should be able to pass judgement in case of doubt.

  

न्यायशास्त्र and व्याकरण are considered among the main tools for achieving perfection of the art of debate as provided traditionally:

  

काणादं पाणिनीयं च सर्वशास्त्रोपकारकम्।

  

Now you can learn these two, and see if the practice differs from your experience of these two शास्त्र-s whether the present present practice differs from the theories found in these two शास्त्र-s. मीमांसा and वेदान्त are two other favorite subjects. On any topic widely spread in these, one can debate but it should be acceptable to the fixed norms withing the framework of the शास्त्र.

  

There is one book परिष्कारदर्पण giving exemplars of certain sentences explained in detail. You have not yet mentioned what is your purpose of the query. If you have finished learning and training period in any शास्त्र, the book would be helpful. Otherwise, I don't think it will do any good.

  

Many earlier messages have written a lot on the subject. You can accept any of them and continue your research if your intention is for research purpose.

  

Sorry for the lengthy reply. There was another thread on this topic of शास्त्रार्थ but I could not find right now by search.
