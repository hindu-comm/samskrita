Anunad,



 **Scholastic Sanskrit - A manual for Students.**



The oral style of debate, elaborated on by our professor, is continued in the written works,

along with the set formula of the commentarial style, which must be understood if the reading of the bhāṣya are to prove fruitful.



Many have of us learn the hard way, that understanding the bhāṣya style of of Sanskrit prose, is a study in itself.



The five services of a commentator are given in a verse from the Parāśarapurāṇa, that is quoted without elaboration, in the Nyāyakośa:

 pada-cceddaḥ padārthoktir vigraho vākya-yojanā

 ākṣepeṣu samādhānaṁ vyākhyānaṁ pañca lakṣaṇam





That elaboration, quite readable, provided by a Harvard educated professor, along with many examples drawn from the comentaries of Mallinātha and

Śaṃkara's own Brahmasūtrabhāṣya,

by a 300 page volume, with the script entirely in diacritic Roman is available.



It is not very often that the publishers’ blurb can be fully relied on, but this one is deserving of a repeat:



“This volume gives a complete introduction to the techniques and procedures of Sanskrit commentaries, including detailed information on the overall structure of running commentaries, the standard formulas of analysis of complex grammatical forms, and the most important elements of commentarial style. Since the majority of expository texts in Sanskrit are composed in the form of commentaries on earlier texts, this Manual will be of great use to many Sanskrit translators. Furthermore, because many philosophical and scientific texts are written in the style of formal debate using the same basic principles, the features covered in the manual are useful for reading all expository texts, whether they are commentaries or not.”







Very recent, very readable and very comprehensive work on the Sūtra style has recently (2007) been published by Columbia University of New York.

It is not often I can say this regarding the general standard of publications on works of Sanskrit, but this is an exceptional work - highly recommended

Study of the classical commentaries on the **Darśana**, aided by the above work, is equally rewarding.



And it is not too expensive, and of particular value considering it is the product of years of practical teaching experience in the subject.
