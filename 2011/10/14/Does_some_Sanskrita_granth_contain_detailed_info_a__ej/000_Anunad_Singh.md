We hear a lot about shaastraartha (शास्त्रार्थ) between various aachaaryaas and thinkers of India. Is there some Sanskrita granth where details of shastraartha is given?  By 'DETAILS' I mean - how it was conducted, the rules for deciding correct reasoning procedure, the rules for deciding who wins etc.
