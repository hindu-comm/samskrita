Dr. Patel asked whether Mallinatha's Commentary referred to by you is available? Which one of the links contains Mallinatha's interpretation referred to you in the above post.

  

The question was precisely about the Mallainatha's interpretation, not about all the commentaries published on Malavikagnimitra. Hope you will understand the question and the precise information than expecting one to download all the files and look if they are containing Mallinatha/s commentary. It will be helpful for all.
