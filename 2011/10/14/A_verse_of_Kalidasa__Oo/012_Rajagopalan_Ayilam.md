There are two more verses of Kalidasa about knowledge. I giving it here with translations.  
  
  
यस्यागमः केवलजीविकायै  
तं ज्ञानपण्यं वणिजं वदन्ति।  
  
(मालविकाग्निमित्रम् : १ - १७) \[ The last two lines of the verse\]  
  
  
One whose learning only serves as a means of livelihood, is called a mere trader who uses agreessive/annoying methods to sell his products.  
  
आ परितोषाद्विदुषां न साधु मन्ये प्रयोगविज्ञानम् ।  
  
बलवदपि शिक्षितानामात्मन्यप्रत्ययं चेतः ॥  
  
(अभिज्ञान शाकुन्तलम् : १ - २)  
  
Until the wise are satisfied, I do not consider my knowledge, which I present, to be perfect. The mind of men although well instructed has no confidence in itself.  
  
  
**A.S.Rajagopalan**
