Act 1 Verse 16  
Translation: " A man can perform excellently in person, another posses to a remarkable degree the power of communicating his skill; he who posses both excellences, should be placed at the head of teachers."  
  
( The whole of the stanza is in the form of a general satement from which a meaning relating to the subject matter namely, the two rival teachers is understood. This is the case of अप्रस्तुताप्रश्मसा . It may be noted that Kalidasa is very fond of this figure os speech which occurs, not only in Sanskrit verses, but also in the prose passages in Sanskrit or Prakrit)  
  

  
See above Mallinatha,s interpretation
