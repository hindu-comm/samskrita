Dear friends,

  

I feel very much excited by your profound competence and quick answers.

I was seeking an answer to this more than a year.

  

This sign actually called Baluda in the Mongolian Unicode (<http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1800.pdf>). I have never seen any accounts of this sign in mongolian literature, it is only mentioned, nothing more.

  

Damaru sign also can be found in the Unicode document I provided the link above.

  

And there are also two symbols which are called UBADAMA and INVERTED UBADAMA respectively. I wonder if you can shed some light on these two also.

  

And please point to a source with the thorough account of all these symbols in the script and languages which use them (I am looking mostly for Sanskrit, but any other additional sources of information are good).

  

Thank you so much!

  

Om mani padme hum!

  

Tsebeen
