Tsebeen,  
  
I know neither Tibetan nor Mongolian. The following only traces the  
trail I followed, using the Internet and the omniscient Google!  
  
The site you have mentioned above (<http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/>  
U1800.pdf) also has, a few lines above 'MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI GALI  
BALUDA' another entry 'MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI GALI DAMARU' and a picture  
of that letter. The picture resembles Shiva's Damaru and, I would  
say, got its name from the Indian percussion instrument called  
'Damaru'. Below it is the remark 'tibetan sign ise tse can'.  
  
Bigger pictures of these two, Mongolian and Tibetan signs  
respectively, may be seen at <http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1882/index.htm>  
and <http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0f88/index.htm>  
  
This latter webpage also has the remark 'See Also kannada sign  
jihvamuliya U+0CF1 mongolian letter ali gali damaru U+1882'.  
  
I am also not a Vedic scholar but remember that in January 2011, there  
was some discussion here about the Vedic sign 'ardhavisarga' when our  
learned members Dr H.N.Bhat and Naresh Keerthi had brought up  
'jihvamuliya'. It would thus appear that above mentined Mangolian and  
Tibetan signs resembling the Damaru have something to do to represent  
the Vedic pronunciation called 'jihvamuliya'.  
  
The vedic 'jihvamuliya', I think, has almost disappeared from common  
knowledge. So would be the case with Mongolian Damaru too.  
  
I am sure Dr H.N.Bhat and Naresh Keerthi can shed more light on  
'jihvamuliya' and from that, on Mongolian Damaru.
