As per the above Whitney's Grammar page relating to the vowels, a protracted vowel as he calls it properly called in Sanskrit Grammar, as प्लुत which is used mostly in writing Vedic language:

  

> Besides these two vowel-quantities, the Hindus acknowledge a third, > called pluta (literally swimming), or protracted, and having three > moras or three times the quantity of a short vowel. A protracted vowel > is marked by a following figure 3: thus, आ३ā3.

  

In Sanskrit Grammar books, it is called त्रिमात्र स्वर. as directly stated by Panini in the rule :  
  

1-2-27 ऊकालोऽज्झ्रस्वदीर्घप्लुतः ।

  

*उश्च ऊश्च*ऊ३श्च वः; वां कालो यस्य सोऽच् क्रमाद् ह्रस्वदीर्घप्लुतसंज्ञः स्यात्

  

1-2-27 ūkālo'jjhrasvadīrghaplutaḥ \|

  

uśca ūśca ū3ś ca vaḥ; vāṁ kālo yasya so'c kramād hrasvadīrghaplutasaṁjñaḥ syāt

  

The code No.1886 and d1886 correspond to Mongolian ALI GALI - BALUDA - Tibetan : paluta

andALI GALI - three BALUDA

  

are the same *pluta*sign represented with the ३ after the vowel to indicate the three times length of the vowel which precedes it. As it can be noticed in Whitney's notes, in the page, one can see that it is proficiently used in Vedic passages and rarely in classical sentence. Panini has prescribed the triple length vowel in two rules: one Vedic usage:

  

प्रत्यभिवादेअशूद्रे॥८।२।८३,दूराद्धूते च॥८।२।८४,हैहेप्रयोगे हैहयोः॥८।२।८५,गुरोरनृतोऽनन्त्यस्याप्येकैकस्य प्राचाम्॥८।२।८६,ओमभ्यादाने॥८।२।८७ up to the end of the section 8.2.  

  

अभिवादये देवदत्तो ऽहम्, भो आयुष्मानेधि देवदत्त३।

abhivādaye devadatto 'ham, bho āyuṣmānedhi devadatta3\|

  

अग्निचि३त्

agnici3t

  

This is the use of the ३ sign, corresponding to the baluda (Mongolian - or Gali) or paluta (Tibetan) called in Sanskrit प्लुत simple phonetic changes when borrowed by epenthesis insertion of "a" along with other phonetic changes as common in Prakrit dialects. This much is for the correspondence of the signs and their names in the three scripts and its use in Sanskrit texts. In other languages, those who know the use of in other scripts the language in which they are used should be able to relate with the function of it in the written text or grammar. Buddhist texts do not contain anyhow Vedic passages as they do not accept Vedic injunctions and the use of this sign is to be attested by their employment in the texts written using the script for which it was invented.

  

And for Damaru, there is no such correspondence in Sanskrit terminology in Grammar. But by symbol as it appears in the chart No.1882 preceded by "visarga" aspirate "h" which is 8 looking like our Devanagari visarga symbol and this Damaru is like the "अर्धविसर्ग" as it is called in some other thread and inverted = rotated "अर्धविसर्ग " symbols used for जिह्वामूलीय and उपाध्मानीय as Sriramanan had demonstrated in the other thread. Both can be seen in this link:

  

<http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3861.pdf>

  

Here is the relevant symbols used in Vedic texts:

The symbols resemble one or other these, whether inverted umbda damaru or visarga proper. This is for the graphic resemblance.

  

For their phonetic variations, "visarga" is particular to Sanskrit aspirate "h" which when followed by "p and ph" is called उपाध्मानीय (upādhmānīya) and जिह्वामूलीय (jihvāmūlīya) before the consonant group "k and kh". This is according to Sanskrit Grammar. The symbols can be compared with the Mongolian Chart characters 1881-1884 with the variations presented in the second set of the images here:

This much is what I can gather and explain with Grammar. The rest can be compared from both the unicode pdf files.

  

Here are more Vedic symbols for comparison:

I don't think all would have been used in Gali script for writing Buddhist texts.
