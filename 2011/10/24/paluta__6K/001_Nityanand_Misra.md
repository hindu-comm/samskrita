In Tibetan script, paluta is the transliteration of the devnagari avagraha, which is the representation of akaaraprashlesha (a coalesced vowel) as you see in so'ham. Might be the same in galig.

Not sure about damaru though. Can you share some examples with IAST or IPA notation? It might be easier to determine what the symbols stand for.
