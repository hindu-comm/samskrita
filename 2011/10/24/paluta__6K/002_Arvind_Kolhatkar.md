Tsebeen,  
  
Some information about the system of transcription called Galig,  
created in the 16th century to transcribe Sanskrit/Tibetan works into  
Mongolian, may be seen in the preview of 'The Mongolic languages' by  
Juha Janhunen in [books.google.com](http://books.google.com) at <http://tinyurl.com/3bs2ck3>.  
  
I could not locate what you call as Mongolian 'paluta' in it or  
elsewhere but I could locate the Tibetan mark 'paluta' at  
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Po/list.htm>. The  
Tibetan mark 'paluta', the picture of which you can see on this  
webpage, is meant to transcribe the Sanskrit 'avagraha' or the mark  
'ऽ' that represents the unspoken but underlying vowel 'अ' in Sanskrit  
sandhis as, for example, in सोऽहम् = स: अहम्.  
  
Since the Mongolian and Tibetan branches of Buddhism are close allies,  
is it possible that the Tibetan mark 'paluta' is the same as the  
Mongolian mark 'paluta'?  
  
I could not see any connection between 'paluta' and 'damaru'. The  
latter, as far as India is concerned, is the small hour-glass like  
drum in the hand of Lord Shiva, who plays it in his cosmic dance. You  
can see images of it if you search for it through Google-Images.
