Namaste!  
  
I am a buryad-mongol from Ulaan Ude near Baikal lake. Mongols had  
developed a transcription scheme for Sanskrit as long as 500 years ago  
in 1587 widely known as Galig. This transcription includes also  
symbols for paluta, damaru, etc. Please if you have any idea what  
these symbols might denote let me know. Thank you!  
  
I tried to ask Russian Sanskrit community but it seems that know one  
no'z the matter.  
  
Om svasti.
