Ajit,



“Let me give a Sanskrit sentence त्वं किम करोषि ?”  

To answer you question.



You begin with actual material from the real world. Your example does not make sense.



You put the pronoun as the first word, which suggests the vocative, except that the inflection is not in the vocative case.

‘You! what are you doing? Vocative plus interrogative



Are you trying to say ‘What are you doing?’ Interrogative

For that, you would drop the pronoun.



Then, there is no such word as ‘kima’. Is it a typo for किम्



Kṛ is a advanced verb, not for beginners.





In short:

> 
> > You take real world material. >
> 
> > 
> > You start with an experienced tutor, human or otherwise. >
> 
> > 
> > And you do the exercises. >
> 
> > 
> > Submit the homework for review. >
> 

 An experienced tutor will frame his tutoring according to the natural ability his the pupil.

 But that natural ability, needs to be there in the first place.

 And, as the man says. “If you have to ask, you’ll never know”\*.
