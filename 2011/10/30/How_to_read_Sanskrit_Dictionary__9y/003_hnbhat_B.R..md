I think Eddie has already specific in his reply and needs no more specification.  
  
I am just clarifying some points in your queries:

One has to read it as per the Instructions given to read it as any one using it as a Dictionary meant for the specific language. It cannot be compared with the other languages' Dictinary strictly.

  
  

> 2 How does one know the meaning of a given word ( Dictionaries give

The purpose of a Dictionary is different from that of a Grammar. Dictionaries are not meant for teaching Language, but only to give a knowledge of the words used in any language. The system of presentation may differ and the grammar will certainly differ for each language. It may not be the same as for Chinese English Dictinary, as Sanskrit English Dictionary or Arabic English Dictionary.   
So Grammar has to be learnt from a Grammar Book and vocabulary should be increased by reading the texts in the language Sanskrit to widen the knowledge acquired from the Grammar Texts. Once you get the outline of the language set up of any language, you can use the Dictionary specifically designed for it and not otherwise learn language and grammar with the Dictionary.

It is due to many reasons. First, they expect you to look for the meaning the Dictionaries, of the words you identify in the language, Sanskrit by learning Grammar. This is so because, Sanskrit is an highly inflectional language like any classical Indo European Language.
Secondly English Language is a spoken language and many words are easily recognized by exposure to the language than anything and only in the case of rare words one has to refer to a Dictionary after one has acquired the language. Thirdly, comparatively English has less inflected forms than Sanskrit Language and it would consume considerably large space in printing, without much to gain to understand the meaning. This was the opinion of BoaroH who had compiled an exhaustive Dictionary for Sanskrit as discussed in another thread.

This gist is the compiler of Sanskrit English Dictionaries expected the user to have a knowledge of the language enough to identify the stem through Grammar. This is the obvious reason why all the inflected forms are given. Even then, sample inflected forms are given in Monier William's Dictionary for irregular forms of words nominal stems or verbal forms.

  

And for your recent questions, the difference between Shastra texts and Literature texts, in using the Dictionary is simple one. Just like one cannot understand a medical text on Surgery or Medicine, with the help of a Standard English Dictionary, one cannot understand the texts of शास्त्र-s which have more than 2 millenium of tradition, with the help of a Standard Dictionary without undergoing training in the relevant discipline.

  

That is why scholars never had to meet the problem posed by you.

  

Hope others would solve your problem how they solved it if they had met it similarly.
