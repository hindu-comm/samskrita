Ajit,  
  
You say, \< Henceforth i will type only in English letters for clarity  
in  
future mails. \>  
  
This is, in fact, the surest way to generate further confusion.  
English (Roman) letters do not adequately reproduce all Devanagari  
letters. Unless all of us agree beforehand to follow the same system  
of transliteration, disagreements will always arise if you write  
Sanskrit as a Romanized text.  
  
The best route is to get down to the task and master typing Sanskrit  
in Devanagari. It is not all that difficult. Several softwares are  
available that help you in this. Do try and get hold of one of  
them...
