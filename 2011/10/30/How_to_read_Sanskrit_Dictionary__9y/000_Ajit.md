Hi  
1 How does one read a Sanskrit dictionary? ( I know directions of how  
to use a dictionary is given)  
  
2 How does one know the meaning of a given word ( Dictionaries give  
meaning of verbal base or stem of a word)  
so one needs to know grammar to read a dictionary and needs a  
dictionary to understand grammar. how does one go about in these  
situations  
  
3 All possible derivatives are not listed  
  
Is there any easy or straight forward way in Sanskrit to use a  
dictionary as one can use a standard English dictionary.  
  
Thanks
