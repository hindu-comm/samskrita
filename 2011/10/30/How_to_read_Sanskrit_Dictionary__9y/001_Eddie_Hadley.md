Ajit,



 Some formal study of Grammar in ones own language, is an advantage.

Then, as ever, you learn the grammar and vocabulary in parallel, a bit at a time, from the simple level to the advanced.



You could do worse than start with *A Practical Sanskrit Introductory* by Charles Wikner, 1996.



"This course of fifteen lessons is intended to lift the English speaking student who

knows nothing of Sanskrit, to the level where he can intelligently apply Monier -

Williams dictionary and the Dhātu-Pāt ha to the study of the scriptures ."



It is freely available in various formats, including printable. Just scan for the title.

His wish was that his work be translated into other languages.



But there are many good tutorials around, also in English.



 Eddie
