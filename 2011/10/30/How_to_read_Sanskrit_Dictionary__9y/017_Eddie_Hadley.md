Vimala,



“I hope you don’t mind a slight correction.

*tvam is not vocative* – it is nominative and its use is optional in the interrogative, so tvam kim karoSi is fine.

“



Thank you Vimala, but no correction is needed.



“You put the pronoun as the first word, which suggests the vocative, except that the inflection is not in the vocative case.”



 Eddie
