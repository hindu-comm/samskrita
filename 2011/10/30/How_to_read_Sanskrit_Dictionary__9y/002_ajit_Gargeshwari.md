hi  
Let me give a Sanskrit sentence त्वं किम करोषि ?  
In English one Says What are you doing?  
If I look into a standard English dictionary I can spot all the 4 words  
Where as if i look into a standard Sanskrit dictionary i may not find करोषि I will find कृ धातु  
So the problem a beginner or even and advanced reader when he develops a vocabulary of a few hundred words might find understanding Sanskrit difficult  
It is one thing to roughly understand a simple text and yet another ball game if one wants to understand a standard Shastric Sanskrit text.  
  
If a person is given a English text and a Bilingual dictionary one can roughly translate the English book ( I presume the person has a rudimentary concept of Grammar). But it might be difficult to do the same if one is given a Sanskrit Text and a bilingual dictionary.  
I wanted to understand how Scholars have got over this problem? So are there standard and logical principals one needs to know apart from a dictionary and Grammar books to understand Sanskrit.? What are the principal a scholar applies to find word meaning while using a dictionary  
This is the scenario I had in mind  
Thanks  
Ajit Gargeshwari
