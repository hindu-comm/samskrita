Dear Ajit Mahodaya

In the English also the dictionary will not give entries for verb conjugations – you will find **do** but not **doing.**

A dictionary is a reference book for one who already knows the grammar – it is not a text on grammar.

In Sanskrit the situalion is more complicated because you have also to know phonetic rules for example when s changes to retroflex and the way anusvara is listed in the dictionary order has already been discussed.

I think Arvind – Ji mentioned Bhandarkar grammars – which introduces grammar and vocabulary at the same time and this a good way to start.

Some of the members of this group have very good blog sites too for learning both grammar and vocabulary – like Abhyankar’ s and GGS Murthy’s sites

So are there standard and logical principals one needs to know apart from a dictionary and Grammar books to understand Sanskrit?

The answer is of course yes and there is no simple shortcuts. These grammatical principles, phonology (sound rules or sandhi) and vocabulary and take some time. As pointed out by Bhatt Mahodaya not only does one need grammar and vocabulary, one also has to know usage of a word for the text to make sense of a translation, and appreciating alankaras to really start to enjoy the language. A dictionary may give contradictory meanings for a single word but usage in a sentence will indicate the correct meaning. Vedic language is even more difficult and should only attempted after know the grammar of classical Sanskrit.
