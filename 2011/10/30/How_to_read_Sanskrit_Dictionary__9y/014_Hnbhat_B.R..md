Generally the personal pronouns are not used in the vocative. "त्यादादेः सम्बोधनं नास्तीत्युत्सर्गः" "tyadādeḥsambodhanaṃ nāstīty utsargaḥ" is the general norm by the Indian Grammarian tradition. Rare usages like in Mahabhashya are accepted as irregular cases. "he saḥ" etc. but not regular in usage.

  

Even if split, त्वम् will take verb असि, make a separate sentence thereby It is you there! and second sentence split with another त्वम् implied by the verb to complete the question What are you doing there?
