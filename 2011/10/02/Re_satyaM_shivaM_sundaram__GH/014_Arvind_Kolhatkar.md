Dear Group,  
  
I think we are straying away from the topic in hand. The original  
query was 'Would any of the learned members know of an ancient text  
showing this  
phrase?', the phrase being the well-known words 'satyam shivam  
sundaram.  
  
There was the well-known film of that name made in 1978 and a song  
which is still heard, especially in public celebrations of semi-  
religious nature like the Ganeshchaturthi. However, The phrase is  
certainly far older. I do not think that Bollywood, which otherwise  
is quite innocent of Sanskrit, would have selected this phrase as the  
name of a movie had it not been already quite well-known. An attempt  
to trace the origin of this phrase is certainly worth an attempt.  
  
A partial answer has been given by Nityananda Misra by tracing its  
use back to 1712. Can we take it back further and trace the first  
time it was used?
