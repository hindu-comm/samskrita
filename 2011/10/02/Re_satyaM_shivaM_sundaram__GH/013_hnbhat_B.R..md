Dear Vishwanath,

  

Please do not deviate from the main focus of the question. If you have anything to say, please provide reference and not mere guessing.

  

Can you show पञ्चाक्षरमन्त्र is directly taken from कृष्णयजुर्वेद with precise reference to the location? Anyhow you can start a new thread if you have the reference and ask the opinion of others if you want.

  

It is not the question on the history of the word शिव, but the expression as such "सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्" as Brian seemed to explore. Individually, all the three words can be traced back to Earliest literatures, as all are Sanskrit words and having different meanings for each. All the three used as adjectives also and why to personalize it to divine characters? When you deviate from the focus of the thread, better to start a new thread with a new subject line than dragging over the same in diverse directions.

  

I agree with Vidya in that matter. Hope this would add to the design of the forum topics also a good look and interesting to read newer topics.
