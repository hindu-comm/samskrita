Dear Dr, Bhat  

All we can do is to browse through Vedic Concordance of Blookfield, and Upanishat concordance and Upanishad VakyaMahakosha (both are different) available with us.  
  

A Vedic concordance by Maurice Bloomfield right, or is there another concordance by Blookfield.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
