Namaste Smt. Vimala!

  

The request is for resolution of "satyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram". Why would one jump from this question to "...Shiva but the temperamental minor deity," Where do the words 'shiva' occur? What are the meanings for that word? "shivaaste panthAnaH santu" occurs in shAkuntalam. Does one interpret it as "may the temperamental and minor deity accompany you on your way"?

  

Quoting "Rudra (crier or howler)" only takes the discussion further away from the original question.

  

In response to Shri Brian:

"I am looking for an ancient source for the description of Divinity assatyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram." Can you please tell us where you found this description of Divinity? It might help in responses being more directed towards giving you an answer you are looking for.

  

Respectful of True Knowledge,

  
Vidya
