By the quotation itself has superlative degree of the adjectives शिव and शिवतर are used as adjectives for शम्भु or रुद्र the main deity of the रुद्राध्याय and doesn't in any way indicate शिव is the deity praised in this portion as it is also among one of the adjectives used in praise of रुद्र. Any comments are welcome and free at the desire and inclination of the devotees.
