Dear shri Bhat,  
  
My apologies since it seems that I was wrong and could have been more clear.  
  
I was merely responding to Mm, Vimala's assertion that Shiva doesn't find place in early vedic literature. I knew that shiva is revered in Taittiriya Samhita, 4th kanda, 5th prasna, 17th panasa. (I wasn't guessing for sure). So I thought I could mention this. I could have avoided the word panchakshari.  
  
I also got confused with the minor diety thing. That was completely my mistake.  
  
Viswanath
