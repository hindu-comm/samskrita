I think this is a modern phrase (20^(th) century?). The early vedic texts do not mention Shiva but the temperamental minor deity, Rudra (crier or howler) who was associated with storms and winds (he is father of the Maruts), whose fierce and destructive force had to be appeased.
By the time the Ramayana was written (circa 500 BCE onwards) Shiva was already a fully-fledged all-powerful deity, and Rudra is supplanted.
Ravana is said to be a great bhakti and of course there is the famous bow of Shiva which Rama lifted and strung to win Sita. Kashmiri Shaivism was flourishing in the north at the time of Kalidasa (500 CE), and sect pre-dates the Vaishnava sect. The later epic Mahabharata mentions a number of Shiva stories – including Arjuna’s encounter with the God whom he mistakes for a hunter in this quest for Shiva’s weapon . This text has embedded in it the Gita which makes Krishna the supreme deity.



This brief synopsis may be simplistic, but it is historically accurate.
The traditionalists in the group may want to add their perspectives.
