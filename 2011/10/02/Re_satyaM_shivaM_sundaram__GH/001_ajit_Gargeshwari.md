Hi  
My guess would be the phrase "satyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram" is just an expression ( different interpretation and analysis can be given on the phrase). I could not find this sentence or phrase in any of the principal upanishads or in Upanishad Vakya Kosha of Jacob Or Vedic Index of Macdonell and Keith.  
Satyam Gyanam anantam Bramha can be found in the Taittiriya Upanishad and BrahadaAranyaka Upanishads.  
  
The phrase I think became famous due to the Famous Hindi movie which has the same title  
  
  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
