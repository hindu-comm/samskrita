I think it is the same as referred to by Nithyananda Mishra in his post 3rd message in this thread and also I have already noticed in some other web pages also. It may possibly the Hindi film director chose his name from this anecdote of Ramacarit Manas for his film सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम् as it was popularized by the biography by the time. Any fresh earlier references are welcome.
