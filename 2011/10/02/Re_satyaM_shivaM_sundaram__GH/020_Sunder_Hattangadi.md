Authentic Biography of Tulsidas Ji



".......



Protests and Magical Events



Ramcharitmanas soon gained popularity far and wide, so much so that jealous pandits created a hue and cry in Kashi. They protested that composing Shri Ram Katha in vernacular language inflicted insult on Sanskrit, a language of gods. But truth remains truth. With the aim of testing this new scripture, Ramcharitmanas was put at the top of all scriptures in the temple of Shri Vishvanath ji in Kashi and the door was closed. Next day in the morning, when the temple door was opened, Ramcharitmanas was found lying at the bottom of all scriptures and ****its first page had the signature of Lord Vishvanath Himself- "सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरं" (Satyam Shivam Sundaram).**** The incident left everyone dumbstruck. It made everyone ``accept the fact that if Sanskrit is "devbhasha", then the language of ShriRamcharitmanas is "Mahadevbhasha"! Because despite being a great scholar of Sanskrit himself, Goswamiji chose vernacular language due to Lord Shiva's will and instructions.
