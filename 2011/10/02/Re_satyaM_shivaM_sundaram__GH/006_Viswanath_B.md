This is not true, especially since the *panchakshari* is right in the middle of Krishna Yajurveda. I am not sure how you thought so. Infact if you read through the *rudradhyaya,* you will find that shiva is not a minor diety.  
  
I also think there is a definition of *rudra*, as the one who causes the effect (crying etc), as opposed to one who cries. I don't have this correctly, but it goes like *rudrAyatIti rudraH.* Learned members can correct me.
