The phrase was used at least several centuries before the movie. There is a commentary on *Bhaktamal* (composed by Nabhadas between 1583 and 1639) titled *Bhaktirasbodhini* composed by Priyadas in 1712. In the gloss on the *Chappaya* verse on Tulsidas, who Nabhadas calls the *Sumeru* of the *Bhaktamal*, occurs a record of a miracle attributed to Tulsidas when Brahmins of Varanasi tested the worth of Ramcharitmanas by placing it under the Vedas and other Sanskrit scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Kashi Vishvanath Temple in Varanasi. The doors were locked, and when opened in the morning, the Brahmins found the words *satyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram* inscribed in the manuscript. So the phrase was in use before 1712 AD is what we can say.
