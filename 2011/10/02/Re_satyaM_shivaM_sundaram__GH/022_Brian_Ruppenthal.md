Friends,  

  

Thanks to many on this list who helped in looking for the 'satyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram' phrase in sacred texts.

  

For my part, I took the suggestion that it would be found in Adi Shankara's Kaṭhopaniṣad-bhāṣyam. But I could not find it there. However, I have that text in hard-copy only, so my search was by eye and not electronic. Perhaps an electronic search would work better?

  

I did find this closely-related phrase in the Vedānta-sūtra-s, and therefore also in Shankara's famous Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣyam (third adhyāya, pāda 2, line 15):

  

सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म

satyaṃ jñānam anantaṃ brahma

  

Perhaps others were thinking of this similar phrase, and source?

  

Again, thanks for all the efforts. And having now gotten so close, maybe someone will stumble on an actual instance of the phrase.

  

Brian
