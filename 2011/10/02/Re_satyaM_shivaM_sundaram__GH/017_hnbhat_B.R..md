Dear Friend,

  

Any quotation naming रुद्र as शिव would help to understand the hymn precisely, than referring to location. Did you mean पञ्चाक्षरी mantra is to be found in the above location or a praise you guess dedicated to शिव is to be found there? If you are sure, you can quote the lines here in praise of शिव in the location.

  

Mm. Vimala just mentioned रुद्र was a minor diety in Rigveda and never referred to Yajurveda or शिव as you wrongly got confused. Even for रुद्र etc. synonyms they need not necessarily denote the deity शिव or रुद्र unless through the media of पुराण-s and शाक्त, शैव cults. For that matter, the word शिव itself occurs in Rigveda itself many times, but not in any case it has been commented as related to a deity as depicted in पुराण-s and the sectarian cults.

  

Sorry I am afraid I am deviating out of the focus point of the thread. But for certainty, the exact expression in question सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम् could not be traced to any उपनिषत् in both the Upanishadic Concordance (English and Sanskrit) and also not in the Vedic Concordance of Bloomfield.

The above is all with quarters beginning with the word satyaM found in the concordance. If any other precise occurrences in the same sequence, to be looked for and will take long time, please come up with.
