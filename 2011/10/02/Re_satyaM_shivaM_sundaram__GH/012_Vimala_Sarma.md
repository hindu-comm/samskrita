Namaste Vidya

I am afraid you have misunderstood me. How do you get the interpretation “may the temperamental and minor deity accompany you on your way"? in Kalidasa’s Sakuntala from my post?

What I said was:

By the time the Ramayana was written (circa 500 BCE onwards) Shiva was already a fully-fledged all-powerful deity, and Rudra is supplanted.
Please see my post again.
