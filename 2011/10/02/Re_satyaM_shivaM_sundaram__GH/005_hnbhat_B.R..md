I remember a film named सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम् (1978) and the song with the same title lyrics by Pt. Narendra Sharma, sung by Lataji is still in my memory. But I too don't remember any such phrase in Vedic Literature.

  

But I can't say I can't find it at all as I ever remember the advice of Patanjali, महान् खलु शब्दस्य विषयः .... एतावन्तं शब्दराशिमननुनिशम्य साहासमेतत् अप्रयुक्तमेतत् इति।

  

All we can do is to browse through Vedic Concordance of Blookfield, and Upanishat concordance and Upanishad VakyaMahakosha (both are different) available with us.
