Dear shri Bhat,  
  
I would limit my response to just the reference.  
  
The whole of the 5th prasna i mentioned below is called rudradhyaya, also called namaka prasna, also called namakam, a daily mandated recital for many.  
  
The 17th panasa inside it contains the following (i couldn't add the swara marks, ) I've highlighted the relevant portion.  
  
नम श्शम्भवॆच मयॊभवॆच नम श्शङ्करायच मयस्करायच नम श्शिवायच शिवतरायच  
  
I didn't quote this, since in my opinion, its a popular knowledge of the presence of the highlighted portion in Taittiria Samhita. My mistake.  
  
Viswanath
