Friends,  

  

I am looking for an ancient source for the description of Divinity as satyaṃ śivaṃ sundaram. I have looked for it in the Ṛgveda without, so far, any luck. My next guess would be the Upaniśad-s. But which one or ones? 

  

Would any of the learned members know of an ancient text showing this phrase?

  

Thanks in advance,

  

Brian
