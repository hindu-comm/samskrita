There is much more to phonology than just phonetics. Phonetics deals with individual sounds (phonemes) of which there are around 400 in the world. Panini was no world phonetician like Henry Higgins of bernard shaw's Pygmalion so expecting him to describe all phonemes of world is like expecting Kalidasa to know French and German words. As Mr Bhatt pointed out, he was describing sanskrit and not other languages.

  

Phonology is a much broader area which includes things like sandhi, which is a phonological combination of phonemes. When it comes to phonology and morphophonology, panini's extensive treatment of the subject is probably unparalleled.

  

Even restricting to just phonetics, his arrangement of phonemes in the shiva sutras are a mathematical miracle as discussed in a recent thread.
