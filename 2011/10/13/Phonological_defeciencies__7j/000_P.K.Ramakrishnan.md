Panini is acclaimed as the world's greatest phonological scientist. But it would

appear that he has confined himself to Sanskrit. There are some vowels like

short 'a' and short 'o' found in some languages like Tamil and English but not

in Sanskrit as givenbelow. Can someone try to explain this.

  

Tamil

erumai எருமை --- रुमै

ettam ஏத்த்ம் एत्तम्

oruvan ஒருவன் --रुवन्

ottam ஓட்ட்ம் ओट्टम्

  

English

ever ---वर्

ancient एन्स्यन्ट्

oppose ---पॊस्

opera ओपरा
