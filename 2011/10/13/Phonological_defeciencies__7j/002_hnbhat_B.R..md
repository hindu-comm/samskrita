I don't understand why to expect Panini's Grammar explain all the phonems in the languages of the world?  
  
There are more than 300 languages in India, and I can see no justification in expecting Panini explain them in his Grammar basically meant for Sanskrit language and casually describe Vedic vocabulary. In the world more than 3000 languages. One can allege deficiency of Panini for nor describing them all in this way in his work Ashtadhyayi, if it is the objective of this post.

  

As pointed out in some other thread, short "e" and "o" some more were present at a time in Vedic texts, but lost by the time of Panini when he described the language. It is not the fault of Panini, that they were lost of usage by his time. How can he be responsible for the phonemes of other languages when his grammar was meant for Sanskrit ?

  

Others comments are welcome.
