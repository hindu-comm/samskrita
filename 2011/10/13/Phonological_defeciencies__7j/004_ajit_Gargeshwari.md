Dear Sri Ramakrishnan  
Please read the scope of any book. Can one book explain everything? Panini never claimed he is writing an encyclopedia did he ever. You want to understand from Panini Grammar of Bhasha ( ie. Classical Sanskrit) correct. Panini Grammar is applicable for Classical Sanskrit he doesn't Talk about Tamil, Kannada or Urdu Grammar does he ever. Did English as a language exist during his time please read the evolution English language. Your questions need to be precise if you expect precise answers.  
If I say Panini doesn't talk French does it make sense?  
Ps he didn't confine to Sanskrit alone he confined himself to Bhasha that was in current usage at his time.  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
