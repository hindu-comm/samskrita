IIRC, a dvigu samaasa or a samaahaara dvandva is either neuter or feminine. Examples are pa\~ncatantram and navaraatram for neuter and tripaadii, a.s.taadhyaayii for feminine. I don't know what rules determine this so the learned may point out if it is "sataabdam or "sataabdii.

  

I have used Velthius transliteration above.
