Thanks for the compiled verse. The Charvaka line is here below.

  

It is this:

  

यावज्जीवेत् सुखं जीवेदृणं कृत्वा घृतं पिबेत्।

भस्मीभूतस्य देहस्य पुनरागमनं कुतः?

  

By the way, the verse दानं भोगो नाश is deffective in its 2nd paada as noticed by Arvind, which should contain 18 मात्रा-s where as there are only 17.

  

यस्या:*पादे प्रथमे द्वादश*मात्रा तथा तृतीयेऽपि \|. अष्टादश द्वितीये चतुर्थे पञ्चदश सार्या \|\|**...**

  

to become perfect आर्या. Please check once again.

  
With regards
