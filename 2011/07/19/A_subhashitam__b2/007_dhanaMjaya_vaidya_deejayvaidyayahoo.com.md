Let me add a verse I made up.

यो न दाता ददात्येव नाद्य वै मरणोत्तरम् ।  
भस्मीभूतस्य देहस्य यशो नास्ति न वा सुखम् ॥

Meaning: He who will not give does indeed give, not today but after  
death. Once the body has turned into ashes, (with no consideration of  
it) there is neither fame, nor is there pleasure.

(The third quarter of the verse is a quotation from a supposed  
chArvAka verse. The quotation is meant to invoke the choice of  
spending money for enjoyment in life, if not giving.)
