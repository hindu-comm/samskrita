It is short by one मात्रा, which could be adjusted by using the flexibility of the rule for short and long syllables, at the end of पादान्त which can be read as Guru if needed so. Here too, the last syllable can be taken as Guru, for metrical purpose. This is the general rule accepted by Pingala and other writers on prosody in Sanskrit.
