A lot of etymological surmises, be they by ancient scholars, or the contemporary curious, are quite fanciful.  
  
It would be interesting to see how vEtra, nEtra, chAtra, mUtra, patra, lavitra, khanitra would figure into this toy model.  
  
On a serious note, the -tra suffix as indicative of functionality can be discerned in words like khanitra, pavitra and lavitra.  
  
The others don't seem to have any philological common ground.  
  
Respectfully,  
Naresh Keerthi
