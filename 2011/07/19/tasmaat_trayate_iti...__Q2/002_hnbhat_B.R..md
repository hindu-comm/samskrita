Dear Arvind is probably 90% correct. Influened by the definition of क्षत्र in Raghuvamsha, all the words ending in त्र are attempted here in a fanciful way. I am trying to get the Etymological explanation and other more fanciful explanations for the above words. But I doubt whether such an attempt will be rewarding. This tendency reached its extremity in applying it to पात्र as well.
