The etymological possibility of the above word explained by Kalidasa, which is based on the etymology क्षत् - क्षतम्,+ त्रैङ् पालाने + क - त्र; क्षत्+त्र - क्षत्त्र;("**6-4-40 गमः क्वौ"**इत्यत्र "गमादीनामुपख्यानम्" इति वार्तिकात्, "क्षणु हिंसायाम्" इतिधातोःभावे क्विप्प्रत्ययेअनुनासिकलोपः, तुगागमश्च, क्षणॊतीति क्षत् - क्षण्+क्विप् क्षतमित्यर्थः;तस्मात् क्षतात्त्रायते इति क्षत्+त्र \>\> क्षत्त्रः);



The above explanation is based on the clue given by Mallinatha in his commentary on the verse. It should be now clear that Kaliasa, just hinted the possibility with his explanation in other words and not astrict etymology is intended by the explanation.



Mallinatha seems to be right in his assessment asin no other way it can be derived. Even though



"गु-धृ-वी-पचि-वचि-यमि-सदि-***क्षदि***-भ्यः त्रः"(उणादि ४.१६६) derives the word from the root क्षद्with the suffixत्र, there is no such verb available in पाणिनीयधातुपाठ, and as such it could be considered as underived word, according to Paninian standard. Keeping this in view, it can be said fanciful derivation.
