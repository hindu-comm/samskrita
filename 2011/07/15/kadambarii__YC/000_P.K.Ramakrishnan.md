कादंबरीरसज्नानां आहारोपि न रोचते /

  

Thre is a pun in this statement.

  

Kadambari is a fascinating novel written by Bana.

When someone is immersed in its flavour he

forgets to eat his food.

  

Kadamabari also means spiritous liqour.

Those who are addicted to this do not

like to eat usual food.
