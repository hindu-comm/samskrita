Thanks Ramakrishnan for the nice saying about Bana.



Here is one more, depicting him as the male incarnation of Sarasvati, in order to attain more scholarship:



जाता शिखण्डिनी प्राक् यथा शिखण्डी तथावगच्छामि \|  
  
प्रागल्भ्यमधिकमवाप्तुं वाणी बाणो बभूव ह \|\|  

Like शिखण्डिनी born as female, became शिखण्डी (male) laterto acquire morepower (enough to kill Bhishma, Ambalika, the last daughter of Kashiraja, born againto revenge gaining more power), वाणीtoo became बाणagain.
