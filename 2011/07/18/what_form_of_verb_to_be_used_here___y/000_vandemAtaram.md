Hi,

Suppose I want to say "The boy eats two laddoos". So will it be -  
बालकः मोदकौ खादति  
or  
बालकः मोदकौ खादतः  
I mean, should the form of the verb be in consonance with the subject  
(which is singular here) or the object (मोदक् - which is dual) here?

I know it is a very silly doubt, but I am still a greenhorn here!

Thanking you,
