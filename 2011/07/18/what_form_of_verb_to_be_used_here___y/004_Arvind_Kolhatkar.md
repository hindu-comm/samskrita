Dhananjay,

You say:

\<बालकः मोदकौ खादति । (verb in kartari form agrees with katR)  
बालकेन मोदके खाद्येते । (verb in karmaNi form agrees with karman)>

मोदक, the noun meaning a sweet round confection, can be m. or n. If  
you take it as m. the two sentences should be

बालकः मोदकौ खादति । (verb in kartari form agrees with katR)  

बालकेन मोदकौ खाद्येते । (verb in karmaNi form agrees with karman).

Incidentally, our teacher had told us a funny story about this word.  
A king, not very learned but with pretensions to high culture, had  
ordered that in his presence only Sanskrit should be spoken. Once he  
was doing jalavihaara with his queens and playfully threw water at his  
favorite among them. She, remembering the royal proclivity towards  
Sanskrit, remonstrated with his in Sanskrit:

मोदकैः सिञ्च माम्।

The king, happy to oblige, ordered his attendants to rush to the royal  
kitchen, gather as many मोदक as they could and pelt his beloved with  
them.
