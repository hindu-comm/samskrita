To be precise, the verb in kartari agrees with the kartR, and the verb  
in the kamaNi agrees with the karman  
  
So the correct forms are :  
बालकः मोदकौ खादति । (verb in kartari form agrees with katR)  
बालकेन मोदके खाद्येते । (verb in karmaNi form agrees with karman)  
  
(The meanining of the English term "subject" is ambiguous in this  
context. If "subject" means both katR and karman, the above  
clarification is not needed.)
