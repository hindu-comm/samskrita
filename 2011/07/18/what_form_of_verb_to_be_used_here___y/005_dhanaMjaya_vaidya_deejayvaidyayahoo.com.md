Thanks! What an embarrassing typo in such a short message of mine :-)  
  
In fact I meant "modakau" in both sentences, as correctly edited by  
Arvind.  
  
"modakaiH" in its two meanings has different word stress patterns.  
(But that detail is not part of the traditional story.)  
  
The story I heard as a child was that this was a famous founder of a  
new dynasty - probably Shalivahana - and he did not know saMskRta  
because of his humble origins. His queen, however, was of genteel  
upbringing, and thus spoke saMskRta. After the "modakaiH tADaya"  
fiasco, the king was motivated to learn both saMskRta and paishaachii  
languages.
