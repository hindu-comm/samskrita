============

  

The story goes that after the episode, the King, who was the patron of गुणाढ्य, a great scholar of his time, (the author of बृहत्कथा") requested him to teach him Sanskrit within Six months and the great scholar rejected it as impossible to comply with his request. Another scholar of his Court, शर्ववर्मन् challenged him and promised to teach him within that period. Challenged by this, staked his scholarship in Sanskrit and challenged him if he can accomplish the king with Sanskrit language within the specified period, he would stop using Sanskrit language. शर्ववर्मन् specially designed a grammar for teaching the king, which is still called कातन्त्र व्याकरण and and succedeed in teaching him the language as required by him within the period. As per his bet, गुणवर्मन् stopped using Sanskrit for writing and lived in forest in excile. He wrote बृहत्कथा using पैशाची language which became popular collection of stories, retold again in बृहत्कथामञ्जरी in Sanskrit by क्षेमेन्द्र. This is the background of the story you have heard.

  

This is one version of the story of how बृहत्कथा in पैशाची was created. For the full version, please read it:
