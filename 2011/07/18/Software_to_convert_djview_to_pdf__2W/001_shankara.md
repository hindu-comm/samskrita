Subramanyaji,

  

If you have a pdf printer like pdf factory, adobe acrobat pro, etc you can take a pdf print of djvu.  

There are may free softwares meant only for converting djvu to pdf. I used "Djvulibre" from <http://djvutopdf.com/> for converting "Avasthatraya", a publication of Adhyatma Karyalaya. It is a free software and is very easy to use.  



regards  
shankara
