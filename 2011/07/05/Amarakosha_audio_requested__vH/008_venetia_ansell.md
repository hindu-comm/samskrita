One small correction - Samskrita Bharati's new India website is in fact [www.samskritabharati.org](http://www.samskritabharati.org/). The address given below hosts the electronic copies of their monthly magazine.

I would second what has been said about copyright. If anyone is unable to get the casette or CD from Samskrita Bharati for whatever reason I am more than happy to upload my mp3 version but I would encourage a donation to Samskrita Bharati especially as they are a voluntary organisation. I seem to remember that the CD cost me about 100 rupees.
