Dear Venetia / Vasu Mahodayau!  
  
If the recordings are copyrighted, they should certainly not be uploaded. That is why I mentioned of the option only if I was unable to procure them from my Samskrita-Bharati friends in Mumbai. I will definitely ensure that no copy-right violations are caused.  
  
Regards,  
Jaideep
