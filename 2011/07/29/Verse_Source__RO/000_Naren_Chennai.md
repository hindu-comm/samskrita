Dear All,

Namaste.

I would like to know where the following verse comes from:

yAvad jananam tavad maraNam  
tAvad jananI jaThare shayanam  
iti samsAre spuTatara-doshaH  
kathamiha mAnava tava santoShaH

I request the learned members of the group to help me in this regard.  
It looked like from "Bhajagovindam" on a first look. But it was not  
from there.

With regards,  
Naren.
