Both are fro Shankara's Bhaja-Govindam (or Moha-``mudgara), and may be considered 'pAThabheda' (variants).



The verse beginning with 'yAvad jananam....' appears as such in William Jones paper at:

I am recollecting this from memory-

  

पुनरपि जननं पुनरपि मरणं पुनरपि जननीजठरे शयनम् /

इह संसारे बहुदुस्तारे कृपाया पारे पाहि मुरारे //

  

Do not know the source.

Dear All,  
  
Namaste.  
  
I would like to know where the following verse comes from:  
  
yAvad jananam tavad maraNam  
tAvad jananI jaThare shayanam  
iti samsAre spuTatara-doshaH  
kathamiha mAnava tava santoShaH  
  
I request the learned members of the group to help me in this regard.  
It looked like from "Bhajagovindam" on a first look. But it was not  
from there.  
  
With regards,  
Naren.
