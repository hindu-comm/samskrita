Dev,  

  

By a quick web search I found this:

  

(oṁ) apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato ’pi vā  

yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bāhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ  

  

"Whether pure or impure, or having passed through all conditions of material life, one who remembers lotus-eyed Kṛṣṇa becomes externally and internally clean." \[Garuḍa Purāṇa\] 

  

I found the other one too, as a quote, but so far have not seen the source.

  

Brian
