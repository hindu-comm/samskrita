आन्वीक्षिकी - I am not sure about this word has meaning argumentative, in the sense of being difficult or quarrelsome. I think it has the sense of following through an examination – scientific enquiry, reasoning through something, etc.

Halbfass considered this word in terms of a possible equivalent of “philosophical enquiry for this own sake”.

युक्तियुक्त – has the sense of “battling or fighting”
