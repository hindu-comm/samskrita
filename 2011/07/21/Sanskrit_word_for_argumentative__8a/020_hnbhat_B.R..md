वाचोयुक्तिपटुर्वाग्ग्मी वावदूको ऽतिवक्तरि॥ इत्यमरः ३.१.३५॥  
  

As it appears, it is used either for talkative or eloquent.

  

MBh, 12, 19, 24.2  
caranti vasudhāṃ kṛtsnāṃ**vāvadūkā**bahuśrutāḥ //

  

Here is the meaning given in Digital Sanskrit Corpus:

  

## Meanings

-   disputatious (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   eloquent (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   garrulous (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   talking much (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)

In all these complimentary and pejorative meanings the word can be used.  
  

पुनःपुनरतिशयेन वा वदतीति वावदूकः।

  

  

If we take the first two as complimentary, the next set explaining वावदूक as अतिवक्तरि then this word has some pejorative connotation too. But by itself it doesn't carry such connotation only literally fluently speaking on any topic the best.
