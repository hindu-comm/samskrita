Here is a reference to Adi Shankara’s characterization of jalpa,  
vitanda, and vaada: <http://panchnadludhiana.org/about_us.php>.  
  
“Shankaracharya has characterized the techniques of discussion as  
jalpa, vitandaa and vaada. In jalpa, the attempt is to smother  
opposition by vehement criticism and rejoinders with overbearing  
arrogance in assertion; and in vitandaa the aim is simply to destroy  
the edifice of the opponent's arguments even by foul means and  
methods.”  
  
In vaada, both parties seek the Truth and argue based on the four  
pramANas (members with access to Adi Shankara’s relevant work may add  
further). vaada alone is the accepted tradition in ‘nyaaya’. The  
ancients said, “vaade vaade jayate tatvabodhah.” It ends with “tat  
tvam” realization. I guess that is what ‘tatvabodha’ really means.  
  
Any of these (jalpa, vitanda, or vaada) or their derivatives as  
‘argumentative’ is a stretch. An argumentative person argues for the  
sake of arguing; his objective is not seeking (or decimating) truth or  
knowledge. He by nature disagrees with any point of view while he has  
nothing to offer to the discussion/debate. He simply disagrees with  
whatever is the pUrvapakSa position. Fact or fiction is irrelevant to  
an argumentative person.  
  
Possibly, ‘kutarki’ comes close to 'agrumentative.'
