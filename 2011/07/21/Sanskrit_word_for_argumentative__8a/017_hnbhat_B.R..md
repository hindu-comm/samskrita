Thanks for the NEW word*Wadaprava*

i HAVE NOT COME ACROSS in so far as I remember.

  

Why no one have has ever thought of the popular word विवादः or its derivative विवादी, than resorting to technical words, as is known in the pejorative sense = argument for argument's sake:

  

विद्या विवादाय -धनं मदाय शक्तिः परेषां परिपीडनाय।

खलस्य साधोर्विपरीतमेतत् ज्ञानाय दानाय च रक्षणाय॥
