Samata Books has brought out a number of Samskrit books in very good quality print. They are to be lauded in their efforts.  
Perhaps the best way we can all contribute to the cause is by buying books (and reading them!).  
  
The World Samskrit Book Fair held in Bangalore earlier this year showed that there is certainly a market for such books. I hope Samata Books was able to utilize the opportunity as well.
