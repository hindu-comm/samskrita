Dear Friends,

Namaste,

I am V.Krishna s/o Sri V.SADANAND, Founder, SAMATA BOOKS, Chennai, India. My Father had published THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ADI SANKARACHARYA IN TEN VOLUMES IN SANSKRIT, with the SRIMUKHAM from the Sri SRINGERI ACHARYAS. He followed it up with THE BHAGAVAD GITA, with the Commentary of ADI SANKARACHARYA, with the translation in English by ALLADI MAHADEVA SASTRY. He had also Published THE DAKSHINAMURTI STOTRA, THE TAITTIRIYA UPANISHAD, PRABODHASUDHAKARA(COMMENTARIES OF ADI SANKARACHARYA AND TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH). He then went on to publish JNANESHWARI AND AMRITANUBHAVA by Sri JNANADEVA, THE TEN GREAT COSMIC POWERS(DASA MAHA VIDYA), SRI CHAKRA, GOSPEL OF BUDDHA, ESSENCE OF YOGAVASISHTHA, THE VISION OF WAY OF VASISHTHA, WAY TO SUPREME BLISS AND ESSENCE OF TRIPURARAHASYA. 

My Father was a Freedom Fighter, who had not even claimed his Tamara Patra and his Freedom Fighter's Pension. We do not have a permanent Capital base. Due to Paucity of Funds we are unable to reprint most of our Publications. If like minded souls come together and help us by way of Donating Funds we can continue the publications and the retail bookstore. At the retail bookstore, we sell books from similar publishers like SRI RAMAKRISHAN MATH, SRI RAMANA ASHRAM, SWAMI RAMA, SWAMI CHINMAYANANDA, SWAMI JYOTIRMAYANANDA, BIHAR SCHOOL OF YOGA, PARAMAHAMSA NITYANANDA AND SWAMI MUKTANANDA OF GANESHPURI(Maharashtra), SWAMI SIVANANDA, THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, SRI AUROBINDO AND THE MOTHER amongst the others. 

Pranams.

Krishna V
