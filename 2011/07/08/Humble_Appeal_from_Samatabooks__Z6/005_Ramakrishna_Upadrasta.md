namaste,

  
I completely agree with what Shri Naresh has said. The complete works  
of Shankaracharya by Samata books's are a real great piece of  
publication and need to be in in everyone's top sanskrit reading list.

I encourage anyone to buy and everyone to read the books to the best  
of their ability.

Also, thanks for suggesting the books to your local library for  
purchasing a copy. This is one indirect way of helping publications  
like Samata, as well as helping the library and future readers as  
well.

namaste  
Ramakrishna
