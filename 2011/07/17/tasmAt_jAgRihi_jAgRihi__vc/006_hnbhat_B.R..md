I think it is the reverse of the story. Appaya Dikshita was going to Ganges and foundJagannatha lying on the steps to Ganges:

He was lying on the Ghat, with his Yavani, lover, counting his last days, covered with a blanket both, and on listening to the voice of his rival, he raised his rival and then Appaya Dikshita recognized him and completed the second half as above. There is a second part of this story too. On listening to his scorn, immediately Jagannatha started singing the Ganga Lahari, in praise of mother Ganges and on completion of each verse, water of the Ganges came up each step above. As he completed the verse 52 the water came to the step he was lying and washed him away with his lover "yavani". There is a verse attributed to him describing his love to his "yavani":

  

यवनी नवनीतकोमलाङ्गी शयनीये यदि लभ्यते कदाचित्।

अवनीतलमेव साधु मन्ये न वनी माघवनी विनोदहेतुः॥

  

which he kept to his last days as the above story too makes out of it. It may be assumed that if the account taken to be correct, some of his disciples noted down the verses as he composed them. But I don't now whether there were only 52 steps in the ghat, or lying on the 52nd step he composed these verses. There is no testimony than the story came down.
