Dear Dr Bhat,  
  
While these stories about the yavanI are being told and repeated, I am  
skeptical of their veracity and am not sure if they have any  
acceptable evidence behind them.  
  
For one thing, it was not possible for anyone except the Emperor, and  
perhaps his minor sons, to enter the inner court of the Red Fort and  
see any woman of the Zenana, including serving maids. From what I  
have read, there was a red curtain separating the inner court and the  
public areas of the imperial residence and none - certainly no male -  
was allowed to cross it.
