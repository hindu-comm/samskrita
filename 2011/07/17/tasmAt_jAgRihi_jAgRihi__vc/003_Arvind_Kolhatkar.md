The story behind the following verse is that in VaraNasI Jagannaatha  
PaNDita was going to the river Ganga and on the way he saw his arch-  
rival Appayya DIkShita asleep. Jagannaatha said to the sleeping  
rival:

किं निःशङ्कं शेषे शेषे वयसि समागते मृत्यौ।  
अथवा सुखं शयीथा निकटे जागर्ति जाह्नवी जननी॥
