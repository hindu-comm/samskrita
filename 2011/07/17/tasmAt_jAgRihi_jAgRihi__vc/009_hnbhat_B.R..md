It is the same story. But the emperor was not Akbar, but शाह जहान (1628-58 AD) WHO patronized Jagannatha and got from his court the title of पण्डितराज. It was the same girl some यवनी he describes in the भामिनीविलास a lyric, according to same source. 

  

To Shankar:

  

The above episode of last meeting is from the introduction to Kuvalayananda with Alankaracandrika commentary.

  

The general meaning of the verse of the first half is:

  

Why are you lying without any hesitation in this last stage of life when death is knocking the door?

  

The second half, is intended to waken Panditaraja of his licentious past life, and suggested him the recovery from it:

  

Or you can lie down without any worry, as the Ganges is here by your side (who ll will wash all of your sins).

  

Taking the clue from the second half, Jagannatha composed Gangalahari to pray Ganga and attained salvation.



This is the short and long of the episode.

  

The other verses are also beautiful and simply attactive and need not any translation I hope.

  

With regards
