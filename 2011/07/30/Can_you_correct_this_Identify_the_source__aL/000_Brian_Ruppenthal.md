नमो नमः  

  

Learned members,

  

From the recorded audio of a talk, transcribed by someone without knowledge of Sanskrit...  

  

dharmaṃ prasārāya

dharmaṃ prabhuriya

dharma-dvajaṃ prasārāya

dharma-śaṅkaṃ prasūrāya

dharma-duṃdvigaṃ prathārāya

dharmaṃ kuru dharmaṃ kuru dharmaṃ kuru

  

I am trying to identify the source for this stanza, and correct it too as needed.

  

The speaker attributed it to the 2nd century CE Sanskrit poet Aśvaghoṣa.

  

He also said it was in Pāli. But that seems most unlikely, if the author is indeed Aśvaghoṣa. The word 'dharma' for instance, is clearly in Sanskrit and not Pāli. 

  

Do others here confirm that the whole stanza is in Sanskrit?

  

Further details...  

  

I am not familiar with the word 'prabhuriya,' in the second line; and I also suspect it should be 'prabhūrāya'.

  

The transcript has 'prasūriya' in the fourth line, and 'prathāriya' in the fifth. Frankly, I do not know if these make sense. As in the second line too, what would cause an 'iya' ending?   

  

Here is my attempt at translation into English:  

  

For the sake of spreading dharma,  

For... ???  

For unfurling the banner of dharma,  

For blowing the conch of dharma,  

For beating the drum of dharma,  

Practice dharma, practice dharma, practice dharma.  

  

Please correct this as needed and advise as to source, if you can.  

  

Thanks,  

  

Brian
