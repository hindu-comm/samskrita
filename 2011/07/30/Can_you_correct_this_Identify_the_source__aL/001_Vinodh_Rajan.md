Hi,

  

I tried searching for the verses in Buddha Charita

  

<http://dsbc.uwest.edu/node/7224>

  

But couldn't find them there (Its quite possible that I missed).

  

AFAIK its the only (partially) preserved work of Ashvaghosha. \[The Chinese translation has additional chapters preserved in translation\]

  

The other text supposedly composed by him is the "Awakening of Faith", which survives only as a Chinese Translation.
