Dear Group,  
  
Intrigued by the word 'Shatavadhani' in Shatavadhani Dr. R Ganesh in  
the above postings, I checked up Wikipedia and came up with the  
following: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avadhanam>  
  
This is something that is almost unknown in other parts of India. I  
had never heard of this earlier, though 'aShTaavadhaanI' is a common  
word in Marathi, meaning 'someone who very conscious of the happenings  
around him, a multi-tasker in modern parlance.  
  
Have other members of the Group any experience of similar  
performances?
