I remember some parts of an Ashtavadhana telecast in Doordarshan TV, probably almost 30 years ago. Dont remember the name of the person...
It was a humbling show and raw display of minds capabilities.  
  
But the avadhaani did the following things among several others:  
  
1. Untie a complicated threaded knot in hand, all the while answering others  
2. Construct a magic square or some math stuff (a person used to write on board)  
3. Remember verses from Thirukkural given the number (from a total of 1330 kurals)  
4. Say some poems/shloka or couplet backwards  
5. Recall the name of the poet given a poem from Tamil literature.  
6. Counting of a random bell ringing  
  
thats about what i can remember...
