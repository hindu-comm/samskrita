Some time ago I had watched a Ashtavadhana programme held in our institute.



The subjects paid to attention vary differently also. One of them I remember is one of the पृच्छक-s used to sound a ताल at intervals and when others used draw his attention to different topics, such as composition of verse with given restrictions laid by each. The avadhani will be answering them in clockwise in order of the questions asked. When the turn of the person rigning the bell, he will be saying how many times he has rang the cymbal. It was very interesting too.



The mind according to Nyayashastra, the मनः is अणुप्रमाण and it is practically impossible to pay attention to different thing at a time. The mind has to come into contact with each विषय to have cognintion of the thing. It can come be related with one thing and then with another and so on. In case of doing multiple things at a time, such as reading book, singing another song, doing something with the hands etc. It is movingso quick from one to anotherthat the order is not visible to us and we think all the things are done simultaneously. Here the training can increase this capacity of the mind infinitely as we can witness with the avadhana programmes and also memory power is the asset for the programme as I have seen.



Anyhow, I could not understand what is meant on Bhagavadgita avadhana programme in the list. May be the poetry limited to the verses of Bhagavadgita. In the avadhana programmes as given in the web page, the verses are composed then and there. Anyhow very terrible achievement of human mind.
