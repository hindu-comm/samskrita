Sanskrit and Kannada avadhana programmes are organised fairly frequently in Bangalore. I went to one a couple of years ago and described it in an article here: <http://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2009/06/11/a-modern-day-ashtavadhanam/>

Dr Ganesh is I think acknowledged to be the best at least around here - and can face 100 questioners -but there are others who perform as well.
