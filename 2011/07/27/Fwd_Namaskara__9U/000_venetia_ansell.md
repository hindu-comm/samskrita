Hi everyone,

Some of you wanted to know about the book exhibition in Mysore this weekend, organised by Sudharma Sanskrit daily. The leaflet is attached. I can't read Kannada though so can't get any details save for those written in Devanagari. If anyone can read and summarise this I would be very grateful.

Best,

Venetia
