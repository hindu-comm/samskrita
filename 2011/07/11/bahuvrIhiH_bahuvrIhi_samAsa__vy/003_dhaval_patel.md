One more query:

In the followingdescriptionof dvipada bahuvrIhi, the text marked in red have laid down certain rules regarding the suffixes of bahuvrIhi.

I'm sure there must be an equivalent pANinIya rule. But as this text is not strictly according to pANinIya grammar, I would like to know according to which pANinIya rule, these rules are laid down in samAsachakram?
