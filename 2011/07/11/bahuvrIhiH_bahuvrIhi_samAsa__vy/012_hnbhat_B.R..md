Sorry I could not notice the odd member of the list. It should be पृथु and not पृथुलwhich makes it odd.

So also the first word उरु ending in short "u" (meaning large) to become eligible for including under this list.

  

The list could continue with all the adjectives you find words ending उ which could be used as such, मृदुः or मृद्वी with feminine suffix ई. The rule has been simplified collecting almost all the adjectives coming under this category. The adjective words ending in अ like शुक्ल, नील, itself take feminine ending आ, obligatorily as they denote the colour as well as used as adjectives as शुक्लः पटः, or शुक्ला पटी, शुक्लं रूपम्।



The correct translation of the sentence would be the adjectiveslisted wouldbe used with (feminine suffix) ई alsowhen used toqualify a noun in feminine gender (or otherwise they would be used as any feminine word ending in shortvowelउ), This makes in their declinations two fold forms, one with ending ई and the other ending उ.



In the case of other words substantive nouns ending with short vowel उ, they will take long ऊ when used denote feminine gender, with the exception animals, and some listed words like रज्जुः etc. But it is not considered here in this list. The result of operation of this rule, will beकुरुः (m) - कुरुः (f)- बन्धुः,ब्रह्मबन्धुः(m.) will take U, ब्रह्मबन्धूः, तनुः - तनूः (both feminine when meaning body),but when used as adjective, lean, तनुः , तन्वी बाला, etc. अलाबुः - अलाबूः, कर्कन्धुः - कर्कन्धूः, etc. Exception: रज्जुः, हनुः etc.



With regards
