4-1-44 वा उतो गुणवचनात् This Paninian rule explains the above, prescribing optionally feminine endings to the adjectives qualifying the attributes of things that end in उ. Almost all the words denoting qualities of things (used as adjectives) ending in उ come under this catagory and a selection of commonly used adjective is made above. More technical details about the word गुण attribute of things could be found in this link:

The adjectives ending in "i" will take no feminine suffix. शुचिः ब्राह्मणः or ब्राह्मणी. The exception is खरुः

|     |           |                                                                                                          | |----:|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |   1 | **kharu** | mfn. white L. ; foolish , idiotic Un2. ; harsh , cruel ib. ; desirous of improper or prohibited things L |

खरुः ब्राह्मणी. but गुरुः or गुर्वी पृथ्वी, which is popular by उर्वी as synonym also. as adjective उरुः, उर्वी शाला. large hall.

  

Hope this has clarified your doubt. Any other adjectives describing the attributes of things, ending in उ can be use as above, with or without feminine ending suffix to qualify words ending in feminine gender.
