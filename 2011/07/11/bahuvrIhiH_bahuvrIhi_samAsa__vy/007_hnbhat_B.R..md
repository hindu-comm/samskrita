(२) बहुपदो यथा – अधिकः उन्नतः संसो यस्य सः अधिकोन्नतांसः।  

Please not the typo error. If not corrected, please correct as अंसो



(३) सहपूर्वपदो यथा – सह कृष्णेन वर्तत इति सकृष्णः । सह पुत्रेण इति सपुत्रः। रामेण सह वर्तत इति सरामः।  

Even though there is no suffix for case ending, this compound with सह can be substituted with स optionally in बहुव्रीहि compound. Hence both forms are possible:



सहकृष्णः, सकृष्णः



according to the Paninianrule 6-3-82 वा उपसर्जनस्य.  



(४) संख्योत्तरपदो यथा – दशानां समीपे ये सन्ति,ते उपदशाः।  
  

(५) संख्योभयपदो यथा – द्वौ वा त्रयो वा द्वित्राः ।  

In the above cases, thenumerals denoting the countedobjects are added suffix in the compound.

5-4-73 बहुव्रीहौ सङ्ख्येये डजबहुगणात्

it takes they take समासान्त suffix डच् making the numerals ending in अ.

They are used in plural also always.



In the same way, एकद्वानि,पञ्चषाः, त्रिचतुरा, चतुष्पञ्चाःetc.।



(६) व्यतिहारलक्षणो यथा – केशेषु केशेषु गृहीत्वा इदम्‌ युद्धम्‌ प्रवृत्तम्‌ इति केशाकेशि युद्धम्।दण्दैर्डण्डैः कृत्वा इदम्‌ युद्ध‌ प्रवृत्तम्‌ इति दण्डादण्डि।मुसलामुसलि। etc.  
  
\> vyatihAralakShana bahuvrIhi – Difficult to translate in English. But in the present examples it means that the warriors fought catching each other’s hairs in the first example or they both fought with the stick in second example by the Paninian rule:  

2-2-27 तत्र तेन इदम् इति सरूपे  



More information on this compound and its meaning can be found in the commentaries on it:



<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/2-2-27.html>



The above describes the fighting, in which the weapons named in the compoundare used against each other.

and hence it takes the suffix in the compound इच् by the rule:



इच् कर्मव्यतीहारे (5,4.127) and it is considered as indeclinable adverb.



which is and it is inde

clinable too as an adverb as per .



Any clarification on the topics dealt with will be provided on demand.



Hope this all the case of समासान्त suffixes in the examples in the list.
