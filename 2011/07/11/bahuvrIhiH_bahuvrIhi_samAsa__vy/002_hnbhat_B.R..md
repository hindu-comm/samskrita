The more examples of the 4th type of Bahuvrihi, are covered in the above rule itself:

  

उपविंशाः। आसन्नदशाः। आसन्नविंशाः। अदूरदशाः। अदूरविंशाः। अधिकदशाः। अधिकविंशाः।

  

The first being collected with अव्यय, उप meaning समीपे , the total meaning nearly twenty. The same with other compounds with the other words in the rule. The last one in the list is again संख्या, which was described under the next item ५ as संख्योभयपद.

  

Any more comments will be added as I notice them.
