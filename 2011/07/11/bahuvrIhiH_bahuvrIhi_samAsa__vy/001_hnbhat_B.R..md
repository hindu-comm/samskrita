**2-2-25 सङ्ख्यया ऽव्ययाऽसन्नादूराधिकसङ्ख्याः सङ्ख्येये**

**The above compound is formed is explained as Bahuvrihi, as per the above rule, which forms the compounds with numerals used to denote the count of the things, like एकः, द्वौ etc. denoting the number of the counted qualifying it. The compound between formed with these numerals, with the above अ****व्यय,****आ****सन्न, अदूर, अधिक, and सङ्ख्या (numerals) are covered by this rule under bahuvrihi.**



The above example is for the bahuvrihi, between the two numerals, which covers the more examples of the type>

  

द्वित्राः, त्रिचतुराः, पञ्चषाः, etc. are commonly used, in the sense one or two, three or four, five or six respectively, showing the uncertainty of the total number of the counted between the two numbers. Others could also be formed. But for dvandva, these एक to चतुर् will make एकश्च एकश्च
- द्वौ and not एकौ as द्वन्द्व compound. But पञ्च च दश च - पञ्चदश, This is because they take the gender and number of the counted thing, but they have distinct numbers unlike those above five. Only after ten, you will get such एकादश etc. Before ten, पञ्च बालाः, दश ब्राह्मणाः etc.

  

Comments if any are welcome in this respect.
