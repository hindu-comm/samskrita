Many thanks to Shri Borwankar for giving his views on this subject

.

I can comment only on a few points. Against Nyam and Niyam, I have been taught

at my upanayanamceremony to pronounce it as Niyam. Also but for that the number of letters in that paada will be only 7 instead of 8.

  

Regarding Ni, Vaman Apte in his dictionary says "There are hardly any wordsin Sanskrit beginning with Na (ण) . Many roots which in the Dhatupatha are written with an initial Na really begin with na( न ). 
They are also written to show thatthe na is liable to be changed to Na when preceded by prepositions like pra, pari,

antar &c."

  

Regarding other points I leave them to more knowledgeable persons to comment.
