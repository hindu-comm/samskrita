Gayatri Ramayanam consists of 24 shlokas, the first of each shloka being one of the24 letters of Gayatri.  It is said that Ramayana contains 24,000 verses and the

first shloka of each of these 1000 verses begins with one of the 24 letters.

  

I have made a study of the printed Ramayana with me and I could find all the 24 shlokas mentioned above.

  

My nextexercisewas to find the total number of shlokas in the book I have. I find that thenumber was falling short by 138. The printed book with me also says that some of the chapters are prakshipta or added. 
The number of such verses come to145.  So there is a totaldeficiency of 283 verses to make a total 24,000.

  

At the end of each chapter it is mentioned "chaturvimsatisahasrikaayam" .

  

So it is clear that Valmiki's composition had 24,000 verses.Since the entire book was transmitted bymanual method for several generationsit is possible that some of the verses were lost.

  

As a matter of further information I furnish in the attached statement the 24 shlokas

and reference to Kanda-Sarga-Shloka as found in my book published by Panditha

Pusthakalaya, Kasi.
