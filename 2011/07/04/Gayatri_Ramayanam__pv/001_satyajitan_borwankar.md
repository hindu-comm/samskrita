Interesting.

However, a number of syllables only partially match the gaayatrii mantra. examples below:



tapassvAdyAya niratam tapasvI vAgvidAm varam \|

nAradam paripaprachCha vAlmIkirmunipunggavam \|\| 1 1-01-01 tat = ta



tuShTAvAsya tadA vamsham pravishya sa vishAmpatE: \|

shayanIyam narEndrasya tadAsAdya vyatiShData \|\| 4 2-15-20
tur = tu



nirIkShya sa muhUrtam tu dadarsha bharatO gurum \|

uTajE rAmamAsInam jaTAvalkala dhAriNam \|\| 7
2-99-25 Ni = Nyam ?



yadi buddhi: krutA draShTum agastyam tam mahAmunim \|

adyaiva gamanE buddhim rOchayasva mahAyasha: \|\| 8 3-11-44
yam



gachCha shIghramitO rAma sugrIvam tam mahAbalam \|

vayasyam tam kuru kShipram itO gatvAdya rAghava \|\| 10 3-72-17
go = ga



sa nirjitya purIm shrEShThAm langkAm tAm kAmarUpiNIm \|

vikramENa mahatEjA hanumAn kapisattama: \|\| 13
5-04-01 sya = sa

  
  
and so on.



So can one conclude that in the original raamaayaNa, there was a planned attempt to embed the gaayatree mantra?

or is this an afterthought of some scholar, who decided to search for the relevant syllables?



Moreover, the gaayatree mantra is said to be so sacred that no change in accent or intonation is allowed, much less in mutilating thesyllables

Satyajit
