Dear group,

There were several discussion about Uddanda Shastri recently on this group. I am doing a series of posts on his Kokila Sandesha (<http://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/kokila-sandesha-introduction/>) and have a question about a traditional story connected with him.

The story goes that he went to Taliparamba (in northern Kerala, about 20km from Kannur) and visited the Rajarajeshwara temple there. He was a worshipper of nirguna-brahman so wasn't in the habit of worshipping idols but he found his hands folding of their own accordinto a namaskara to the Shiva installed there and is meant to have said of the experience that his hands folded together as a lotus closes upon seeing the moon.

My question is - does anyone know the original Sanskrit verse that he is meant to have said? I would also be grateful for any further details you may know aboutthis story.

Thank you very much,

Venetia
