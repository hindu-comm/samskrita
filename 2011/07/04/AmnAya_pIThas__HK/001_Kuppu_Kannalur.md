Dear Arvind,



You have probably asked this question at the right time. Not sure if there is material available on the history and legacy of the Sankara mutts across the country. Am sure there are some material available at the Sankara Mutt,Kanchipuram, preserved in its university library, there are many manuscripts,and last i heard was that the mutt has taken the onus of digitising the manuscripts as a first step and there is also research going on. Leveraging technology in its current context is the best way to bring about collaborative research.



Just like the Tiruvananthapuram temple opening up to a treasure trove, am sure literary treasures are also available with these centuries old institutions. In India, we see history thro the eyes of British and reading, what they have left behind. but in truth, these are more corroborated than the actual truth. Only time and efforts of educated men can expose us to a secret past of India, the cradle of several civilisations.



regards

Kuppu
