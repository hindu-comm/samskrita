Dear All,



Namaste



i remember , when I joined this forum, someone shared the Sri Ranga Stotram. I really enjoy reciting the same, when time permits. However, I would like to clarify a doubt.



is it "ramatham mano me " or "smaratham mano me"



Attaching the stotram herewith.



Pl clarify. Many thanks

Kuppuswamy Sharma
