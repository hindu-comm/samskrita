I couldn't see any download link either

  

Probably, Google has some geographical block placed somewhere. (BTW I am accessing from India)

  

Anyways, I have found the book at [archive.org](http://archive.org) as well

  

(Most of the out of copyright Google books have a mirror at [archive.org](http://archive.org) as well )

  

<http://www.archive.org/details/standardsanskri00unkngoog>

  

Whilst the PDF link redirects to the Google Books page (again), the DJVU version is downloadable.

  

PFB the DJVU download link.

  

<http://ia700301.us.archive.org//load_djvu_applet.php?file=15/items/standardsanskri00unkngoog/standardsanskri00unkngoog.djvu>

  

I suppose the above will be downloadable to every one

  

Thanks
