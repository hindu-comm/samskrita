Shankara,  
  
I do not see any problem.  
  
I just a minute ago opened the relevant [books.google.com](http://books.google.com) page using  
the Tinyurl link. At the top are four links called 'Plain text',  
'Clip', 'Link', 'Feedback' and 'PDF'. The last one also has a  
downward arrow next to it, indicating 'Download'.
