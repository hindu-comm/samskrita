Kolhatkarji,

  

I think some Google books downloads are not allowed in Asian countries. I opened the same link using a proxy browsing site and I could see the download link at the top of the page as mentioned by you. (These links are not visible if one browses in normal mode in India). I could download the PDF of the dictionary.  

  

Thanks for the confirmation.  



regards  
shankara
