Dear Group,  
  
[books.google.com](http://books.google.com) holds the captioned dictionary at  
  
<http://books.google.com/books?id=xSUtAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sanskrit+English+Dictionary&hl=en&ei=Ob4uToE_huqBB9bbwHM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false>  
  
or <http://tinyurl.com/3om5yqk>  
  
It can be downloaded free in the pdf format, among others.  
  
I was not aware of it so far. Only MW and Apte dictionaries were used  
by me so far.  
  
The compiler claims that it is - to use the modern phrase - more user-  
friendly than MW. At the end there is a short chapter on prosody and  
another one on names that are met in Sanskrit literature.  
  
Interestingly, the digitalization has been made from a copy presented  
by the compiler to Charles Lanman, Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard,  
during his visit India. (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/>  
Charles_Rockwell_Lanman) as seen from the stamp at p.3/919. p.6/919  
has the compiler's presentation inscription and signature in English  
and a Sanskrit note:  
  
श्रमानुरूपं फलम्  
इति ज्ञायताम्  
इति XXX  
  
(I could not read the last three letters. Can someone help/guess?)
