PDF link works for me.  
  
Try this link directly  
  
<http://books.google.com/books/download/The_standard_Sanskrit_English_dictionary.pdf?id=xSUtAAAAYAAJ&output=pdf&sig=ACfU3U32oD20YjBLPUqukVkBdOdvyhslKQ>  
  
Though I prefer djvu format, much faster, smoother (and smaller size) compared to pdf.  
  
If pdf is still preferred, I prefer the free FoxIt Reader, which is faster than the regular Adobe Reader.
