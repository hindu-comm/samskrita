Neelesh,  

Thank you for your response. I was about to write again to the group to ignore my blabbering in previous mails.  

After some more thinking I realized that भ-संज्ञा happens only to स्वादि प्रत्यय which come only after प्रातिपदिक only ।  

  

I was doing some more search to clarify my doubts and you send the reply. can you please point out to origination of this सिद्धान्त  

क्विबन्ताः विजन्ताश्च प्रातिपदिकत्वं न जहति, धातुत्वमपि न मुञ्चन्ति ।
