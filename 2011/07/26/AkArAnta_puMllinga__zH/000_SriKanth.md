Respected scholars,

I thought there are no AAkaranta Pullinga words. However I came across  
in a book that गोपा, विश्वपा, सोमपा are masculine words ending with  
AA.

Is there any grammatical rule that says what are the general word  
endings for masculine, feminine and neutre.

Can there be अकारान्त स्त्रिलिङ्ग शब्द ?

dhanyavaada:  
Srikanth.
