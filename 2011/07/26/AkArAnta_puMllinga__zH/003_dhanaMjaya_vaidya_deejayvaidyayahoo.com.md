\> Can there be अकारान्त स्त्रिलिङ्ग शब्द ?  

No. If there is the opportunity to use अकारान्त word in स्त्रीलिङ्ग,  
it will take on a feminine ending.

I am glad that you have found these words, and now you no longer have  
the prior impression. A large class of आकारान्त पुंल्लिंग words are  
derived from आकारान्त verbs.  
विश्वपा = विश्व+पा = world-save(savior)  
शंखध्मा = शंख+ध्मा = conch-blow(blower)  
etc.  
There are also personal names which may end in आ, e.g. the gandharva  
whose name is हाहा

\> Is there any grammatical rule that says what are the general word

Thanks to Dr. HNB, who has given a detailed answer.
