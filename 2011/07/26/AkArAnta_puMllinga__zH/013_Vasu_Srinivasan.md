Not to go too much off topic, but Russian has only six cases (also the order is not same as in Sanskritam). As you said, in general the endings you gave apply, but there are quite a few exceptions. ya could be M, F or N. consonant ending could be N and M.  
  
There is no sambodhana case, also there is no separate for ablative and locative. But there is a "prepositional case" where prepositions are used with conjugations.  
  
Russian grammar is a "generously-simplified" version of Sanskrita grammar. (roots, prepositions, three mostly restricted-ending lingam-s, two vachanas and two verb conjugation types/ganas). But unlike Sanskrit, phonetics is largely influenced by "stress on vowels"
