Amba,  
  
Thanks for the link.  
  
Russian, being cognate with Sanskrit, has a similar structure, with  
the ending of the noun (generally) indicating the gender and with  
respective-gender related endings for them for the seven cases. M  
nouns usually end in a consonant, the F ones in aa or a consonant with  
a 'soft' sign (ь) after it and the N ones in o,e or ya. Thus you have  
(M) Алехей-Alexei, Павел-Pavel, отец-otyets (father), (F) сестра-  
sestra (sister), река-reka (river), Mосква-Moskva (Moscow), мать-matь  
(mother) etc. (In Алехей, the 'й', represented by 'i' in Roman, is a  
semi-consonant.)  
  
As with the Roman script, the Cyrillic too does not distinguish  
between a (अ) and aa (आ). Sanskrit राम is written as Рама (Rama) as in  
the Roman. However, the English language does not need to add endings  
to the noun to indicate the case, while the Russian language does.  
This has a curious outcome. M nouns of Sanskrit like राम are  
conjugated as if they were F, when used in the Russian, because they  
cannot conjugate 'a' ending nouns in the masculine gender. They do  
the same thing with 'a' ending masculine names like Nikita etc.
