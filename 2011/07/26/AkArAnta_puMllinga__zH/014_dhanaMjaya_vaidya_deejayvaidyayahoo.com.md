I agree that as Sanskrit is taught today (to all of us non-native  
speakers for ritual purposes), no influence of vowel stress is  
acknowledged. This is different from Sanskrit when it was spoken as a  
native language, or a language of early acquisition. (Descriptions by  
pANini and pata\~jjali , respectively.) Vowel stress of of utmost  
importance. In his book, pANini devotes much space to the influence of  
vowel stress in EVERYDAY spoken speech (not just vedic ritual, as some  
illiterate teachers lead us to believe).  
  
The learning of conjugation is much simpler if one pays attention to  
vowel stress. It only needs be known that the singular form final-  
terminations are unstressed, and the other terminations are stressed.  
Then all of the dizzying "strange irregularity" of vowel change  
becomes natural vocal production.  
kar'o'mi kurv'a'H kurm'a'H  
kar'o'Shi kuruth'a'H kuruth'a'  
kar'o'ti kurut'a'H kurv'a'nti  
  
The stressed vowels are marked in single quotes above. The location  
after the "kur" but before the end-syllable is -u/v- if unstressed and  
-o- if stressed. These changes happen euphonically, i.e., "naturally"  
by a feeling for the sound structure of the language. (No more mystery  
as to why the singular forms "asmi-asi-asti" retain the stressed  
beginning vowel 'a', while the rest of the conjugation, with the  
stress on the terminal, there is loss of the unstressed initial a- :  
"svaH-smaH-/-sthaH-stha-/-staH-santi")  
  
As a language to be used for ritual and not to be naturally acquired,  
the influence of vowel stress is no longer "natural". Memorization is  
necessary for the "weird" vowel changes during conjugation.
