Sorry, that I pressed send button before I could finish the message. By default, every word can be used in 3 genders (if participle), or otherwise in the masculine unless otherwise specified. There are suffixes forming from the corresponding word (if it is not already derived in specific gender) to form feminine markers. For example, अजः - अजा (he/she goad). Some are derived with specific genders: सम्पत्, विपत् etc. whereas some are used in masculine gender usually: इन्द्रजित्, etc. There is a compendium to अश्टाध्यायी compiled by the सिद्धान्तकौमुदी or so as लिङ्गानुशासनम् to serve as guide to the use of the genders so derived with Paninian rules or otherwise (underived) a digest of the rules regarding the genders in the derivational process. In कोश-s like अमरकोश too you will fine a section devoted for this purpose which appropriates the words by t heir gender and the related meanings used in different genders with different meanings.

  

Generally you will find the genders of the words noted in any standard modern Dictionary also which was served by लिङ्गानुशासनम् and नामलिङ्गानुशासनम् (traditional dictionaries). 

  

There are strange system of genders and numbers in Sanskrit usage.

  

The word गृह is used in neuter gender generally. as गृहम् - गृहे - गृहे - गृहाणि. But this is used in masculine gender also but invariably in plural:

  

गृहाः, गृहान् etc.

  

Similaryly, मित्रम् means friend in neuter gender, while सुहृत् is in masculine gender. But मित्रः used in masculine gender to denote the Sun deity.

  

Still more strange are the words meaning wife :

  

भार्या is in feminine, while कलत्रम् in neuter and दाराः is masculine gender (ending in "a") used always in plural like गृहाः.

  

The word अप्सरस् has been noted as being used in plural only in the feminine gender.

  

These peculiarities are noticed from the usages of these words and recorded by the lexicographers and there should not be anything in Grammar to govern these usages. These can be known from the कोश-s also.
