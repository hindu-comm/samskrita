Thank you  
**[श्रीमल्ललितालालितः](http://www.lalitaalaalitah.com/),  
  
The avadhAraraNA is mostly clear to me now.  
But I am still confused about the context in which iti is used in the first type (sambhAvanApUrvapada).  
I would be able to comprehend it better if you can provide English or Devanagari version,  
  
Thanking you,  
Dr. Dhaval Patel,
