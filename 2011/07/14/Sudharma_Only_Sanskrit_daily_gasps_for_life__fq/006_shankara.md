Namaste,

  

It is good that "Sudharma" is getting a lot of publicity as it completes 42 years. In fact it is not the only Sanskrit newspaper. May it is the oldest.  
  
Here is one more published from Gujarat - Samskrita Vartamana Patram at [http://www.sasnkritnewspaper.com](http://www.sasnkritnewspaper.com/)  

(yes notice the typo sasnkrit instead of sanskrit).

regards  
shankara
