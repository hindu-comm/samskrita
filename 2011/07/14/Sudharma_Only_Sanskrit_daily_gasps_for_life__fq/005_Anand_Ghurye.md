Dear Friends ,  
  
We are trying our level best to keep devabhasha from attaining swarga !  
  
Seriously , we need to see why we are at this stage . This is one of my favourite topics of experimentation . I believe that so far as we keep looking at Sanskrit as yet another language - great language , beautiful language , ancient language etc etc - but a language all the same it is bound to get less and less attention .  
  
Anything that does not have commercial utility is slowly discarded . Something that is not practised or used deteriorates . That is universal law .  
  
The fact is that Sanskrit has many many commercial uses which especially sanskrit scholars do not bring forth . We keep reiterating the grammatical rules and regulations endlessly paying least heed to Aadi Shankara advise .  
  
I use Sanskrit , not for speech but for day to day usage . I use Nirukta to reduce my dependence on memory or to make memorisation easier . I use Nyaya to remember gist of reports , presentations and books . I use shlokas to begin and end my speeches . The shlokas themselves have the whole of speech compressed within themselves . I try to understand new concepts in terms of Sanskrit . I study mathematics the way Aryabhata has given - with nice day to day examples . I am studying the way Sanskrit denotes high value numbers . I use Jyotish terminology in day to day matters . I use Jyotish structure of horoscope as an aid for mnemonics , remembering long passages , as a system to conceptualise , synthesize and analyse - all at the same time . There may be many many more uses which one needs to dig a little deeper and a little around for .  
  
Just think of it , in corporate training nearly 80 percent of training is around communication . If that is so , then how come such a powerful medium of communication is suffering ?  
  
Regards ,
