namo namaH!  
  
I recently came across this story of Kalidasa:  
  
There arose a question on who was the better poet: Kalidasa or Dandi? After realising that no Sanskrit scholar of their time was capable of evaluating their competence, the pair go to the goddess of knowledge, Saraswati. Upon being asked who was the greater poet, the goddess answers that it was Dandi. Disappointed, Kalidasa asks the goddess, "Am I nothing, mother?" A phrase well known to all students of Sanskrit is then uttered: "**tvamÄ“vaham**".  
  
Can anyone point out the original verse??
