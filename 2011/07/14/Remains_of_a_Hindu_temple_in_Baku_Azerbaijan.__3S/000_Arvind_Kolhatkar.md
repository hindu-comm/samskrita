Dear Group,  
  
I believe many would like to know about the remains of this little-  
known curiosity of a Hindu temple in Baku, Azerbaijan, called Ateshgah  
(Atesh + gah = fire-house). It was a temple devoted to the Goddess of  
Fire, like the famous Jwalamukhi Temple at Kangra. More information  
about the temple and of the several Sanskrit and Punjabi inscriptions  
in the temple may be seen at these sites:
