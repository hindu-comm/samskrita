**Dr,**

**“To be very frank, I have tried to translate it in English, but I don't know the meaning of the technical words 'ekavadbhAvI'** **and 'anekavadbhAvI' in the following sentenses...**

**Can any learned member throw light on them?”**



The most learned Sir Monier has this to say:

eka-vat

• ind. like one, simple.

• as one, as in the case of one, Āp. Pāṇ. &c. .

• -°d-bhāva m. the being or becoming like one, aggregation, Comm. on, KātyŚr. &c. \[229,1\]





As for **'anekavadbhAvI' –** can the Devanāgarī, be read as “not a collection taken as a whole (but as individual parts).”

“Aggregation” does not have an antonym in English.
