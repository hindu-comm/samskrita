The above is the explanation for एकवद् andएकवद्भावः  

given in वाचस्पत्य lexicon of वाचस्पति तारानाथ भट्टाचार्य which is a reliable source for Indian readers. According to the above source, the term means a function in Grammar, which carries the functions prescribed for a single number (noun) such as case-ending suffixes, agreement with verbs, gender etc.

In this case, it is prescribed for both द्विगु and द्वन्द्व compounds. Hence in the context of the text of a grammar, as the one in question, it would mean - एकवद्भावः अस्य अस्तीति - एकवद्भावी - the type of the compound carrying the function एकवद्भाव as described above. In this case it qualifies the noun द्विगु. The type which doesn't carry this function is न एकवद्भावी - अनेकवद्भावी द्विगुः.

i.e. carrying singular case-endings in all the cases and the type which carries the number according to the number of total members of the compound (singular, two and plural as the case may be).

  

In this case, the second variety of द्विगु is the designation of the group of seven sages popularly known as सप्तर्षि-s and this द्विगु is formed in this sense. Hence even though it is referring to the collection of the sages, it is intended to denote the individuals as well. Hence it is called अनेकवद्भावी. not carrying the function of a singular noun.
