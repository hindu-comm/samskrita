Dr,

 Thank you for the examples.



 It’s beginning to look like *dvigu* (द्विगु) and *dvandva* (द्वन्द्व) equate to ‘countable nouns’, which are also known as ‘count nouns, in English grammar. They contrast with ‘uncountable nouns’, otherwise known as ‘mass nouns’.



 *Ekavad* (एकवद्) on the other hand, comes into a different category of noun - ‘collective nouns’ / ‘aggregate nouns’.





When nouns are viewed, free of their syntactical case relationships with verbs, compounds gain a different category of identity.





Best wishes,



Eddie
