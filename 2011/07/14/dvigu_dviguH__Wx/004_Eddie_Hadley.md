Dr,



 There is an ambiguity here, that needs clarifying.



==>

Hence even though it is referring to the collection of the sages, it is intended to denote the individuals as well.

Hence it is called अनेकवद्भावी (anekavadbhāvī). not carrying the function of a singular noun.

\<==



As this reads, the words ‘as well’, being inclusive, attribute a double sense to the meaning of अनेकवद्भावी (as a grammatical term).



But surely the term is exclusive. Perhaps ‘instead’ is the appropriate adverb.



In such a context, a distinction needs be made between the observed and the observer.

The observed being that in front of the eye – whatever that may be, and the observer – he that experiences the whatever.

Does the observer see a forest of words (a singularity) or does he see words (a plurality).



He could of course be experiencing both, but the term (अनेकवद्भावी) would exclude that sense – requiring a term for an experience of a third (inclusive) kind.



I’m sure most observers have all three experiences.

In the later case we have a triplet, and the term may be ambiguous after all.



Eddie
