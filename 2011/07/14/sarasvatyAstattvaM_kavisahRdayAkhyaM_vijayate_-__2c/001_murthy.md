In this context two sloka's come to my mind although I do not know their origin:

त एव पदविन्यासाः ता एवार्थविभूतयः ।

तथापि काव्यं नव्यं स्यात् कवेर्ग्रथनकौशलात् ॥

अपारे काव्यसंसारे कविरेकः प्रजापतिः ।

यथास्मै रोचते विश्वं तथेदं परिवर्तते ॥

They are simple enough and perhaps do not need any commentary.

Regards

Murthy
