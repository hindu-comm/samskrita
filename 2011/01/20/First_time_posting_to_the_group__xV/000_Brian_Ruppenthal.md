Hello all,  

  

I am trying to identify a verse, and also solve a mystery about it, if possible. I hope someone here may take an interest in this matter, and offer suggestions.

  

S.I. Radhakrishnan quotes a verse in his book *The Bhagavadgītā*, as a footnote to his introductory essay, on page 64 of the G. Allen and Unwin, 1948 edition.

Radhakrishnan does not mention the source. Here is the verse as he shows it in this book:

  

rujāsu nāthaḥ paramaṃ hi bheṣajyaṃ

tamaḥ pradīpo viṣameṣu saṃkramaḥ \|

bhayeṣu rakṣā vyasaneṣu bandhavo 

bhavaty agādhe viṣayāṃbhasi plavaḥ \|\|

  

रुजासु नाथः परमं हि भेषज्यं  
तमः प्रदीपो विषमेषु संक्रमः \|  
भयेषु रक्षा व्यसनेषु बन्धवो   
भवत्यगाधे विषयांभसि प्लवः \|\|  

The meaning is clear enough:

  

*The Lord is the best remedy for any sickness, *

*a light in the darkness, a bridge across difficulties, *

*a protector against fears, a friend amidst troubles, *

*a boat to carry us across the deep sea of phenomenal existence.*  

  

I notice two problems. First, I wonder why 'tamaḥ' is in the nominative singular instead of locative singular, 'tamasi.' And next, 'bandhavaḥ' is properly a nominative, but in that form it is plural. It should thus be translated as 'friends.'  

  

Do you all -- anyone here who cares to wonder about it -- also find these two words problematic? Or does poetic license allow for such things, in your opinion?  

  

And now, the mystery...

  

I am hoping to identify where this verse comes from. By web searching I could only find it in the Radhakrishnan book, and also at the Sri Eknath Easwaran website, in a study guide, where the verse is shown essentially as Radhakrishnan has it and, like Radhakrishnan, with no literary citation. But I did find this strikingly similar verse, in a Nepali Buddhist work called the Kathinavādinā, only very recently (in 1990) published for the first time from microfilmed and transcribed copies of a palm-leaf manuscript:

  

puṇyaṃ narāṇāṃ tamasi pradīpo  
bhayeṣu rakṣā vyasaneṣu bandhuḥ \|  
rujāsu bhaiṣajyam anuttaraṃ ca  
plavaṃ ca saṃsāra-mahāsamudre \|\| kaṭhināvadāna 31.1\|\|  

  

  
पुण्यं नराणां तमसि प्रदीपो  
भयेषु रक्षा व्यसनेषु बन्धुः \|  
रुजासु भैषज्यम् अनुत्तरं च  
प्लवं च संसार-महासमुद्रे  \|\|  कठिनावदान ३१, १ \|\|  

  

Again, the translation looks simple enough:  

  

*The purity of humankind (is) a light in darkness, *

*protector in fears, friend in difficulties, *

*remedy in illness, and above all, *

*a boat (for crossing over) the great ocean of samsara.*  

  

Is it not remarkable that S.I. Radhakrishnan would know and quote a verse he could not identify the source for, which so resembles something from a highly obscure Buddhist text? Can anyone think of how this might be -- and better yet, can anyone identify what source the Radhakrishnan quote comes from?  

  

Thank you very much for reading this, if you have gotten so far as to see my closing words here,  

  

Brian
