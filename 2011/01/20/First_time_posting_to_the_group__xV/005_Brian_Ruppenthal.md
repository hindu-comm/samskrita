Friends,  

  

The two answers I got here, about the verse from Radhakrishnan, both helped considerably.

  

ToNaresh Keerthi, and regarding tamaH-prdIpO: your suggestion, which Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat also gave, clearly solves the conundrum. Evidently Radhakrishnan's typesetter separated the compound into two words, instead of leaving it as a compound. In that sense, it is but a printer's devil.

  

And now, a bit embarrassingly, it turns out I am the one who introduced the spelling error on bAndhavah, which I typed in asbandhavah. Neither Radhakrishnan nor his typesetter did this!

  

To Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat B.R., I offer thanks for your in-depth opinions on this verse. It does seem likely, as you say, that Radhakrishnan simply got the verse somewhere without adequate attribution. But he liked the verse and so he used it, to help illustrate a point.

  

I particularly appreciate your insights into नाथः, and your guess as to a single Prakrit source for the two versions of this verse:

  

*Anyhow, in the first case it the word नाथः is the distinguishing word from  
the second verse and to deduce from the second source, both seem to belong  
to be some stotra in praise of any of the naatha-s of the नाथ sampradaya of  
Tibetian Buddhism. Thus both are addressed to the नाथ and both have this  
fact in common. It is purely अनुहरण of one of them (whichever may be the  
first in chronology.). This is just a guess by the specific word नाथः  
separated from all the common metaphoric phrases. In the second, all the  
phrases are metaphors with the qualified noun in the verse (which is to be  
continued with the preceding verse taken from some verses back) and  
obviously it is not in the verse you have quoted. Now the metaphors are  
almost corresponding.  
*

*...  
*

*Probability is that both are two independent translations of original Stotra  
in Prakrit addressed to the Naatha (followers of Hatha Yoga).*

  
  

Thanks,

Brian
