I have no pretensions to scholarship, but here is my attempt at explaining these -  
  
I apologise for using the Harvard-Kyoto transliteration scheme, and nmot the nAgarI font, or diacritical marks.  
  
1. tamaH-pradIpO should be taken a single word ,as a samAsa, of the SaSTI tatpuruSa kind. This resolves the need for a declension.  
  
  
2. the troublesome word could be read as b***A***ndhavO instead of b***a***ndhavO. The word bAndhavah is a taddhita formed out of bandhu, and can transmute, suitably to bAndhavO.  
  
Hope this helps.
