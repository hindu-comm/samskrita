Frankly speaking, I could not think about any answer to your query about the source of the verse quoted by Radhakrishnan. Probably he might have taken from some other source where it is quoted, without acknowledging the source (may be not enough details to identify bibliographical details).

  

Anyhow, in the first case it the word नाथः is the distinguishing word from the second verse and to deduce from the second source, both seem to belong to be some stotra in praise of any of the naatha-s of the नाथ sampradaya of Tibetian Buddhism. Thus both are addressed to the नाथ and both have this fact in common. It is purely अनुहरण of one of them (whichever may be the first in chronology.). This is just a guess by the specific word नाथः separated from all the common metaphoric phrases. In the second, all the phrases are metaphors with the qualified noun in the verse (which is to be continued with the preceding verse taken from some verses back) and obviously it is not in the verse you have quoted. Now the metaphors are almost corresponding.

  

And, your problem with the words तमःप्रदीपः is exactly a transformed compound form of the metaphoric phrase तमसि प्रदीपः in the second verse first paada. The word बन्धवः in the first verse, if taken as typo error, for बान्धवः, it is in singular and correspond exactly the expression व्यसनेषु बन्धुः \| in the second line of the second verse and can be translated similarly (without any change in meaning). The remaining difference is simply बिषयाम्भसि प्लवः =प्लवं च संसार-महासमुद्रे\|

  

Probability is that both are two independent translations of original Stotra in Prakrit addressed to the Naatha (followers of Hatha Yoga).

  

Hope some member would be able to locate the source for the verse. I hope this would be helpful to solve the problem with the words in the first verse.
