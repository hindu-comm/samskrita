Namo namaha abhyanakar Mahodaya,  
  
I request you to kindly guide me through the samskrita samasas found in the NamaRamayana stotra..through all the seven kandas. Certain samasas are beyond my comprehension, though the general meaning is clear. I plan to teach in to my students , before which i wish to clarify my own doubts.  
Would be extremely grateful if you could guide me in the same..  
  
savineetam,  
Srivalli Anand
