*समः समविभक्ताङ्गः*स्निग्धवर्णः प्रतापवान् । पीनवक्षा विशालाक्षो लक्ष्मीवान् शुभलक्षणः ।। 1.1.11

  

The above is the usage you had quoted in Ramayana. To put literally into a parallel from symmetrical would be closer to the adjective समविभक्त. and you can translate it as well defined, proportionate too.

  

In hindi, they use संविभक्त too in the same sense:

  

*संविभक्त*, वि० \[सम्-वि√भज् (देना)+क्त\] १. अच्छी तरह बँधा हुआ। २. ठीक और सुंदर बना हुआ। सुडौल

  

That too may be taken and modified to suit your need symmetrical or symmetry संविभक्तता।

  

These two only occurred to my mind also. but was watching the replies to your querry.

  

You are right and even within a language itself, there are no exactly synonymous words, butparallel usages in the similar meanings. How to seek a closer word in an alien language which has different habits and grammar structure of its own? Hope some word may come up.

  

With regards
