Thanks. But I am afraid the words are not equivalent to "symmetry". "roopasaMhananam" is a word often used by Valmiki. It conveys "with proportionate parts" or "well balanced". "angasaMhati" is cognate. But "prakramabhanga" seems to convey the very opposite.(prakrama=order,bhanga=break)? "suvibhaktataa" is again more near to being "proportionate" which also occurs in Valmiki. "sammaa" is perhaps "simllar" (sam+maa)? " avaiShamya" conveys many things.I would imagine there would be a suitable word used in SilpaSaastra. Quite possibly a generic word would have been used as a technical term with the specific meaning of "symmetry" just as "guNa" is used for "multiply" in mathematics.

Regards

Murthy
