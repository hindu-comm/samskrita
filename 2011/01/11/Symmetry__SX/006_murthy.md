Dear All,  
Many thanks for suggestions regarding an equvalent to the word "symmetry".  
"suvibhaktataa" occurs in Valmiki: "samaH suvibhaktaangaH",  
"suvibhaktamahaapathaH". I quote from memory and I think former refers to  
Srirama and the latter to Ayodhya. It does not appear that Valmiki wants to  
convey "symmetry" in the former although "symmetry" may not be ruled out as  
a possible meaning for the latter.  
"samamiti" is indeed a good coined word. I am not aware how old the word  
"symmetry" is. I believe the word I have been toying with "svasaamyam"  
captures the essence of symmetry.  
I have been looking for an instance where "symmetry" is the most appropriate  
meaning for a Sanskrit word used. I would not like to believe that concept  
of symmetry is alien to "Sanskrit" and allied languages knowing that temple  
architecture abounds in symmetry.  
Regards  
Murthy
