Dear friend.

  

It is the popular lexicon of Amarasimha नामलिङ्गानुशासनम्। There are many more lexicons of the same and different themes of which त्रिकाण्डशेष is a compendium supplementary to those listed by Amara and another by Sriharsha अमरखण्डनम् criticizing the categorization of Amara by way of which he himself includes many other quotations from a wide range of Lexicons. Only Amara is popular for his way of treatment of synonyms.

  

For each of the listed words, usages can be shown.  

  

Thanks
