Dear Jay Mahodaya

In that mantra every single line has a synonym for the sun or the sun personified as the deity Surya, either as a single word or as a bahuvRH, eg padmahasta – one holding a lotus (reference to Surya the sun diety); he is depicted as holding two lotuses on either hand, or sahasra kiranAya – one having a thousand rays. Of course it is all in dative case, sing, masc, as he is being invoked.

Vimala
