The following are synonyms for प्रकाश :

  

स्युः प्रभा रुग् रुचिस् त्विड्-भा-भाश्-छवि-द्युति-दीप्तयः ॥३६॥  
रोचिः शोचिर् उभे क्लीबे प्रकाशो द्योत आतपः ।३७ ॥

  

Why to strive for too many choices? And by virtue of the flexibility and extension of shades of meaning, all the words have specific usages and there are no exactly synonyms even within any single language. Hence all the words are used with different shades of meaning and only choice only remains within the range of available approximate closeness of meanings with another language in the case of translation. It holds good in either Sanskrit to English or vice verca. Why to strive for Sanskrit exact equivalents when a wide range of words and synonyms are available? Each word could be traced back to Vedic literature with the same or a different meaning. In Surya Sahasranama or any Stotra-s in praise of Surya, one can find many more synonyms of प्रकाश.

  

I was just watching the replies.
