Dear Jay Mahodaya

No, bhASa is a from a different root. The meaning of that line is something like: What language would be used to describe a stithaprajNa? In other words – How do you describe such a person? What words or phrases would be used to describe him? The root bhA (to shine) is Vedic (a older form) and the gItA uses classical Sanskrit, so its language is easier to follow.
