I am sure you will get many words for light from the learned  
participants. Sure some will go as back as Nirukta. But small start from  
me..

काश itself means light and that is why Kashi (Name of Varanasi city  
known as center of knowledge - as source of light) and commentaries are  
known as Kasika- one that throws light.
