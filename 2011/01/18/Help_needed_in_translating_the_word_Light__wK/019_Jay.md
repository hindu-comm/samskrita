Bhat Mahodaya,  
  
One question. Can Bha be etymologically connected with BhaSHa as well? I know Language is only narrowly read meaning of BhaSHa.  
BhagvadGita 2nd Adhyaya Arjun asks- -Sthitapragnasya Ka BhaSHa Samadhisthsya Keshav  
  
Apart from Kashi, Lord Shiva -knowledge and light have yet another similar connection. Somnath is in town Prabhas Patan. Lord Shiva's sthan is source of light, be it Kashi or Prabhas.
