भाषा is not related with भा in any way, but it is independently derived of the verb:

  
**भाषव्यक्तायां वाचि।**



meaning = to speak; And, in the above context,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
Arjuna learned at about four things asked of them is so widespread that after the first Peashn Antarrhao the three questions is it.The terms of the end of the chapter-long the same question, but the other three questions must understand this distinction to explain the now two verses in the "How Sthithprjrञ speaks' or how (when) he is called स्थितप्रज्ञ  
  

The answer makes the intention clear of the word भाषा (भाष्यते इति भाषा)

  
.. ... स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते .. 55 ..

  
Arjuna, when one thoroughly dismisses all cravings of the mind, and is satisfied in the self through (the joy of) the self, then he is called stable of mind. (55)

  

About the pilgrim places of India, many such derivations can be found related. But in one way or other they are connected with the legends glorifying them either क्षेत्र or तीर्थ to be found in the numerous mass of Purana literature. They may or may not have some explanation in the etymology (rarely) of the words. Mostly the context is the deciding factor of the meaning than the ones derived with etymology (some time may support the popular belief and some times not so) in these cases. This is my own opinion.
