Yes. Amarakosha as it properly known by the name of its compiler Amarasimha. a.k.a नामलिङानुशासनम् distinguishing its function than the present day dictionary. It helps to build in the vocabulary of Sanskrit too, when it is properly used to serve its purpose in addition to a basic knowledge of Grammar acquired by a learner.
