Thank you Vimalaji for the translation which seems to be satisfactory too in my opinion. I had collected 4 or 5 Translations from different writers and Yoga-practitioners.

  

For grammatical analysis I have found one more reason why the compound does not come within the jurisdiction of the rule of Panini quoted by Sri Vaidya. It is not at all क्तान्त as required by the ruele क्तेन नञ्विशिष्टेनानञ् . The adjective क्लिष्ट is explained as क्लेश itself a क्तान्त denoting action क्लेश by the rule नपुंसके भावे क्तः(Pāṇini III.3.114)। and further it is secondarily derived as having क्लिष्ट - क्लिष्टम् आसामस्तीति क्लिष्टाः - क्लिष्टाः = क्लेशेनाक्रान्ताः which is precisely translated in the translation provided by you. अविद्यास्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः (III.3)

अविद्यास्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः पञ्च क्लेशाः॥३॥

Avidyāsmitārāgadveṣābhiniveśāḥ pañca kleśāḥ//3//^([\[19\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kle%C5%9B%C4%81_(Buddhism)#cite_note-patanjali-18))

This may be rendered in English as:

> -   Ignorance (in the form of a misapprehension about Reality) >     (avidyā), > -   egoism (in the form of an erroneous identification of the Self >     with the intellect) (asmitā), > -   attachment (rāga), > -   aversion (dveṣa) and > -   fear of death (which is derived from clinging ignorantly to life) >     (abhiniveśa) >
> are the five (pañca) Kleśa-s or Afflictions (kleśāḥ)//3//^([\[19\]  
>   
> ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kle%C5%9B%C4%81_(Buddhism)#cite_note-patanjali-18))

The above is the translation of the above Sutra given in the reference cited.

  

Again The भाष्य explains both the terms in unambiguous terms: क्लेशहेतुकाः कर्माशयप्रचये क्षेत्रीभूता क्लिष्टाः, ख्यातिविषयाः गुणाधिकारविरोधिन्यो ऽप्यक्लिष्टाः, क्लिष्टमध्यपतिता अप्यक्लिष्टाः ..... etc. Those वृत्ति-s caused by or fertile ground for causing and the accumulation कर्म (शुक्लाशुक्ल) are क्लिष्ट-s. Those having leading to or originated by the realization of separateness (of सत्त्व and पुरुष) are अक्लिष्ट् . and so on.

  

This Sutra is quoted in the article on Buddhism in Vikepedia. for comparison of the concepts क्लेश.
