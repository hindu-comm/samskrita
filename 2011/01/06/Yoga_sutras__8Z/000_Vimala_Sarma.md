Dear Eddie Mahodaya

This is the way Charles Johnston has translated Patanjali’s yoga sUtras. See:

<http://oaks.nvg.org/sa1ra4.html>

The psychic activities are five; they are either subject or not subject to the [five hindrances](http://oaks.nvg.org/sa1ra4.html#2)\] (see Book 2, verse 3). \[1:5\]

Through perfectly concentrated Meditation \[sanyama\] on the three stages of development comes a knowledge of past and future. \[3:16\]

As you can see, these these kliSTas are specific things, and also the three stages of development of meditation.

Sankara’s bhASya of brahmasUtras may not be relevant as that is different school of philosophy. He is an Advaitin and everything will be interpreted from this perspective, his is opposed to both Buddhism and the dualism in SAnkhya – puruSa and prakRitUI being separate.

I think I will leave this thread now as I have no more to add that is useful.

Warm regards.
