All,  
Re: Patañjali III. 16 Pariṇāma-traya-saṃyamāt atīta-anāgata-jñānam iti  
and its troublesome samāsa.

Your replies are worthy of some consideration.  
I thank you for the information, for It is clear from your replies, that  
they are considered replies - anumāna.

Your answers confirm my own tentative understanding that the sūtra states  
the objective of the particular mental exercise (III. 16) is to obtain, two  
distinct types of knowledge.  
The atīta-anāgata, not being the one range, delineated by the two borders,  
but two mutually exclusive states - the jñānam, being singular, also ruling  
out a dual occurrence.  
The notion is thence formed, that this knowledge is of the nature of that  
achieved by the crystal gazer, who gazing into her crystal ball, and  
utilizing some mysterious organ of sense, conjures up a scene from the  
distant future.  
And that here, where we are that gazer, that crystal being this inner sphere  
that is realm of this inner organ - manas.  
This notion however, bringing in its wake, much doubt as to whether this  
instrument our ours is actually capable of such super normal feats, leads  
many to dismiss the possibility out of hand, and to not bother to  
investigate any further, let alone to actually undertake an such attempt.

Such categorizing of these sūtra, and those of the entire work as that of a  
treatise of a paranormal nature, has its consequences.  
It discourages the further anumāna by being seen as an unworthy enterprise,  
and somewhat inhibits pratyakṣa.

However, even a little pratyakṣa, on the work itself, let alone on that to  
which the work refers, raises some interesting questions.  
The particular sūtra, being understood as being an objective, has the  
preceding sūtra (III. 13 - III 15), understood as detailing the process by  
which that aforementioned end is achieved.  
Those preceding details, aka instructions - anuśāsana, may be deserving of a  
little pratyakṣa, if only to confirm this impression.  
In other words, it might pay to take a look at the work as it is, before our  
own eyes, rather than through the eyes of others.  
Input from these others, numerous and weighty as they may be, greatly  
influences the form that our notion takes, given that's all the information  
(only III- 16) we go on.  
In so doing, even a cursory perusal of just the initial step (III-13) in  
this particular process is quite revealing.

Patañjali III. 13 Etena bhūta-indriyeṣu dharma-lakṣaṇa-avasthā-pariṇāmāḥ  
vyākhyātāḥ.

bhūta - that which exists, is happening, present, real.  
indriyeṣu - experiences located in (/obtained via) the sense organs - just  
those five sense organs as we know them, dubious other senses reputed to be  
possesses by crystal gazers hereby explicitly excluded.  
dharma-lakṣaṇa-avasthā -three, continuously evolving - pariṇāmāḥ,  
categories that can be attributed to any and all material matter, be it  
animal, vegetable or mineral:

dharma - the particular nature of such particular existence; that of  
water, differing from that of hydrochloric acid, a cat's from a dog's, a  
particular cat's nature from that even of its' twin sibling.  
lakṣaṇa - the dynamic signs of the direction that such existence may  
take, even as we watch;  
movement - as of the matter through its space,  
changes - as of the matter through time.  
In the outer world, these two are inseparable.  
Clues to the what is yet to be, perhaps?  
avasthā - its environment- every existence has a some-where and a  
some-when – which is not unknown for influencing lakṣaṇa.

Indeed, all three are inseparable, mutually influencing the other.  
In essence then, the dynamic trio accompanying any-thing and every-thing  
that is a something and not a nothing (a no-thing).

Each and every some-thing, past present or future has each and every one of  
these three inseparables. Do they not?

I would say then, that we are hereby being anchored very much in the natural  
world - the domain wherein dwells our farmer, his water flowing very much  
under the influence of natural forces.  
That's what my eyes tell me.

  
Gentlemen, you may understand that the alternative interpretation, derived  
as it is from words, does not hold up very well, when viewed against the  
understanding derived from the eyes.  
Surely 'I see!' as by the inner organ, is very much influenced by the 'I  
see' as from the outer organ, and not the other way around as some  
interpretations lead us believe.

Grammarians may now feel that a return to the drawing board is in order,  
while ontologists may confidently continue refining their working model  
according to this 2,000 year old blueprint that is the YS.

To explain the discrepancy in the interpretations, I would propose, that  
this blueprint was drawn with the most technically advanced tool of the  
day - Sanskrit – only to suffer many dignities thru the ages.

Indignities perpetrated by innumerable commentators - who, very much from  
the academic world (of the grammarian kind) it would seem - that may be seen  
to have been somewhat over-zealous in their embroidery work.  
So tightly woven into the original fabric of this material, is their  
colourful needlework, as to almost completely obscure the existence of the  
native thread. Almost.
