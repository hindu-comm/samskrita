All,  
  
A quick note re problems some members are experiencing with message  
corruption.  
The situation requires proper investigation, but it appears to be  
limited to Gmail client e-mail (my Windows Live e-mail client, for  
example, does not have this problem.)  
  
For now, from the Gmail support group:  
  
\<==  
Non-Latin characters can corrupt message headers  
. . .  
Several issues can result from corrupt message headers, including  
delivery problems.  
The Gmail Team is working to resolve this issue.  
  
\<==  
  
For now, I have changed the one ‘Non-Latin’ character in the above  
Subject Line . . .  
and posted via [googlemail.com](http://googlemail.com) as opposed to via my usual Window Live  
mailer  
so lets see if the mysterious problem evaporates . . .  
  
  
To continue:  
  
So, to Vimala, who replies “because things are either one or the  
other”.  
  
Indeed they are, but neither of the two examples I have a problem with  
are ‘things’ in the sense of i.e. entities – entire things - they are  
both properties -of- things.  
To make things clear, ‘trouble’ is not a thing, it’s a state, and vary  
some by nature.  
  
Early in the day, for example,a particular situation may appear as  
opportunity, a challenge, ‘no problem – a pleasure’.  
As the day wears on, my condition, my enthusiasm for ‘challenging  
situations’ waning somewhat. The very same aforementioned particular  
situation becomes ‘a problem – not a pleasure’. Throughout such a day,  
my ‘no trouble’ state, unperceptively shades into ‘trouble’.  
  
  
Again, on the scale of difficulty, ranging from easy to hard, the  
resolution of this problem, to me, is off the scale, outside my  
capability altogether i.e. impossible!  
Perhaps the scale would then need to be extended to encompass  
‘impossibly difficult’ ‘effortless to handle – impossible’.  
  
And again, to put it rather grandly:  
Deferring to the ‘Teacher, even of the Ancients’, very much present,  
as is everlasting - I hear him tell (present tense) ‘the past has a  
bearing on the future’, ‘the past shades into the present and on into  
the future’.  
  
Deferring to the grammarian, very much not present, long since  
outlasted – hear he said (past tense) otherwise.  
With the grammarians, I have a problem in understanding when ‘the  
past’ ends, when ‘the present’ begin, and where the dividing line is  
between ‘the present’ and ‘the future’.  
  
These are two opposing ‘views’ of what is surely the one and the same  
space-time continuum.  
Grandly or not be a resolution, a resolution of any grade of grandness  
would do for this questing soul.

as yet I haven't a @Gmail.com ID, from where complaints of missing  
content are coming from. . .
