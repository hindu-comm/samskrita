All,

Am I to understand that, by gazing rather intently at an earthenware  
pot, I get to see in my minds eye, the potter at his wheel shaping that  
clay, hundreds of years ago?  
And then, moments later, I get to see, in the same minds eye, an  
archaeologist in very futuristic attire, arranging broken bits of pottery  
into a pot shape?

Or is it that I am to pay close attention to a lump of wet clay being  
shaped by a potter, being placed in an oven, etc. thereby getting to  
understand how to make better pots?

Specifically, is the YS a treatise on the development of supernatural  
abilities of the mind, or on the development natural abilities - of the  
mind?

The mind, being a powerful resource, born running around untamed, is to  
be put under the yoke. The power so harnessed, to be employed, or not  
employed, at will.  
And not running wild, getting into (and out of) all sorts of trouble.

Now, in this work, the man himself uses the term śakti, very much as an  
attribute of the mind. He doesn't say soul (a viśeṣya or a guṇa?). The  
commentators do that, through tradition perhaps, but without justification.

The past, the future, not to mention the present are states of being,  
are they not? They attributes not entities. Time-space-matter-energy is the  
everlasting entity.

We can all have these supernatural experiences, not by means of  
developing a mysterious extra sense, but by turning off all activities  
(vṛtti) of an existing one, the inner critical facility otherwise known as  
the mind (citta). Temporarily.

I've made that humming sound. I've been there. I've seen the useable. It's  
for real. And it's not an uncommon experience for many.

There is now the small matter of the vṛtti. Like the farmer, I need to know  
when and how to allow the water to flow. When and how not to allow the water  
to flow.

It's all there. The saṃ-skṛti. Is it not?

So, does the team think that the YS is treatise on the development of  
supernatural abilities of the mind, or on the development natural abilities  
of the mind?  
- or what?
