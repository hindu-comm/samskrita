###  Introducing a comparatively newer Sanskrit work by shrI sha\~Nkara chaitanya bhAratI dealing with viGYAnavAda, shUnyavAda, svAtantryavAda and advaitavAda. Four chapters, one dedicated to each. Later refutes earlier and the culmination is in advaitavAda. Useful for bauddhas, kAshmIra-shaivites and vedAntins. Language is somewhat like gauDabrahmAnanda. So, don't expect it easy to digest.  A prakaraNam of vedAnta presented in a new way.
