Kiran – Ji

These cases you cited the noun is declined ie nom (1^(st) vibhakti), mas, sing form of namas.

And the compound form of the noun is namo- eg namo, namovAka (an uttering of salutation).



Nam is also a verb root Class 1, Parasmai, to bow – namati, eg sirasA namAmi, and so you can get the absolutive praNamya, and all other conjugations etc.
