Dear Ramji,

  

Ram Ram. There is no doubt about नम् (णम प्रह्वीभावे = to bow) being a verb. But the issue was whether the word नमस् is a neuter gender orindeclinable अव्यय. And too there are many ways of expressing salutations in Sanskrit than one in question.

  

नमस्यामो देवान्, नमामि त्वाम्, प्रणमामि त्वाम्, नमस्ते, नम उक्तिं विधेम, नमो ऽस्तु ते व्यास विशालबुद्धे, नमोवाकं प्रशास्महे all derived from the root नम् = to salute to convey salutation.

  

According to Monier Williams only it is considered as Neuter Gender. But according to Indian Grammarians and lexicographers it is considered as indeclinable. That was the point in question raised by Sri Aravindji.

  

I had already answered it in clear terms and could not find any source from Indian Grammar to defend it being a noun neuter gender in lexicons and grammar. You are right in your assertion as it is a popular thing for anybody knowing Sanskrit Grammar. It is considered so by Paninian system of Grammar as अव्यय by including it in the list of them provided in the rule1-1-37स्वरादिनिपातमव्ययम्॥ and none of the commentators ever remarked as it being noun too.

  

Only case government is discussed and its derivates too. 2-3-16नमःस्वस्तिस्वाहास्वधालंवषड्योगाच्च । governs dative case with the word to whom salutation is intended to be conveyed. नमस्कुर्मो नृसिंहाय, नमस्कृत्य मुनित्रयम्, etc. usages are there with the same word. स्वयंभुवे नमस्कृत्य is also available attested. The following words are derived from the same word: namas\_

नमस्यति = worships, नमस्या = worship. 

  

All the lexicographers consider it as अव्यय. One commentator on Amarakosha had remarked: अनव्ययमस्ति नमश्शब्दः। and supports his statement by citing examples:

  

"यत्तन्नमः किमपि शुश्रुम देवताभ्यः" "त्वामन्तरेण नमसामवसानभूमिम्।" (Source not known).

(अमरकोशपारिजातः)।

  

Either the rarely occurring forms may be considered as exceptional and archaic accepting the authority of Indian tradition, or accept them as regular usages ignoring the Paninian tradition following western opinion. Choice is yours.

  

This is my reflection on seeing the messages in this thread from different angles.
