May I attempt to answer your प्रश्नः  
The singular person number of 'Greetings (honor) to you' can be either नमस्ते or नमस्तुभ्यम् । The latter is what I greet my Indian wife of 32 years.  
The dual (i.e. the number that addresses two people only!) can be either be नमो युवाभ्याम् or नमो वाम् । Note: If I have only TWO students in a class, then this is how I would greet them.  
The plural number (i.e. more than two people) would be नमो युष्मभ्यम् or वः ।  
Scholarly members: please correct any दोषाः that I may have made.

Namaste!  
Could you help me solve a little doubt?  

How do you say, in Sanskrit, namaste, when referring to (greeting) more than one person?  

Is it the same word or different?  
Thanks :)
