The only condition governing the proximity of the word नमस् is the word associated with denoting the person/deity/thing should be declined in the dative case ending. And it is a general rule, that Sanskrit words are declined according to the numbers with they correspond, singular, duel or plural. So it is not any special case if it is a word in the association with नमस्. (which to can take duel or plural forms). Only the agreement with the numbers it represents is a must (if it is an inflected noun.).  

  

So if you intend many salutations you can use नमांसि, (to show only higher degree of respect) which doesn't differ in meaning and also use the plural if you intend it to be conveyed to more than one persons. But use युबाभ्यां/वां नमः or युष्मभ्यं/वो नमः। तुभ्यं नमः, भवते नमः, भवद्भ्यां नमः, भवद्भ्यो नमः all these could be used to greet another person. = meaning only I salute you.
