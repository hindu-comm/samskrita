Benjwal,  
  
For Vedic signs, and for data entry (typing) etc., you might want to  
explore BablePad and its included BabelMap (see below).  
  
As its name suggests, it's somewhat overkill for your purposes, but it  
does give all those Vedic signs that you need.  
  
As well as Unicode it accepts ASCII encodings - and convertion to and  
from legacy (ASCII) and Unicode (UTF-8) encoding schemes.  
  
Other Indic scripts are included.  
  
Text can be saved as graphics . . .  
  
And its free.
