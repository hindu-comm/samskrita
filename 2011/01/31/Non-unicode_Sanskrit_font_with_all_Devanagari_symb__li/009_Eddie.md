Benjwal,  
  
  
It would appear that Photoshop does indeed support unicode characters.  
There is a (long) discussion on this matter (viz.Tamil text) which may  
be of interest: <http://forums.adobe.com/thread/544712>  
  
Put basically, you install the required unicode font, then type in the  
full unicode code point as a number.  
  
U+0946 DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN SHORT E  
U+094A DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN SHORT O  
  
  
Which approach you use depends on how much typing is involved, I  
suppose - if it's not too much, perhaps an expert can do a quick job  
for you.  
  
Best wishes,  
  
Eddie,
