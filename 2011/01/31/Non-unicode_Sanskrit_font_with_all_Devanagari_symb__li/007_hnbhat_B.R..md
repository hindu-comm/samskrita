Chandas fonts should provide the vedic symbols.

Samples of fonts are here:

Yourself can verify whether they are suitable for your purpose.

  

In Itrans too I have found the vedic symbols, but they do not have unicode support (for some).

  

Baraha IME has also got the following encoding for in put:

  

@ = … *(anudatta)*

# = † *(udatta)*

$ = ‡ *(swarita)*

#f1; = ñ *(gu)*

#f2; = ò *(ggu)*

#f3; = ó *(gM)*

#f3;#e8;= óè *(gM)*

*which is meant for typing in any page.*

*  
*

*The Baraha IME can be stand alone application can be downloaded from this rapidshare link:*

*  
*

*  
*

*[Baraha_IME.zip](http://rapidshare.com/files/109344208/Baraha_IME.zip)  
*

  

Hope it can be used in Photo shop too. I have not tried.
