No dotted circle is not important. I could not find following symbols in its character map,  
**ऒ, ॊ, ऎ, ॆ, ॒, ॑** (rest are there)**  
**Are above symbols included in the font? For the first four only **ॆ** is sufficient, it can be appended to **आ** to form **ऒ**, with **ा** to form **ॊ**, with **ए** to form **ऎ**  
  
Also is there any IME (Input Method Editor) available for this font? Without that typing is difficult.
