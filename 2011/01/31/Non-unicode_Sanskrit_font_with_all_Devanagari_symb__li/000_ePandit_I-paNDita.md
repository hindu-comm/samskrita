Respected members,  
I am working on a Devanagari keyboard for mobile devices. For graphics purpose I need a non-unicode Sanskrit font which have all the Devanagari symbols including **ऒ, ॊ, ऎ, ॆ, ः, ृ, ॄ, ऋ, ॠ, ॢ, ॣ, ऌ, ॡ, ॒, ॑, ॓, ॔, ॐ, ॥, ऽ**. I checked lot of fonts like Sanskrit 99, Krutidev etc but none of them contains all of the above symbols. Lot of Unicode fonts with above symbols are there but they can't be used in graphics programs like Photoshop as it does not support Unicode, that's why I need non-unicode font.  
  
Also is there any font which have all vedic Sanskrit characters/symbols? I wonder which font the publishers of Sanskrit books use for such ancient symbols.
