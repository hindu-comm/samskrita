Hi,



Please refer to e-nagari OT from the Indolipi Package.



It has all the necessary half-forms, vowel signs, Samyuktasharasetc in the Private Use Area of the font.



(You can access the PUA using Character Map or Insert Symbol facility in MS Word)



<http://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/indtib/INDOLIPI/Indolipi.htm>



Code2000 font also has the necessary character in the PUA. You may want to try it out too.



With Regards,



Vinodh Rajan S
