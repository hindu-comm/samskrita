Hi,

  

It is not Vedic usage at all. "अर्धविसर्गसदृशौ जिह्वामूलीयोपाध्मानीयौ" is the description of these two prescribed in general by the Paninian rule: कुप्वोXकXपौ among the Sandhi rules. And illustrated as  
वृक्षXखनति, वृक्षःखनति। वृक्षXपचति, वृक्षः पचति। वृक्षXफलति, वृक्षः फलति। etc. which are not at all Vedic usages.

  

About Rotated Visarga, I do not have any idea.

  

There is one sign to represent nasal vowels after a consonant:

  
ँ as दधिँ मधुँकुमारीँetc. as perPanini sUtra 8.4.57 “अणो ऽप्रगृह्यस्यानुनासिकः " . But these are not used in normal language nor represented in printed texts anyhow. In Vedic texts these are found represented differently before certain vowels with अनुस्वारin Yajurveda texts generally. I do not have this symbol. This might have been termed as Rotated Ardhavisarga as it is put above the single half visarga. or अर्धविसर्ग.

  

With regards
