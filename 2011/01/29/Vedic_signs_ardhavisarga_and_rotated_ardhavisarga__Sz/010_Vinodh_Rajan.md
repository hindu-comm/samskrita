Dear Hari,

  

A friend of mine, Shriramana Sharma had originally proposed it to Unicode. (I have CC'd him)

  

The Image was from his proposal to Unicode.

  

To quote from his proposal, the rotated Ardha Visarga is used to distinctly represent the Jihvaamuuliya by some people.

  

If any one needs more details on the Character, please drop him a mail.
