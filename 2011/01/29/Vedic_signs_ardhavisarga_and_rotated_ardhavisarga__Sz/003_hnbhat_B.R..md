Thanks.

  

Rightly said by Naresh. Both जिह्वामूलीय and उपाध्मानीय are called अर्धविसर्गसदृश. Both are used to represent a different pronunciation of the normal विसर्ग before क, ख, प and फ as per the rule कुप्वो x क x पौ (८।४।३). I have used x only here as I do not have the font. I forgot to mention the names in my post.
