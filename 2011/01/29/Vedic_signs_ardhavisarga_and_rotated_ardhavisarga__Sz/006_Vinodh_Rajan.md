Hi,

  

The Ardha Visarga is used to represent, the Vedic sounds - Jihvamuliya \[Voiceless Velar Fricative\] & Upadhmaniya \[Voiceless Bilabial Fricative\].

  

In Vedic Sandhi, the Visarga when followed by the Voiceless Velar Plosives \[ka & kha\] becomes Jihvaamuuliiya. In a similar way, when the Visarga is followed by a Voiceless Bilabial Plosives it becomes Upadhmaaniiya. In both the cases the phonemes are represented using the same character - Ardha-Visarga.

  

Some publications use the rotated Ardha Visarga to distinctly differentiate between Jihvamuliya and Upadhmaniya.
