Dear Vinod,

Is there a remote possibility that Sriramana Sharma would be able to  
produce them in the context they appear in the Vedic Literature, if he  
is the same person I know referred to by the member Vinod (who  
provided the unicode png image for rotated ardhavisarga). Can you  
contact him for us in this matter?

One Sriramana I know is a great Vedic Scholar and Grammarian, who is  
heading a traditional Veda Pathashala presently in the native place of  
Sri Scchidanadabrahmendra Saraswati,\[ a Vedantin and renowned Composer  
of his time (equally avadhuta)\].

I got a valuable information from him that लृ ए ओ ऎ औ have long and  
short pronunciations too in some of the Vedic recensions according to  
Mahabhashya (but presently no such recension is available). According  
to grammarians, the first has no long vowel and pluta (except in some  
special case), and the others do not have short vowels. Some body  
asked me this question to me and got it clarified from him when he  
visited our Institution.

Probably he may be the same one as he is now trying to produced  
Unicode for Grantha characters used for writing Sanskrit in Tamilnadu  
(before Devanagari script was popularized in prints in South).

With regards
