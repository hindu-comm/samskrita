I believe the ardhavisargas are of 2 types -> jihvAmUlIya and upadmAnIya. 

1\. visarga followed by p, ph is upadmAnIya.  (namaH pArvatI...)

2\. visarga followed by k, kh is jihvAmUlIya (rAmaH khalu vIraH)

Both are pronounced as 'half visargas'. And, in earlier publications / typesettings (printed matter), these 2 symbols (2 semicircles each, in upadmAnIya oriented 'oppositely' from jihvAmUliYa) are to be seen.

  

I am not sure if 'duHka' falls under category 2 above. (visarga embedded in a word, as opposed to occurring between 2 words).
