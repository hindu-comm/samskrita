I think there is no such phoneme as अर्धविसर्ग, but only to aspirate phonemes in euphony before the letters belonging to कवर्ग and पवर्ग. (क, ख, प and फ) for the normal विसर्ग (ः). This phoneme is represented by two semicircles inverted in Devanagari script which is described as अर्धविसर्गसदृश resembling half visarga. If two circles perpendicularly placed are विसर्ग, the two semicircles may be called अर्धविसर्ग. In itrans software,

  

About rotated "ardhavisarga" I have no idea. May be some special euphony in Vedic language according to rules of articulation as per प्रातिशख्य-s. But I do not have any acquaintance with them. There are several of them, only Vedic scholars would recognize them. If I can see the gif image, I could have been able to say something, if possible. I could not see anything in the link. The above is also a guess only with the help of my limited knowledge of grammar of Sanskrit.

  

Hope some one would come forward with some help.

  

With regards
