Thanks Vimalaji for explaining the sets.

  

I could not read the first message yesterday itself as pointed out by Mr. Ramakrishna.

  

Any how, I want to add that it in both it is not not the case of bahuvrihi

as mentioned by Mr.Eddie, though in syntactical function is the same as adjectival phrase/clause is the difference between the two karmadhaaraya and bahuvrihi compounds. Here grammatically it is simply two noun clauses conjoined by virtue of "dvanda" as for karmadharaya, will be between two noun and adjective words and could not be betwen two adjectives. But exceptionally two adjectives are coordinated by the rule, in spite its requirements visheshana and visheshya. such as above.

  

सच्चाप्यस्ति ह्यसच्चापि*सदसच्चापि*विद्यते। सुगमा न हि बुद्धानामाभिप्रायैकदेशिनाम्॥४४॥



The above is the example for the first set you quoted. The case of above Sutra-s is द्वन्द्व in spite of their being adjectives as pointed out by Naresh just noticed as I was typing my answer.

  

Hope this simplifies the interpretation. अतीतं च अनागतं च अतीतानागते , तयोः ज्ञानम्।

meaning is simple = knowledge past and future (things having three states (परिणाम) Dharma, Lakshana and avastha).

  

And Naresh is right in taking into consideration the requirement of the context for analyzing the compounds. The popular maxim is "अभिधानलक्षणा हि कृत्तद्धितसमासाः।" "The rules of grammar relating to Krit, taddhita and samaasa have to be appied taking into consideration of the specific usages."



With regards
