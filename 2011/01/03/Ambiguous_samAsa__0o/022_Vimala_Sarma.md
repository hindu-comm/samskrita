Dear Friends

I have to correct myself, after reading more about these dvandvas comprising opposite pairs.

I said (see below) that dvandvas have dual endings normally, if both elements are in singular (eg a cat and a dog), and that is correct in general; but these dvandvas where there are opposites in conjunction, are a special case, and **are always declined in the singular** – it is taken as one concept, such as dharmAdharma; sadasat, karmAkarma, carAcara, etc. These examples come from the gItA.**



The rule is given in pANini:

Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.9, yeṣām ca virodhaḥ śāśvatikaḥ
