Dear Naresh,

  

I have already explained why the interpretation as suggested by Mr.Dhananjaya Vaidya is not applicable in the second case quoting काशिका and the real state of the compound as explained by वाचस्पतिमिश्र।

  

And in the first case, the rule for karmadharaya doesn't make them as fit for the compound formation. But even both are attributive, only there could be dvandva. as both are गुणवाचक. like न्युब्जखञ्जौ, वामनपामनौ etc. which is grammatically acceptable and here they denote two classification of the वृत्ति-s. The simple reason is because both are adjective and could not form कर्मधारय compound as such. In the case of क्तेन नञ्विशिष्टेन अनञ् there could not be plural form as per the examples suggest. In that case, it would mean partly क्लिष्ट and partly अक्लिष्ट. एकदेशस्य करणात्कृतम्, एकदेशान्तरस्याऽकरणात्तदेवाऽकृतम्।The highlighted portion from the explanation in Balamanorama. I will feed back on referring to the commentaries further.

  

With regards

  

  

  

  

Any other explanation I find in other commentaries, I will feed back.

  

धन्यवादाः।
