Sorry to reply differently from H N Bhat and Naresh Cuntoor, even  
though I really agree with the unambiguous meaning they provide.  
  
These pastparticple-not-pastparticiple are not thought of as dvandva  
in pANinian tradition but as tatpurSha.  
With apologies to Eddie, but for the advantage of other readers, I  
quote the relevant sUtra:  
2\\.1\\.60 ktena na\~nvishiShTenAna\~n  
  
And the two words being of the same case, this is the karmadhAraya  
variety of tatpuruSha.  
  
The way the traditional explanation is given, I cannot really make out  
why this should be tatpurusha and not dvandva - the traditional  
explanation states that compounds of this variety are only applied to  
groups of objects. One of the opposites being a qualifier of some  
members of the group, and the other opposite qualifies other members.  
So in kliShTA.akliShTAH vRuttayaH :  
There is reference to a group of vRutti-s some of which are kliShTa  
and some are akliShTa  
  
Why does pANini not analyze this as a dvandva? So far it beats me.  
Because I cannot really explain why this should be equally well  
explained as dvandva (though the traditional explanation as tatpurusha  
is also satisfying) with exactly the same meaning, I apologize to  
Naresh and Shri H N Bhat. One guess would be that there may be  
something distinguishable about the accents. But I could not find  
anything confirming this thought. As far as I can tell, either dvandva  
or this type of tatpuruSha would have an udAtta accent on the lart  
vowel. Try this thought please, and see if you like it : karmadhAraya  
suppresses the "and"-meaning of while dvandva emphasizes the "and"-  
meaning of such compounds.  
  
By the way, Eddie. There should be no ambiguity in the meaning as far  
as I can tell.  
  
Regards,  
Dhananjay
