Dear Eddie

As I have already indicated I know nothing or very little about Yoga sUtras. If ou want to delve into the interpretation of these in the philosophical meaning according to the tradition, I suggest you find a teacher who is well versed in the sUtras and a practitioner of the discipline and go to the teacher “with fire-stick in hand”, as we say, ie with the proper attitude, and discuss these matters with the teacher. He or she will give an explanation in his/her own way. That is the tradition and I think Bhat Mahodaya indicated this also in a previous e-mail.



I don’t really understand what you mean by “divine nature” of the work.
To give you a partial answer, the traditional recognises the Vedas as “revelations” because they are supposed to be handed down through the oral tradition by the RSis, that this long lineage is given at the end of every UpaniSad going right back to Brahma or one of the deities – so it is considered divine in the tradition. No one is supposed to have written it – it is apauruSa. However the gItA is a work embedded in a larger work, the MahabhAratha which is supposed to be written by VyAsa (though he may be a mythological figure). Even so this text (*GItA)*, is considered a sort of honorary
