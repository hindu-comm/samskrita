Dear Eddie

These pairs are not a range because things are either one or the other, not in between, so all things are covered.

Examples:

sadAsat – existing and non-existing (there is nothing in between) – meaning living things and non-living things.

calAcalam – moving and non-moving (nothing in between) – meaning plants and animals

karmAkarmam – action and non-action, work and non-work.

shubhAshubham – auspicious and inauspicious



You can find more of these pairs in the GItA



Hope this explains

Vimala
