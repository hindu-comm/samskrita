All,



More by way of general interpretation, rather than of grammatical analysis, how are **bahu**-**vrīhi** compounds such as the two below, to be read?



I am assuming that they are indeed adjectival, with kliṣṭa'kliṣṭāḥ qualifying vṛttayaḥ

and atīta-anāgata qualifying jñānam.





Taking them to be two polar opposites, qualified by a single range, gives an exclusiveness - a clear cut separation.

Viz. a troubled state v a state devoid of such, or the past as distinct from the future, and both distinct from the present.



Whereas taken as a single range, defined by two borders, there is inclusiveness.

Viz. the whole variety of states, easy to hard, and the dynamic contiguous course of events.



The first, would suggest a qualitative change, a quantum jump into another, remotely different state of being.

Whereas, the later suggests a quantitative change, a somewhat less ambitious objective of changing this closely familiar state of being for the better.



Here, I’m looking for the simple answer – are such compounds ambiguous by nature, and if not, what am I missing in my understanding of the various samāsa?
