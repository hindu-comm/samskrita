　Vimala et al,

I can see that the grammarians amongst the learned members are exercising their learning.

(The Pāṇinian rule is to be found at 2.4.9, of course.)

However, my concerns are somewhat less lofty, as I have tried to express.

Namely, that of the nature of the work, which just happens to be written in the Sanskrit language.

No one would dispute the The Gīta is a work of a divine nature - pertaining to the Supreme Being.

But to regard the work of Patañjali as also being of a divine nature, gives rise to some perplexity.

Re: Patañjali III. 16 Pariṇāma-traya-saṃyamāt atīta-anāgata-jñānam.

As a divine statement, it is interpreted as having the object of discovering something of the past or in the future by divination - by appealing directly to the Universal Power.

As a wordly statement, it is interpreted as having the object of discovering something of the past or in the future by inference - by invoking the more lowly mental power.

To interpret the Patañjali sūtras as work of a divine nature, requires that the preceding sūtras, giving instructions by means of which the objective is to be obtained, be of a worshipful nature, whereas they are clearly of a cognitive nature - very much pertaining to the mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, reasoning, emotional and volitional.　

Hence my perplexity with the interpretation of III. 16 (and, in consequence the entire work) as given by the grammarians among you.

All the commentaries, old and new, uncritically regard the entire work, if not specifically divine, then as least of a super/paranormal nature.



Such is the received wisdom.

While even a little superficial scrutiny, suggests such a view requires justification.

Common sense requires that we have a *samāhara* here. Real life is not so simple as being a black or white matter. It comes in ever changing shades of black-white. How to make for less black and more white is what this work is all about, surely?
