I agree with Vimalaji, though I could not completely follow the view presented by Mr.Eddie.

For is he referring to the division of time according to Grammatical analysis in the compound or the analysis of time by Yoga, (at par with Sankhya and Buddhist philosophy) that made him initiate the discussion.

  

It is generally said that the Yoga system as interpreted by Vyasa commentary follows the exposition of cosmology and metaphysics to great extent both Sankhya and Buddha.

  

Now, the division of past and past begins from the present point backwards and forwards and present is the meeting point and everything in the cosmology is limited by time and space except Ishvara (beyond the limits of time and space). In that sense it is all pervasive concept.

  

For grammatical analysis too, the present moment is the dividing point for tenses past and future. The immediate future and immediate past can be expressed with the present tense verbal form also by virtue of the rule वर्तमानसामीप्ये वर्तमानवद्वा. And forward and backward relative divisions are अद्यतन अनद्यतन past and Future tenses. Imperfect is लिट् which takes into consideration of the point of narration also in addition to the division अनद्यतन past परोक्ष. Otherwise, it is covered by अनद्यतने लङ् लूङ् (aorist) covers both in common past within 24 hours from the point of present.

  

The time limitation referred to ईश्वर as the foremost Teacher without the bounds of the time limits backwards (which is referred to स हि पूर्वेषामपि गुरुः कालेनानवच्छेदात् (translation given by himself). The concept of ईश्वर is to keep a super पुरुष untouched with क्लेश and bounds of time so as to help meditation or चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध and no more part is played by this ईश्वर and this is one of the features of distinguishing Yoga from its twin system Sankhya. The concept of काल in this सूत्र is from the smallest fraction क्षण up to प्रलय. This concept is based on the concept of Bauddha-s basically. On introspection thorough scrutiny some distinguishing features may be found. For a general parallelism is between the concept of क्षण is the real base of the unlimited time and it is undivided, each moment the world changes for the moment is momentary and so the world witnessed. But due to the क्रम past क्षण cannot be present one, and so future one too. As he has rightly observed, it is a continuous stream of changing क्षण. This is parallel to क्षणिकविज्ञान and आलयविज्ञान of the buddhist philosophy, but need not be identical. This continuity makes people make unreal assumption of क्षण, नाडी, मुहूर्त, होरा, दिन, मास etc. This seems to be the concept of Yoga philosophy as 3.52 in the commentary.

  

Now coming to the point raised by Mr.Eddie, for grammatical analysis, Patanjali has to use the common assumption to coin compounds and so अतीत and अनागत is explained as अवस्थापरिणाम-s of the things in the world by commentary. So also it is better not to confound the two independent concepts and make a confusion between the two as each is limited to its own sphere. Grammar to language and linguistic analysis and Yoga philosophy by itself have its own nomenclatures of काल. The above quoted example is only sample. So by past we should take the meaning in the common usage of the language and should not confound with the contiguity of क्षण. This my opinion as I read the above post. More from the scholars from each field, is only welcome.

  

Now coming to the question of क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः there is another technical explanation for each. What are क्लिष्ट and what are considered as अक्लिष्ट् as explained in the commentaries. As it is too long for this post, I reserve the presentation of both of these to my next message on receiving replies to the point raised. The grammatical analysis doesn't change in any case from the ones given by me as explained in my previous post.



With regards
