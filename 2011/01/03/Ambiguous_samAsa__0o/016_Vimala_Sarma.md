I do not know enough about the philosophy of the yoga sUtras to know what PatANjali means by kliSTa, so I did not comment on this particular compound but gave my own examples. In the Buddhist sense, it could mean defilements and these are very specific - so things could either be a defilement or not. Yoga philosophy draws from SAnkya and Buddhism.

But in this case it could also mean painful or pleasant (thoughts), because I think yoga is about “stilling the turnings of the mind” cittavRti nirodha. In this case also there are a specific things referred to, not a gradation, but this is just my opinion.



As both Bhat Mahodaya and Naresh Mahodaya have said, this is a conjunction with “and’ between two things, a dvandva compound, but it depends on usage whether this is a bahuvRhi also. All types of compounds, can be used as bahuvRhis if they describe a third substantive (ie a noun). If both elements are in singular as substantives, the compound would have a dual ending, like kliStAkliSTau. However it does not have a dual ending but plural masc nominative ending so it could be
unpleasantnesses and pleasantnesses as plural substantives, but it is more likely that it is a bahuvRhi describing vRttaya which is plural also, so it is an adjective agreeing with the noun, in case, number and gender. So we now have “painful and pleasant turnings (of the mind) are five-fold”.



If there is a gradation of states, ie many options, then a dvandva of this kind (opposites) would not be used – this is again just my opinion.



Regarding the grammar of the past, present and future – these are my thoughts.



The immediate past uses the imperfect tense – the augment ‘a-‘ with the imperfect ending – eg abhavat (something that happens within your lifetime)

The remote past uses the perfect with has the reduplicative – babhUva (this is something that happened say in the time of RAma)

The indefinite past, ie aorist – something which happened in the past but could also happen to-day – abhut. (there are several forms of the aorist)

The present indicative active is used not only for the present tense but also in the immediate future, say tomorrow – bhavati

The future is something that will happen in the future with a certain probability – bhavisyati.

The are also the periphrastic past and future also, but I think this is enough for now.
