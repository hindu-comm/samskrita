Gentlemen,



 This sametopic appears underdifferentheadings, due to the different encoding schemes.



However, in connection with the*sam-āsa* *atīta-anāgata-jñānam*, is it possibly a *samāhāra*, especially as the last member is in the neuter gender?



As an aggregate gone-notgone/past-future removes the perceiveddiscrepency between the *vigraha*and the *vākya* - between the grammar and the text.
