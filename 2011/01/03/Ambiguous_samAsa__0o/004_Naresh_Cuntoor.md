\> I am assuming that they are indeed adjectival, with kliṣṭa'kliṣṭāḥ qualifying vṛttayaḥ

These are adjectives. But not in bahuvrIhi samAsasa.  
क्लिष्टाः च अक्लिष्टाः च क्लिष्टाऽक्लिष्टाः (द्वन्द्वसमासः)  
kliShTAH ca akliShTAH ca kliShTA&kliShTAH (dvandvasamAsaH)

\> Here, I’m looking for the simple answer – are such compounds ambiguous by nature, and if not, what am I missing in my understanding of the various samāsa?  
\>

I don't think one can give a general answer here. Some compounds are  
unambiguous. Some aren't - and require contextual or other  
clarification.

In the specific case of vRuttayaH ... Vyasa's commentary does not look  
upon this as a discrete separation.  
atIta-anaagata on the other hand, is more straightforward and refers  
to the past and future. By definition, atIta is not anAgata.
