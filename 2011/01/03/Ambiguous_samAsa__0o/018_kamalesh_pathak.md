sorry to all you elders to interrupt the classic discussions but sri H N Bhatt and Eddie and Naresh were referring Patanjali's yogaSutra's first Shloka --> yogashchittavritti nirodhah. i just want tosay that perhaps Shankara bhAshya on brahmasUtra can more define this though budhdhist philosophy may weight upon such bhAsyas.

with regards,
