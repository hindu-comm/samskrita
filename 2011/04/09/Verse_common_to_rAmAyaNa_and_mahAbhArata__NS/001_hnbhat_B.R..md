According to C V Vaidya, the portion of Viduraniti, stands alonge without any relation to preceding and and following portion of the text and is considered to be a later compilation and interpolated into the text. This portion is common to many other subhashita-s found elsewhere.

  

The story of Ramayana itself is narrated briefly in Mahabharata, in some occasion, against the belief that Ramayana was composed in Anushtup by the first of poets. I have not checked the location.
