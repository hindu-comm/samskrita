Thanks for your response.

  

I am also aware that there are Vedic Grammar texts though I have not utilized them. In Panini too we have explanation of certain Vedic usages, and for most part he has accepted them as such "chandasi bahulam" as variant to the regular forms. There many rules out of approximately 4000 rules dealing with Sanskrit rules, But according to Nirukta, vedic words are not to be commented in isolation.

  

"Naikam padam nirbrUyaat". It is this view I reflected and that there is no Vedic grammar rules in Paninian system. What I meant was lexicographers used to note the vedic forms even without using (arch.) or (ved.) to give their meaning. People using the terms would naturally claim regularity of the words judged by the rules applicable to classical Sanskrit. This was my view. Not that there are no Vedic Grammar texts by European Sanskrits or they were unaware of Vedic grammar. You have seen the difference of interpretation of the same Rik by both: Griffith and Sayana and free translation.

  

Any more comments on the questions discussed, are welcome.

  

Thanks once again, for responding as the first one to go through.
