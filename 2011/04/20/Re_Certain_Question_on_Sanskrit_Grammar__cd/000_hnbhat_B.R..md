According to Paninian standard, cardinal and ordianl numbers have different forms, as you may be aware. Some numerals are used as both. The question raised by you is with the particular number 28:

  

A. "aSTaviMzatau dinAGke" B. "aSTaviMze dinAGke" C. "aSTaviMzati-dinAGke" D. "aSTaviMza-dinAGke"  



I think you picked up this question to chose the correct answer from the avg.learnsanskrit site as you have referred to. I have highlighted the correct answer. You may find the explanation too for this in the same site, if you had followed the lessons regularly in the order they are presented. Anyway, I give the explanation for your benefit as well as the members of this group here too:

  

The cardinal number is अष्टाविंशतिः - 28. The number twenty eight. The
explanation for this will be अष्टाधिका विंशतिः - अष्टाविंशतिः, a compound between अष्टन् + विंशति.(८+२०). It is derived in the same way as द्वाविंशतिः (२+२०). The rule for this change of the forms of the preceding words is here:

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/6-3-47.html>

  

You can refer to the rule yourself or from the avg site with explanation in english. Now, for the ordinal number 28th the form is highlighted in the question you have copied from the other site. Hope you will find the explanation for the form in the site too. Anyhow, the rule applicable for getting the form is here:

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/6-4-142.html>

  

which states the cardinal number विंशति loses its ending ति before the cardinal suffix with ड् augmentation lost. The cardinal forming suffix affixed to ordinal numbers includes ड \> अ. Now the formation will be like this cardinal number 28th derived from the above cardinal number:

  

अष्टाविंशति + अ \> अष्टाविंश \> in the nominative singular अष्टाविंशः।

  

Now you might have noticed that the highlighted form B is correct and the other forms are incorrect according to Paninian rules governing the cardinal numeral formation from its corresponding ordinal number अष्टाविंशति. That was purpose of the question in the exercise in the avg learning lessons. According to strict analysis, it is the only possible form. and other forms are not acceptable.

  

The second marked as D and given by Sri Abhyankarji is also correct as the optional form for the same according to a different interpretation of the rule governing तम cardinal suffix.

  

Check yourself the interpretations of the rule here:

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/5-2-56.html>

  

Both are correct forms and can be used as cardinal number 28th. अष्टाविंशे or अष्टाविंशति-तमे दिनाङ्के as non compoundअष्टाविंशति-तमे दिनाङ्केusages. You can use these two in compound form also as you have given. Though there is no much difference, but clarity will be without compound formation with दिनाङ्क which again is a coined word for the English word "date" if I am right in guessing. In Sanskrit it is enough if you use अष्टाविंशे दिने twenty eighth day which would mean the same. Now you can review your question again for the correctness of the usage. If you mean date, it is today 28 cardinal number of this month or is it 28th day or date of this month? A question for you, and you are free to use in the same sense choosing between the two forms in Sanskrit as given above. Now the ball is in your court. Depends on your answer to the question what is the date today or Monday next?

In the news "2011-feb-12 2:26 morning" it's said "bharatam ... saMyukta-arab-emirat-dezam anuruddhavAn".  
Shouldn't it be "bharatam ... saMyukta-arab-emirat-dezam anuruddhavat"? Maybe it's implied that bharatam=bharatadezaH?  

  

> (२) "भारतम्"-शब्दे शब्दमूलं तु "भारत" इति अकारान्तम् । यदि "भारत" इति > देशस्य नाम, तदा "भारतः" इति प्रथमाविभक्त्यां एकवचने। यदि ग्रन्थस्य > नाम तदा "भारतम्" इति प्रथमाविभक्त्यां एकवचने।  

  

We traditionally locate this region as

  

भारत-वर्षे भरत-खण्डे जम्बूद्वीपे .. ..... ........... .- etc.



where both भारत and भरत are used. Now it is the word from the news reading you have quoted, I don't think it need be analysed according to Paninian standards as the denotation is limited to the news preparation. Even if you don't use desha, it would mean the same as Arab Emirate, Russia, which do not augment country as they themselves suggest they are names of the country. You can take भारतम् or भारत as they are taken by the news preparers.

  

  

3---------------------------------------  
In the 8th mantra of zrI IzopaniSad it is said "sa paryagAc chukram akAyam avraNam...". I don't understand the word paryagAt (tence etc.). It is translated as "such a person (sa) must know in fact (paryagAt) the omnipotent (zukram), unembodied (akAyam), without reproach (avraNam )...". Maybe it's the aorist of pari-gA but according to MW-dictionary the meaning seems to be the opposite.

Just I reversed the order of pasting your question for easy reference and comparison with Abhyankar's answer. Both are wrong in your guessing simply from the forms you see without knowing the grammar. As it happens, you are free to guess anything. But subjecting the form you have raised, to Paninian analysis, you should bear in mind that Paninian standards are different from the standard followed by Monier Williams and other lexicon compilers (mostly linguists with knowledge of many other classical languages other than Sanskrit). According to Paninian analysis, the form you have given is from a Vedic text and needs utmost care to derive its meaning from the context and analysis can be offered on the basis of the commentaries giving the meaning for the Vedic words, while for linguists, there is no distinction between archaic Vedic usage or classical sanskrit and they take at par with their knowledge of classical Sanskrit and its translations in their language. Now coming to the analysis of the word as offered by Panini would be it is derived from the root इण् गतौ 2nd conjugation parasmaipadin. Present tense will be एति - इतः - यन्ति।

In the Aorist tense लुङ् it is substituted by गा. Now you can derive it with the process of conjugation from the substitute, and get अगात् l अगात् - अगाताम् - अगुः etc.  

like अस्थात् - अस्थाताम् - अस्थुः (from स्था)

  

  

And from the गम् root the Auorist form will be

  

अगमत् - अगमताम् - अगमन्

  

and the other past will be लङ् -

  

अगच्छत् - अगच्छताम् - अगच्छन्



I am not touching the translation you have given. It may take a long moderation since it is Vedic text dealing with Upanishat philosophy.

> (४) अवगाहः स्नानम् निमज्जनम् एते शब्दाः समानार्थिनः तु दृश्यन्ते । > तेषां अर्थेषु सूक्ष्मभेदाः अपि । यथा स्नानम् कतिचित् पयेनापि क्रियते । > परन्तु निमज्जनाय जलाशयः आवश्यकः ।  

  



I think Abhyankar is right in his assessment.

  

Literally the words mean to to अवगाहते = dives into, (literally too it is used meaning go deep into any subject or topic) while निमज्जन means to take bath. (to clean oneself. and literally to drown into or dive into). The different shades are to be known from their usages in different contexts. शास्त्रावगाहः means deep knowledge in Shastra-s. अवगाहनम् litterally means a शास्त्रे निमग्नः means concentrating on Shastra. The same with स्नान which literally means to clean oneself or wash oneself. But the derived words निष्णातः = means skilled in any subject, expert and स्नातकः - who have finished his study of Veda-s or the perfomance of any Yaga.

  

  

5---------------------------------------  
How to say in sanskrit "What is the difference between A and B?"."ko vizeSaH ...?"

  

> (५) अ-ब-योः कः भेदः ?  

  

Well, my frank answer to the question is that A and B are the letters of English alphabet and the Abhyankar's translation doesn't in any way convey the same meaning you wanted. As the case may be there is no facility use foreign words in Sanskrit as in English. This is my answer. Then what is the use of the translation if it doesn't convey the meaning intended?



> (६) मुद्रास्फीति-नियंत्रणं आर्थिक-विकासश्च उभे प्रशासनस्य प्राथमिकते > स्तः । एतत्तु सुष्ठु दृश्यते । पश्यताम् -  
> > -   प्राथमिकते "प्राथमिकता" इति स्त्रीलिङ्गि नाम । तस्य प्रथमा >     विभक्तिः द्विवचनं च । > -   उभे "उभ" इति विशेषणम् । अत्र स्त्रीलिङ्गि । तस्य प्रथमा विभक्तिः >     द्विवचनं च ।

  

But the question was raised in the meaning intended. I have no suggestion about the grammatical status, but उभ is considered as a pronoun equivalent to both. The word is derived from प्रथम + इक >\> प्राथमिक (First, Primary) and then derive प्राथमिकता = priority.उभे = both are,प्राथमिकते = the two priorities of the government.

  

7----------------------------------------  
In the news (2011-feb-22-morning 2:29) it is said that "nava-mAsapUrvam, asau eteSAm AkramaNAnAM kRte doSI iti nirNIya tasmai mRtudaNDAdezaH zrAvita AsIt". I guess it means that "9 months ago, a death sentence was declared to him, according to which he is to be considered guilty of those terror attacks". But should nirNiya have some ending?



> (७) निर्णीय "निः + नी" १ प इति धातुः । तस्मात् भूतकालवाचकं ल्यबन्तं > अव्ययम् "निर्णीय" ।  

  

Here too the question is not the correctness of the form, but its use in the sentence. I too agree with you that the sentence is ill formed translated from some sentence prepared in English. As Abhyankar has said, there is no need of any case ending for grammaticality of the word. But on the total, the sentence is clumsy. Probably it means the same as you have guessed.



  

> (८) श्रीलङ्का-देशे "सिंहली" तथा "तमिळ" इति द्वे भाषे भाष्येते इत्यहं > जानामि ।  

  

No comments as it is not concerned with Sanskrit.

No comments. There is direction of articulation of foreign words in Sanskrit unless they are borrowed and assimilated into the classical sanskrit like दीनार, होरा, फनस etc. And the question is about their representation in Devanagari script.



> (१०) प्रश्नः सुष्ठु न ज्ञातः । क्षमस्व ।  

  

The same comment as Abhyankar's. The usage of "asti" is simple present tense form (and not periphrastic future tense) and can be used either in the near future or near past along with the normal forms in both. Anyhow the usage by the news reader cannot be analyzed out of its context of news reading room (with will be accompanied invariably by video-s) in news channels on TV.  


> (११) "आयर्लण्ड: सप्तविंशति-धावाङ्कैः पराजितः" एतत् सुष्ठु खलु ?  

  

Again it is the translation of Ireland (team) was defeated by 27 runs (a term used in Cricket) which is foreign to Sanskrit.

No comments on cricket match related questions.



> (१३) वाक्ये अध्याहृतं कर्तृपदं "(सः)" । "चक्षुः" इति कर्मपदं > द्वितीया-विभक्त्याम् ।  

  

It is a single complex sentence and no need for a adhyahara in the middle of the sentence as in English translation.



कृष्णसारे ददच्चक्षुस्त्वयि चाधिज्यकार्मुके\|

मृगानुसारिणंसाक्षात्पश्यामीव पिनाकिनम्\|\|६॥

  

Monier-Williams translation: "

Casting (my) eye on the black-antelope and on thee with-thy-strungbow  
I behold, as it were, Siva visibly present chasing the deer."

The charioteer (sUtaH) looks both at the king and the antelope.  

  

I can't understand your doubt. It is very clear that the translation closely follows the text (except the order modified for English Order).

  

> I dont understand "dadat cakSus".Is cakSus here in nominative case or > accusative? Is dadat here in nominative case or accusative? If the > word dadat meant that the sUtaH is casting the eye it whould be dadan > and not dadat. sUtaH dadat cakSus is wrong, right?

  

No. You are wrong totally. It is right and proper nominative singular of the word dadat. and it cannot be ददन् like other present participles. I think your problem is solved.

  

> mRgAnusAriNaM sAkSAt pazyAmIva pinAkinam" is aham although it is not > said explicitly? And both the subjects are in nominative case?

  

Though the second proposition is right, it is the same agent of the present participle in the first half ददत् and चक्षुः is the object of the participle in the nominative case. But the subject is the same charioteer, as explicitly notified by Monier Williams. And no need to add agent with the active voice verbs used in the 2nd person and 1st person according to Paninian rule as the agent is implied in the inflexed form itself. But it is not the same case with the verbs in the 3rd person, which may differ from context to context to which the pronoun tad refers.

  

Sorry for the lengthy answer.

> 

  

Here is the related chapter. I leave Abhyankar to elucidiate the context.

  

As usual, I am concerned with the grammatical structure of the verse and the translation is given by Bhaktivedantasvami anyway. I cannot comment on it. But it is Bhagavata usage archaic usages could be expected. As an idiomatic phrase, it is simply statement emphasizing on worshiping Hari in addition to observing his own duties failing which he may fall anywhere in between and any calamity can happen. 

  

> , kva, vA, kim. What meaning does each one of them add? If we didn't > use kim, or kva or vA whould the meaning change? Are any of those > words optional and the meaning whouldn't change much and if we omited > some of them? If we use yadi shouldn't it be tatra instead of yatra > then?

  



They are used in sequence in an idiomatic expression: यत्र क्व वा अभद्रमभूद्? Was there any calamity any where? literally and sircastically . If he falls anywhere ( यत्र क्व वा) rrom his path, due to immaturity), what is (undesirable) lost to him? Rhetoric question. Nothing more than that. But what is the gain who stick to his obligations, without serving Hari?

  

I think this much is the essence of the translation of Bhaktivedanta swamy. And यदि = if only governs a future verb. it is already there patet. And yatra kutra or yatra kva vaa is idiomatic phrase meaning somewhere or anywhere. It need not any tatra for completion of the phrase.

  

Now the summary of the first half seems to be the same as that of Yogin who falls back for some or other reason from his path as in Bhagavadgita:

>   

> अयतिः श्रद्धया+उपेतो योगाच्चलितमानसः ।

> \* अप्राप्य योगसंसिद्धिं कां गतिं कृष्ण गच्छति ॥६,३७॥



> पार्थ नैव+इह नामुत्र विनाशस्तस्य विद्यते ।

> न हि कल्याणकृत्कश्चिद्दुर्गतिं तात गच्छति ॥६,४०

  

  

The above answer is reverberated here too. by the rhetoric question "kim abhadram abhUd amuShya?"





> 15----------------------

> (१५) वाक्यानां कर्तरि(active)-कर्मणि(passive)-भावे-प्रयोग-भेदाः । > भावे-प्रयोगः संस्कृत-भाषायाः विशेषः ।  

  

I do not find any such technical term in Paninian terminology as "prayoga". It is means just usage of sentences, probably coined after English terminology "voice". Now one question in turn. What is voice in English Grammar other than Active and Passive Voice? Is there any Middle Voice in English or Greek or Latin? I found it used to translate the technical term अत्मनेपद in English lessons teaching Sanskrit grammar.

  

Postscript:

  

Dear Friend,

  

Please shoot me any questions regarding Sanskrit Gramar (may not be proper Vedic language). I am free to answer your question at your disposal. and probably find free time to answer your questions on Sanskrit Language and Literature if any.

  

By the way I have tried to analyse the answers given by Abhyankarji according to Paninian standards.



Yours
