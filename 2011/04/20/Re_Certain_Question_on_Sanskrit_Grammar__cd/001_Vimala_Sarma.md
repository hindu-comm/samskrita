“According to Paninian analysis, the form you have given is from a Vedic text and needs utmost care to derive its meaning from the context and analysis can be offered on the basis of the commentaries giving the meaning for the Vedic words, while for linguists, there is no distinction between archaic Vedic usage or classical sanskrit and they take at par with their knowledge of classical Sanskrit and its translations in their language.”



MacDonnell, Whitney, MW do understand the differences in grammar, roots and phonetics between classical Sanskrit and Vedic. In fact MacDonell has a useful Vedic Grammar text.
