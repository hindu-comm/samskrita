Quoting Bhat-ji's  

  
"If my guess is right, अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः is applicable to the numeral system कटपयादि . Whether it is applied to this numbering system is yet to be verified. It is seen in other texts applied to this system too:"  
  

The katapayaadi system is prevelant in the naming of melakarta ragas in current carnatic system too (kanakangi, ratnangi - all the way to rasikapriya) - the first two letters represent 01, 02, 03 ...upto 72.  
  
If ankaanaam vaamato gati: applies here too, then "kana = 10" becomes "01" which means the number is being read from left-to-right from the number's perspective (from a reader's perspective it is right-to-left).
