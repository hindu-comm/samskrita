प्रिय Arvind,  
Good comment!  
Re: your statement - They are called Arabic numerals because they travelled from India to Europe some time before the 10th century through the Arabs. It is now widely known that their true origin was in India but ‘social drag’

  
ensures that the old name continues.  

My comment: One of my colleagues who teaches Arabic said that in Arabic they call the numerals the 'Hindu number system'!

"It is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and the very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of reason."  
- Charles Darwin (1809 – 1882), The Descent of Man, 1871
