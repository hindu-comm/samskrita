Dear Group,  
  
Dr Bhat observes “But 1, 2, 3 are called Arabic numerals even though  

they are used in English language. I remember having read that 0 was  

Indian contribution. “  
  
They are called Arabic numerals because they travelled from India to  
Europe some time before the 10th century through the Arabs. It is now  
widely known that their true origin was in India but ‘social drag’  
ensures that the old name continues.  
  
0 and the important concept of positional value to digits was another  
very important contribution of the Indians. Just as no one knows who  
invented the first wheel, so also the person or persons who thought of  
this ingenious system of writing numbers are not known. What is  
certain is, however, that this system ‘tamed’ numbers. Any number, no  
matter how large, can be easily worked upon and manipulated with the  
help of the four easily learnt basic operations, when it is expressed  
as per the ‘Indian’ system . The Romans could never have multiplied  
two large multi-digit numbers with the same ease that a schoolboy can  
display today. It is no exaggeration to say that renaissance science  
progressed in Europe only because Indian numeral system had reached  
there by that time, making arithmetical calculations very easy.
