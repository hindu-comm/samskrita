Just reading the first message of Aravindji, it is not special to Sanskrit as he has interpreted एकादश, द्वादश, त्रयोदश etc. numerals.

  

Yes. In writing using numerals they are written from right to left =

  

11, 12, 13, 14 etc.

  

It is the same with English also.

  

Eleven, twelve (two+ten), thirteen (three - tens), fourteen (four+ten) the phonetic changes may be explained in the same way as एकादश, etc. where the individual numbers have undergone little change. Now, Hindi speaker, Aravindji will attest the Hindi numerals too:

  

दस, ग्यारह्, तेरह्, etc. undergoing the changes to from एकादश, द्वादश, etc. sanskrit numbers through Prakrit languages.

  

Is the rule applicable then to Sanskrit only? Possibly not. This is with the pure numerals without any encoding complicated.

  

The two other systems add only change of encoding system. But the same principle is seen applicable in both the examples cited for each. as I have already cited a large number:

  

शुद्धभेदैः सहशरेषुयुगखेन्दवः (१०४५५)

शर - ५,

इषु - ५,

युग - ४,

ख - ०

इन्दु - १ ===== will make the figure given above arranging from right to left beginning from 1 as can be seen in the above example.

  

The same with आयुरारोग्यसौख्यम् denoting a large numeral counting the day of Kali Era as explained by me and Mr.Ramakrishnan.

  

Now the question is which one is meant by अङ्क the first one occurring in the verses or the numeral digits written corresponding to them in the maxim अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः। Strangely enough from our side we are reading it from left to right and while decoding it we have to read it from right to left (from our side). From the page, it will be reverse. It numeral digits has to be decoded by reading towards left of the page. Is this meant by the maxim?

  

In any case, it is too applicable numerals in English. I don't know about other numerals in words and fitures. But 1, 2, 3 are called Arabic numerals even though they are used in English language. I remember having read that 0 was Indian contribution. Comparing numbers in words and figures may help to arrive at the origin of the principle.

  

In Dravidian languages, it is the revers, pattu + randu (10+12) = 12, pattu + onnu - padinonnu 11 etc. there is no change of order between the words denoting them and figures written denoting the numerals.

  

May be the characteristic inherited from Indo European group. representing with figures, it has to change the order.

  

Little farther continued the scrutiny.
