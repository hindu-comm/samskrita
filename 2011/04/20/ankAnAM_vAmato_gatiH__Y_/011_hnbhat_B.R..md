Thanks Arvindji for taking into consideration my observations.

  

To come to the the comparison of English and Sanskrit counting, again, up to the count twenty follows the same in between 11 - 19 and there after too it is changed in English for the intermediate numbers like twenty-one to -nine, thirty-one to -nine and so on.

  

The multiples of 10s are counted in the same order as before. dashat is used for the group of tens in sanskrit as can be seen in the list below.

  

two tens - twenty

dvau dashatau - dvaa-viM-shati

  

three-tens - thirty

tisro dashataH - triM-shat

  

four tens - four-ty

catvaraH dashataH - catvaariM-shat



five tens - fig-ty

pa\~nca dashataH - panca-shat

  

six tens - sixty

Shat dashataH  
  

seven tens - seventy

sapta dashataH - sapta-tiH (hereafter the sanskrit words loose the trace of dashat)

  

astha dashataH - ashItiH (only remainder is ti as in vimshati)

nava dashataH - navatiH

  

Hereafter both lost the trace of the multiples and multipled.

  

dasha dashataH - shataM (only remainder of dashat plus)

ten tens - hundred

  

Dravidian languages maintain through out the same system.

  

3 tens munRu pattu - murpadu(30)p muppadu \_ Onnru(31)
