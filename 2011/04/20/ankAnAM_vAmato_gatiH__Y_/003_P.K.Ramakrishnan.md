There are two methods of denoting numbers in Sanskrit.

  

One is called bhutasamkhya. This name has come from the idea that bhutas are

five in number.  Therefore to denote 5 it is sufficient to say bhuta.
If we want to say

1 it can be said by saying prithivi, the first of the pancha-bhutas. To mean 14 we

can say manu. Here is a quotation from Varahamihira using bhuta-samkhya -

  

दश-शिखि-मनुयुक्-तिथी-न्द्रियांशै:

  

दश = ten

शिखि = अग्नि = 3 referring to the third of

the pancha-bhutas - पृथिवी, अप्, तेज:, वायु:, आकाश:

मनुयुक् = Two manus = 28 (there are 14 manus)

तिथि = 15

इन्द्रिय = 5 (there are 5 indriyas to know श्ब्द रूप रस स्पर्श घ्राण

(ear, eyes, tongue, skin and nose).

अंश refers to degree of the zodiac.

Bhutasamkhya is mostly followed in North India

  

The second system is aksharasamkhya - denoting numbers by letters.

The most common is katapayaadi systemwhich was followed in South India.

  

Vararuchi is supposed to be theauthor of this system.  

Members may be well aware of this system.

  

When this system is followed each letter has a value from 0 to 9.

A number may consist of any number of letters. The magnitude of the

number increases from left to right.

  

For example

  

eka = 1:

dasa = 10

satam = 100

sahasram = 1000

ayutam= 10000

niyutam = 100000

and so on unending.

  

Therefore the statement - 

अंकानां वामतो गति:

  

The number increases from left to right.

  

Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri has used this method to denote the kalidinasambhya when he completed his treatise called Narayaniyam.

  

आयुरारोग्यसौख्यम्

0 1 2 2 1 7 1

But according to the rule -left to right,

this becomes 1712210.

  

Aryabhata has used another method of using letters to denote very large numbers.

Dear Group,

  

In the book ‘History of Hindu Mathematics’ by Bibhutibhushan Datta and Avadhesh Narayan Singh, published in 1935, I came across a comprehensive list of ‘word numerals’, i.e., words employed to record numbers, especially in inscriptions, copper-plate grants, in works on mathematics etc. I enclose it as a .pdf enclosure for those who may be interested in it.

  

As an example of the use of word-numerals, Leelavati says:

  

व्यासे भनन्दाग्निहते विभक्ते

खबाणसूर्यैः परिधि: सुसूक्ष्मः।

द्वाविंशतिनिघ्ने विहृतेऽथ शैलैः

स्थूलोऽथवा स्याद् व्यवहारयोग्यः॥



“if the diameter be multiplied by 3 अग्नि 9 नन्द 27 भ, and divided by 12 सूर्य 5 बाण 0 ख, (the resultant is) the circumference, which is very accurate. Or, if the diameter is multiplied by 22 and divided by 7 शैल, (the resultant circumference) is sufficiently accurate for common tasks.”
