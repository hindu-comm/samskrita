Dear Group,

  

In the book ‘History of Hindu Mathematics’ by Bibhutibhushan Datta and Avadhesh Narayan Singh, published in 1935, I came across a comprehensive list of ‘word numerals’, i.e., words employed to record numbers, especially in inscriptions, copper-plate grants, in works on mathematics etc. I enclose it as a .pdf enclosure for those who may be interested in it.

  

As an example of the use of word-numerals, Leelavati says:

  

व्यासे भनन्दाग्निहते विभक्ते

खबाणसूर्यैः परिधि: सुसूक्ष्मः।

द्वाविंशतिनिघ्ने विहृतेऽथ शैलैः

स्थूलोऽथवा स्याद् व्यवहारयोग्यः॥



“if the diameter be multiplied by 3 अग्नि 9 नन्द 27 भ, and divided by 12 सूर्य 5 बाण 0 ख, (the resultant is) the circumference, which is very accurate. Or, if the diameter is multiplied by 22 and divided by 7 शैल, (the resultant circumference) is sufficiently accurate for common tasks.”

  

As the grants and the mathematical texts were often composed in meters, the wide choice presented by word numerals was very useful.

  

I am trying to understand the well-known rule अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः (the numbers go towards the left, or, alternatively, the words go in the opposite direction, as compared to the normal direction of writing that goes towards the right). It appears to me the rule is applied when the numbers are spoken out and then written down. In that case, the speaker starts with digit (or a group of digits like 27 in the above extract) that, in the written form of the number, appears on the extreme right.
He next speaks out the digit next on the left and so on till he reaches the end. This is meant by अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः.

  

This rule is also seen in the names of cardinal numbers in Sanskrit. In एकादशन् द्वादशन् त्रयोदशन् एकविंशति द्वाविंशति त्रयोविशति and in several other cardinals the digit in the unit place is spoken first and the digit in the tens place comes after it. The way to correctly write down the number thus spoken out is to record the digit first spoken out in the unit place and record the next digit in the tens place to its left, thus moving leftwards.



I request other learned members to comment upon the rule अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः.

  

(An interesting aside. Devanagari, Roman and most other scripts are written and read from the left to the right and putting down or reading a number or a date is done in the natural flow. Some scripts like the Arabic and Persian are written and read from the right to the left.
However, even they record numbers and dates from the left to the right.
It creates a minor obstacle in the process of reading and writing as the eye has to change its direction of movement.)
