We were told in our school that decimal numbers have to be pronounced as individual numbers. e.g. 64.36 is to be pronounced as sixtyfour point three six (and not sixtyfour point thirysix -- since the weight of the number place is to be stated for the numbers to the left of the decimal point, according to our maths teacher)  
  
(I hope, I have understood the question correctly)
