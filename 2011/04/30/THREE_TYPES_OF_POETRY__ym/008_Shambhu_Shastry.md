Ramakrishnan ji, very nice.

  

You may know this, but for the other members:

  

In the present-day Kannada, "mane" is home; "mana" is same as in Samskrita (it is indeedSamskrita). In tuLu, "illu" is home; "illutu" is "in the home" (Enu enna illutu uLLe - I am in my home). I am not aware of "illam" in the present-day colloquial tuLu.

  

Is there any substance in the saying that "kEra Phala" became "kEraLa"?

  

BhavadIyaH,

Shambhu
