Dear friends

The metathesis of sounds is quite common in Pali – It follows the way the word is pronounced in the vernacular:

For example, you may be familiar with the way the word brahma is pronounced by most people – this is usually said like bram-ha (switching the sounds).

Similar for prashna (question) one gets the change to prahna and then to paňha, in Pali.

The change from r to l is very common also so you get lajja for rAjan (stem) in the Western prakrits.

Another change is changing dentals to palatals – saccam for satyam,

There is also a tendency to get of rid conjunct consonants – either by assimilation so that prajNA becomes paňňa, or by adding a vowel in between so that one get tuvam for tvam (you).

Another example asti becomes atthi etc

Final consonants are also got rid of (except anuswaram or nasals) in the vernacular eg tasmAt becomes tasmA
