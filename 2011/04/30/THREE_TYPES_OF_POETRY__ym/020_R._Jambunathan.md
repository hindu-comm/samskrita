My apologies to have incomplete expression"unbelievable" when I had meant to say "unbelievably beautiful,succinct and at same time
comprehensive all encompassing and what else can i add to my wonderment and appreciation of the work". I was at a loss to express to my positive feeling. I made a mistake. I DID NOT MEAN TO IMPLY anything negative at all. I misspoke. I am a great admirer of the work. Once again I APOLOGIZE for my mistake.
