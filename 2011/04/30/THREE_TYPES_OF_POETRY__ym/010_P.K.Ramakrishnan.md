Thanks for your comments. 

  

I am now settled in Bangalore for many years. I know the word for house in Kannada is

mane from which the Nambuthiris call their house as mana. Probably I have not given it

correctly. Similarly the word in Tulu should be illu from which the Namputhiris have

used the word illam.

  

There is no way to justify that kEraphala has become kEraLa.
