Not at all. You might not have notice such cases of metathesis in Sanskrit words. There are many such cases:

  

पृथ्वी, पृथिवी, सुवर्णः, स्वर्णः, मरकत, मरतक, श्वसुरः, श्वशुरः, सूकरः - शूकरः, लिपिः - लिबिः (Amara), वाग्भटः - वाहटः, etc. Linguists may be able to describe these sound changes. Several of such words are listed in a special Dictionary for the purposem शब्दभेदप्रकाशिका of Purushottamadeva, a great compiler of various dictionaries with different themes. You can have a look to the list of such words provided in this blog site:
