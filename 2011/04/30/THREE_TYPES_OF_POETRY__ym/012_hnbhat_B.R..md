It is an accepted fact in Paninian Grammar and the metathesis phonetic change in modern linguistics that many such words get interchanged in actual usage. This has been noticed by early lexicographers too. Even Panini has recorded such changes as Mr. Jambunathan observed. I had given to one of such lexicons here. Hence I am not repeating it here.

  

But the wonderful assessment of Paninian Grammar, as unbelievable, when all the Purana-s and Vedic literature is believed as the representatives of Indian culture. But considered as Vedanga, even by the traditionalists, has become today unbelievable for the advanced computations.
