Respected Parvathy Subramanian Mahodayaa,  
  
May I refer to the following paragraph copy-pasted from your mail which you have sent in response to Shri Ramakrishna Mahodaya:  
  
Quote

  
It is a fact acknowledged universally that the word "Dravida" means "

ദിരവം ഉള്ള ഇടം or ദിരവം ചൂഴ്ന്ന ഇടം ; coconut grows well only shores and it is a fruit of the shores of the south - by and large. The word നാര്‍ and the word കേലം has formed the word नारिकेलं ;Interestingly, केला is fruit  
  
Unquote.  

As a favour would you kindly re-write the above paragraph following up the Tamil and Malayalam words withtransliteration (phonetic transcription) using ITRANS or the IPA script? To me, the point youi are trying to make seems too important to let it go un-understood! Thanks and regards,  
...Shreyas

\>Dear Mr. RamaKrishnan,  
\>  
\> Namaskararams,  
\>  
\> Interestingly, you are an etymologist and I am a language researcher.  
\>  
\>**Almost approximately 1000 years ago, the language Malayalam was born**, With old Brahmi script, Tamil, Grantha and Pali and a few more sources - the method of dissecting sounds/phonetics in the form of Sanskrit- i.e**.क ख ग घ** so on, the Malayala Lipi was formed.  
\>  
\>As a language, in Malayalam, if you remove the Sanskrit component of words, the balance words are only Tamil.  
\>  
\>I am also a Malayalee brought up in Tamil Nadu.  
\>  
\>Five years ago, I had been to Panthalam as part of Sabarimala Pilgrimage. In Panthalam, we were guided by one Varma who has connections to the Palace ( where you have the Thiruvabarana petti and so on and so forth....) He casually told us about the many palm leaf manuscripts that are found in the Pooja room among the many Salagrams.
At that time I had not progressed in my knowledge to the level in which I am now. He opened my eyes to a great truth that anyone wants to pursue in Malayalam literature written before 1000 years will land at learning none other than Tamil Literature only-such as Pathitrupathu, Paththupattu, Pathinenkeezhkanakku, Aganannoru, Puranannooru and so on.
He also told us that many people from the University come there to take the manuscripts for reference.  
\>  
\>It is a fact acknowledged universally that the word "Dravida" means "ദിരവം ഉള്ള ഇടം or ദിരവം ചൂഴ്ന്ന ഇടം ; coconut grows well only shores and it is a fruit of the shores of the south - by and large. The word നാര്‍ and the word കേലം has formed the word नारिकेलं ;  
\>Interestingly, केला is fruit .  
\>  
\>The word नारिकेलं which later got metamorphosed into नलिकेरं goes to prove the fact that once----- there was no divide between North and South India and all coexisted peacefully and the foreign invaders have brought into the minds of Indians a sense of division. There are innumerable examples for all these.  
\>  
\>The one letter which is unique for Tamil and therefore for Malayalam is ഴ & ழ .  
\>ह - karam is unique for Sanskrit too. Because of this and many other factors, both the languages grow vertically and horizontally and independently too.  
\>The potential and ability and substance to stand on its own make them be called CLASSIC . In none of these I take to the Tamil Professors of Tamil Nadu who support the DMK stand and write books belittling Sanskrit.  
\>  
\>Thanks,  
\>  
\>With regards,  
\>Parvathy Subramanian,  
\>  
\>A writer whose books are published by Alliance Publications, Mylapore, Chennai, - during a discussion a fortnight ago told me that  
\>the history of India before 1000 years never talks about such divides.  
\>  
\>  
\>  
\>That Parasurama brought Brahmins from different parts of the country and that s how - as what you have mentioned - the different lines of Namboodiris with veedu, illu and manai - I too have heard from Kerala Namboodiris and have read in some texts also.  
\>  
\>I have also understood after reading different Puranas like Halasya Purana that Shiva taught Agastyar Tamil Grammar and there on it has **grown**.  
\>The DNA for Sanskrit and Tamil is one and the same.  
\>  
\>We should look at the **language** and not the **LIPI**. We should look at the subject ***not like*** DK and DMK people look at it. Several words, the archaic words which are totally Indian ( before Muslim invasions and even other invasions)- both the languages - Sanskrit and Tamil will claim as theirs; if you divide and look at them you will never find an answer **:** because both the languages have originated from the same Damaru of Lord Shiva. Mahakavi Bharathi has spoken about this to Aurobindo when Shri Aurobindo wanted a clarification.  
\>  
\>Sage Agastya (Agattiyam is the first Grammar book of Tamil; even before Tholkappiyam).
