Thanks for sharing the delightful classification!



Here is another look:



".......For example, songs and literary works are classified in five groups based on how they are formulated and how easy they are to comprehend, namely as - Narikelapaka, ****Ikshupakam****, Kadalipakam, Drakshapaka and ****Ksheerapakam**** (6). The form most difficult to comprehend is the Narikelapakam - it is like a coconut; to be eaten, the shell must be broken, the fruit grated and then mixed with food. Ikshupakam, is the sugarcane form - which has to be crushed to extract the juice. Next is the Kadalipakam, the banana form which has to be just peeled to be eaten. Easier still is the Drakshapakam - grape form which can be eaten without any processing, and the easiest of all is the Ksheerapakam or the milk form which can not only be easily consumed, but also is a wholesome food for all ages and people in all conditions.



In a similar vein in Sanskrit the literary compositions are classified into three groups: Prabhu samhita, Suhrut Samhita and Kantha Samhita (7). Prabhu Samhita instructs like a Prabhu or master who punishes when rules are transgressed (eg. Instructions such as in the Vedas), Suhrit Samhita instructs like a friend who advises on what to do and what not to do (eg. Like the Puranas), and Kantha Samhitha which instructs like a Kantha or one's beloved who advises and cites examples, coaxes or pleads or persuades as the situation may require to achieve the same end, namely 'upadesa' (eg., as in Kavyam)........."
