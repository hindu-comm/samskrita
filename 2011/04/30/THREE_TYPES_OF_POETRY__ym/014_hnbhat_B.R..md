Thanks for the active discussion on the etymology.

  

By the way, both "mana" and "illam" are the words belonging to the common stock of Dravidian family, some gained prevalence in certain regional speakers with the same meaning. Tamil the oldest language of the group has got both these words and Only the prevalence of usage is made the growing language retain one and other almost lost from one language or transferred meaning in its shade with dialectal difference. This is common fact noticed during the transmission of the word during the centuries.

  

About Naarikela or Nalikera or its cognates nearly 8-9 as noticed by Apte it is the same fact attested by the references in Sanskrit Literature. Kerala is justly popular for growing Kerala and its derivation from Kera+phala is mere derivation for the sake of derivation, even if it can be proved.
