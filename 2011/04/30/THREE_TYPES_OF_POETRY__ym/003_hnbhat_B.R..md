Thanks for further classification and analysis of literature.

  

The Earlier classification is based on the purpose of the poetry and the others are on the quality of the poetry.

  

From the beginning there are two views prevalent: Art for Arts Sake and Art for theology. The literature in General vast in its scope and very fine study is done in every branch of literature. Belles Literature or Literary Art is another realm of aesthetics. Whether it is free from Theology has been subjected to debates over centuries with supporters for both either in West and East too. Aesthetics value is of prime importance for some and for others Theological value is for others.

  

The classification by Mammata taking into consideration the theological aspect into consideration within the scope of literature including Vedic Literature and Epicin broader sense, Hence his classification justifies the goal with theology as the main achievement of Poetry.

  

कान्तासंमिततयोपदेशयुजे - though the goal is common for all these classes. Vedic injunctions are obligatorily followed without violating them, while Purana-s are like a friends advice to persue good things and avoid bad things (ethical value) and the same is achieved by Poetry too in a sweet voice like that of a loving wife that one would not think of neglecting them.

  

There is another another comparison of this concept, कटुकौषधिवत् - like the sugar coated tablets, the advice is coated with sweet "Rasa" in the form of Kaavya-s.  
  

The others are classified with their object of aesthetic value in view, taking into their structure of composition graded. like नारीकेल-पाक etc. The are called पाक-s classified 3 or 5 as suggested by Sundarji by the latter rhetoricians. I think it is Bhoja (10th Century), the author of Shringaraprakasha and Sarasvathikanthabharana, who introduced this classification and championed the aesthetic value of poetry. Later Vidyanatha(12th Cent. AD), extended it so as to include some more classes इक्षुपाक etc.

  

Earlier rhetoricians, emphasized the style. or रीति and गुण-s OF the compositions. and Dandin, even said their difference insuch classification is only minute and it can be enjoyed only than explained.

  

इक्षुक्षीरगुडादीनां माधुर्यस्यान्तरं महत्।  
तथापि न तदाख्यातुं सरस्वत्यापि शक्यते । ।

  

which was quoted by Caraka too in his संहिता-

  

(चरकसंहिता, सूत्रस्थान, २६)

> संस्वादभेदस्तु एकस्याम् अपि मधुरजाताव् इक्षुक्षीरगुडादिगतः > प्रत्यक्षमेव भेदो दृश्यते स तु संस्वादभेदः स्वसंवेद्य एव।  
> यदुक्तम् इक्षुक्षीरगुडादीनां माधुर्यस्यान्तरं महत् ।। १७ ।।  
> भेदस्तथापि नाख्यातुं सरस्वत्यापि शक्यते इति ।। १८ ।।



Then more added on the analogy of edibles to the classification whether it be coconut, banana, honey, or the like for simplification. Another classification based on the suggestio, indication or the function of the words in their broadest sense based on ध्वनि - or Suggestion:

  

उत्तम मध्यम and अधम purely based on aesthetic value and aesthetic experience called रस which is considered as the goal of all the poetry by ध्वनि SCHOOL propounded by Anandavardhanacharya in 9th Century and well established by Abhinavaguptacharya who followed him.

  

Thanks for Ramakrishnan and Sunderji for adding to the topic their observations.
