In Sanskrit literature the language is classified into three types according to the difficulty in finding the meaning - draakshaapaakam, kadaliipaakam, and nalikerapaakam.

  

The first applies to those of which the meaning can be grasped without effort in the sameway the grape can be consumed as it is.

  

The second is like eating the plantain - just remove the skin and eat. A little effort but not

much.

  

The third is very difficult like taking the contents of a coconut. It has two hard covers - thefirst the fibrous one and the second the hard shell. Removing these is a difficult process.

  

I have not come across any authority describing these facts. But I can point outpoeticalcompositions where these are manifest.

  

Kalidasas's compositions can be called draakshaapaaka.

  

Bhartrihari's compositions may be called kadaliipaaka.

  

Bharavi's Kirataarjuniiya would come under the third viz. naalikerapaaka.

  

I was recently listening to the audio of Mallinatha's commentary onKiratarjuniyam. In his introduction he says he is trying to break thecoconut and presenting the substance to panditas.

  

There are many members in this group who are more knowledgeableand I would like to hear their views.
