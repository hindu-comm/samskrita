When I first got Apte's dictionary for students in June,1983, one of the many things that struck me was this word naarikela- he suggests at least 8 variations of the same word with interchanging of ra,la and Da which suggests that when a spoken word gets transcribed, the variations also are obtained for the same word due to different usage and after all,

Maharshi pANinni observed the local usage before systemizing and giving us theunbelievable vyAkaram.
