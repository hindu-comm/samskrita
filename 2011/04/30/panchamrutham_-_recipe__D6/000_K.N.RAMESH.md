Hari OM!

sarvebhyaH namaskaaraH!

Sweet News ! If anyone wants to know how to prepare Pancamrutam please  
watch the YouTube video Shri Vasuvaj ji has refererred to. At the  
end, you will be left wondering whether it is the Panchamrutam that  
tastes sweet or the explanation by the two kids in chaste Samskritam !

The two lads are not from Sringeri or Kanchi nor from Varanasi! They  
are homeraised children in Philadelphia, US. You need to watch the  
video to appreciate how pure and prolific is their diction and  
delivery!

Please do not forget to say a few words of appreciation that will make  
the kids even more enthusiastic and energetic in their study of  
Samskritam!

dhanyavadah Vasuvaj ji!
