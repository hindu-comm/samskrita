Dear Madam,

  

Saw your mail coming before posting this.

I could not get Madhva Bhashya. But I have some idea that the translation of this verse by Chandra Basu notes two different translations . by S and M. Probably S relates to Sankara's interpretation and M relates to Madhva's. Both are differently translated for several words. But there is no list of abbreviations or any introduction in English in the book. The related page is attached.  
  

In the absence of Madhva's bhashya (in original), this may help to know the difference of interpretation. Looks fine.
