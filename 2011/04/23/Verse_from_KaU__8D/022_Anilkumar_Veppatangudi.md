Here is a translation of the Shloka by Valerie Roebuck from her book, 'The Upanishads', Penguin Classics, if it will be of any help:

**Two drink law(Rta) in the world of the good deed,**

**Having entered both the secret place and the utmost height:**

**Knowers of Brahman call them 'shadow' and 'light':**

**So do those with the five fires, and those of three Nachiketa fires.**
