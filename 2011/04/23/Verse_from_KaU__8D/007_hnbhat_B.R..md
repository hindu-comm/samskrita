It is the same bhashya by Srirangaramanujacharya, provided by Sri Sunder as I can see from the view. and not by Sri Ramanjuacharya, the founder of Advaita philosophy.

Both names are not to be confused.

  

I could not find the bhashya-s of Sriramanjuacharya or Sri Madhvacharya on the web. It could have added to the experience of reading and understanding the verse.

  

Here is one Advaita school commentary by one Brahmananda Yogin on the relevant verse attached.
