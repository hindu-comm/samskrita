Bhat Mahodaya

I like that meaning – “hot tea”!!. This will stick in my memory more than “light and shade”.



I am interested in other interpretations – Shankara says there is only one who is “drinking” the good works or own works (karmas) and he gives example of seeing many people on a rainy day with umbrellas but some are not actually carrying umbrellas only they seem to be. If so what or who is the other? The interpretation of the Avaitin parampara of the “two” being individual jivAtmA and paramAtmA cannot be correct philosophically speaking because it suggest a difference between the two – not admitted by Shankara. Edgerton interpreted the “two” as two paths – one taken of by the doers of sukRtas leading to samsAra and the other path taken by the observance of the three-Naciketas fires (explained in a preceding part of KaU) which takes them straight to the “highest” half (the other place).

There is also the difficulty of deciding if both are in the hidden recess of the cave (cave) which **is also** the highest place, or whether one (o the two) goes to the guha and the other goes to the parArdha. This verse is also explicable in SAmkhyA terms – ie the two are the puruSa and the unmanifested prkRtI and also in dualist terms.



This are my thoughts which of course will stand (pUrvapakSa) until corrected by people on this forum.
