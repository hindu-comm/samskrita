As I had suspected, Sri Ramanjuacharya wrote no commentary on Upanishads like Sri Sankara and Madhva. Mostly other Vaishnava- acharya-s too
followed his path, who were content with commenting in Gita itself.

  

Here is a page on the biography and writings of Sri Ramanuja:

  

<http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Ramanuja/ramanuja2.html>

  

Don't know whether it is authentic or not. But it is clearly mentioned in the page that he didn't write any commentary on Upanishad-s.

  

Only Rangaramanjua's one is available to reflect vishishtadvaita philosophy in the Upanishad-s as Sankara did for Advaita and Madhva did for Dvaita.
