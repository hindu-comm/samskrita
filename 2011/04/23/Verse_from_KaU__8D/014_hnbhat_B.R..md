It is not at all a problem. The usage is supported by the similar verse which supports his view that only their oneness is real and the manifest forms other than one are unreal. This is the meaning of Advaita.

  

This Unreality is termed as misconception or मिथ्याध्यवसाय or इतरेतराध्यास . Than the concept of शून्य of Bauddha-s which has no substratum at all while it is the created on on the misconception of real and unreal appearances together. In fact both are the forms of cognition which is generated in one-self. Thats why Bauddha-s call विज्ञानमात्मा. To conform this nihilism to Vedic philosophy, Sankara based this cognition as generated in the Supreme Reality. rajju-sarpa is an instance on the material world. which is also a product of this मिथ्यानृत with the association of self with intellect. And its identity with the ब्रह्म is expounded by Sankara, by twisting many statements to conform to his Advaitic stand. It is the same with Dualistic approach too. If one examines the statements swarming through out the Upanishad-s, one can see all the later thoughts of Indian philosophy are to be traced to their origin to Upanishad-s. One expounding ones theory, will have to make other views in the vast literature, to conform to his view. It is the same with other schools too. YOu can see this in the interpretation of निर्गुण and सगुण concepts of the Supreme Reality taken up by both:

  

According to one, Sankara, निर्गुण (there are many statements to this effects in the vast Upanishad literature) is explained literally as devoid of any attributes, while the others Dvaita, vishisthadvaita restrict the meaning to devoid of demerits (दोषगुण-s). While सगुण statements defend their position of duality, Ishvara and Jeeva as real, one dependent on other, like all the things created by him endow his own qualities, Sankara dismisses the statement as unreal appearance मिथ्याज्ञान. This appearance of sattva, rajas, and tamas could be well explained in Sankhya terms, who too depend on the same verse of Upanishad-s, अजामेकां लोहितशुक्लकृष्णाम् etc. to support their view. To come to our point in question, Sankara's view of interpreting as the archaic use of duel number is only in conformity with the other verse:

  

> द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षं परिषस्वजाते ।  
> तयारन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्यश्रत्रन्यो अभिचाकशीति ॥

  

another place in Upanishad. If one is accepted as correct, the other cannot be defended. So he makes this ऋतं पिबन्तौ to conform to the above quoted verse to maintain the idea similar and again both are unreal अध्यास or confounding the real with unreal things. Likewise, the popular statement --

  

स आत्मा तत् त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो

  

the basic foundation for Advait philosophy identifying the individual soul with The Supreme Real Being (demonstrated by the neuter gender - तत्) is split as

  

स आत्मा, अतत् त्वमसि = He (The Paramatma is real thing) and you are different from The Supreme Being.

  

How is it? This all can be said with a impartial rationalistic view. But all the supporters of the individual schools, would certainly object to this kind of interpretation and each try to make the statements contrary to their view to conform to theirs by hooks and crooks.
Pardons requested from real followers of the orthodox schools of relevant philosophy any in this group. Nothing against their views is propagandized by this writing. Bear with me.

  

In the traditional style, I leave HH Lalithaalaalita, to give satisfactory answer. I gave just my opinion as a standby viewer like you. I too studied Philosophy through the writings Dr.Radhakrishan, Prof. Hiriyanna etc. and didn'nt have traditional learning. But had access to the original works in my own way like you.  
  

Thanks for bringing up the point here.
