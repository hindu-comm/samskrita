Thank you madam for presenting my favorite verse I every day recite before taking छाया with my colleagues.

  

For my purpose, छायातपौ = tea + heat = hot tea, is recommend by those who know. (quoting relevant portion only)  
  

Anyhow, there should be some other commentaries. One of Brahmananda Yogin who has written on 108 Upanishad-s (published from Adyar Library) which is downloadable from [archive.org](http://archive.org). I have downloaded it and can share the related portion with you if you need it. HH. Lalithaalaalita should be having some other commentaries too Anandatirtha and Vidyaranya.You can contact him directly if you are in need of them.There may be many others, we have to look for. He may be already aware of them.

  

With regards
