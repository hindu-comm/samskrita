नमो नमः "विमला शर्मा"-महोदये !  
एषः तु गहनविषयः । "गुरुदेव रानडे" इति विख्यातैः तत्त्वज्ञानिभिः संतमहाभागै: तेषां "Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy" इति ग्रन्थे निम्नमिव व्याख्या प्रदत्ता अस्ति -  
".... the development of the idea of the relation of the "Two Souls", the Individual Soul and the Universal Soul, which occurs in कठोपनिषत् , मुण्डकोपनिषत् and the श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषत् could be regarded as a legitimate test for the chronological sequence of these Upanishads in that order, in as much as in the story of the कठोपनिषत् the two souls are regarded as being on a par with each other as enjoying equally the fruits of their action, while in मुण्डक only one is described as tasting the fruits of the action, the other being described simply as an onlooker, while finally in श्वेताश्वतर an addition is made to the concept in the मुण्डक, namely that of the unborn प्रकृति, consisting of the three qualities, the red, the white and the black, which the individual soul enjoys, but which the Universal Soul leaves off (S.7)...."
