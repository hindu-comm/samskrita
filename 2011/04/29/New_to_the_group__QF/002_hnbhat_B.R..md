Dear Friend,

  

Welcome to your questions. Certainly they will be answered by somebody who first come to read them.  
  

You can always ask questions related to Sanskrit Language and Literature, or Grammar or anything related to Sanskrit.

  

You may try to type in your sentences in Sanskrit itself for practicing whatever little you have learnt. Never mind, if any error occurs. Its only a justified way of learning, trial and error. Even if you type in English, you will certainly get answers if you are precise and clear in your questions.

  

Thanks and wish you happy stay in the group.
