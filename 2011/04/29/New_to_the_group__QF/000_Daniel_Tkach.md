Hari Om! Please accept my humble obeisances!

I just joined this forum hoping to learn about the sanskrit language. I bought the first course from Samskrita Bharati and I've been studying it for some time. I have a couple of grammar question but I wasn't able to find anyone that can help me out. Would this be a good please to ask about grammar and vocabulary?

Thank you very much.
