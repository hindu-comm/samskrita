Desr Sri Kolhatkar Mahodaya,  
  
You seem to be confusing "Old" with "Original". Of course, Sanskrit cannot be mother of "all" languages (like the native american languages!).  
  
The discovery of a spoken language going as far as 100000 years is wonderful. It goes to show that humans were fairly advanced (at least mentally) in that age.  
  
Among (Indo-European) languages still spoken, Sanskrit does seem to be the oldest (second comes Lithuanian). But it need not have been the "original language". Note that old and original are very different things. Linguists have reconstructed the original language (Proto-Indo-European) from which other languages emerged using certain criteria. Although these criteria are not flawless, Sanskrit does face difficulties in being the "original language". Whatever the antiquity of Sanskrit (spanning manvantaras or whatever) it can always be claimed that PIE existed before that! there is absolutely no evidence to set the "not earlier than" limit on the existance of PIE (not to mention that we dont even know whether it was ever spoken). But there **is** a "not later than" limit, which goes back to \< 3000 BC. (c.f Talageri's books). Thus it is a welcome discovery that language spead from Africa 100000 years ago!
