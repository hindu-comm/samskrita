Dear Group,

  

Competition has emerged for Sanskrit as the 'firstest' language of the world and therefore the 'mother' of all languages, as is sometimes claimed. This makes the confused picture worse confounded!

  

Please see<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1377150/Every-language-evolved-single-prehistoric-mother-tongue-spoken-Africa.html?ito=feeds-newsxml>

  

If you want know more about this, enter -as I did- search terms in Google as \<Dr Quentin Atkinson African language> and watch the fun.
This 'African' claim goes back to a hundred thousand years so our work is now cut out. We must find - and failing that, invent - evidence that Sanskrit goes back that far. 

  

The tough get going when the going gets tough!
