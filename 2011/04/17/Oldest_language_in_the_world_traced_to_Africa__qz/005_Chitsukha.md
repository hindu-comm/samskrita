Namaste,  
  
To add a few words to this discussion..  
  
I could not read the full original paper. From some of the reports  
accessible on the web it seems Sanskrit is not included in the 504  
languages analysed by the author. It would be really strange if that  
is the case.  
  
On phonological anaIysis of Sanskrit words, I found this paper by  
Prof. Brian D. Joseph (home page is: <http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~bjoseph/>  
) (by Google search)  
  
<http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~bjoseph/publications/2002sktmisanalyzed.pdf>
