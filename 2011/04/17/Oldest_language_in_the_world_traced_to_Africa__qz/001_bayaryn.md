Namaste,  
I don't think that the number of phomemes is really a criteria of "firstness" as it seems from that article and that this question can be at all solved whithin historical world view at all, but the number of Sanskrit phoneme is also no so small - 174 - (a-18 i-18 u-18 R-18 L-12 e-12 ai-12 o-12 au-12 aM-1 aH1 ka-ma-25 y-2 r-1 l-2 v-2 z-1 S-1 s-1 h-1 f-1 x-1) :)
