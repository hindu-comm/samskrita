I think this is not a reply to the question "how one should treat one's guru's parents?" There is a lot of wise sayings in the upanishad-s, as in this except the direct references to guru in teaching process and parents in one's progeny.

  

```
 १. अथाधिविद्यम् । आचार्यः पूर्वरूपम् ॥ २ ॥ अन्तेवास्युत्तररूपम् । विद्या सन्धिः । प्रवचनँ  सन्धानम् । इत्यधिविद्यम् ।
```

``` २. अथाधिप्रजम् । माता पूर्वरूपम् ।पितोत्तररूपम् । प्रजा सन्धिः । प्रजननँ  सन्धानम् । इत्यधिप्रजम् ॥ ३ ॥ ```

I think it is a general prescription or description of the process of learning and lineage.

  
Then, should you have any doubt with regard to duties or customs, you should behave in those matters just as Brahmanas do, who may happen to be there and who are able deliberators, who are adepts in those duties and customs, who are not directed by others, who are not cruel, and who are desirous of merit.

  

Hope the above will be a direct answer to his question if he is really asking the question in the sense described in the portion. This is after his following the general conduct prescribed in the earlier portions.
