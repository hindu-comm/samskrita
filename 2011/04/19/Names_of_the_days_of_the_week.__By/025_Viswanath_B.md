namOnamaH shrI abhyaMkar mahodaya,  
  
Good question on what would be a day at North Pole :-).  
  
on a lighter vein, i wish i was there, since that means i can do one sandhya-vandana every 2 months and still cover all the three mandatory sandhya-vandana in a day :-).  
  
I will try to get the other definitions of the day, and post back to this forum. I will also try and post the other 'mAna' being mentioned.  
  
Thanks  
viswanath
