The explanation given here is bizarre.

  

When the Greeks formulated the week system, they assumed that the universe

was geocentric and there were 7 planets moving around the earth. In the order of

speed with which they were circling the earth they were Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,

Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon - seven in number. The day was divided into 24

horas or hours. Theyassigned lordship of each hour in the above order.
They

named the day on the basis of the planet who ruled the first hour of the day. The first day of the week therefore became Saturday.Sincethere are 24 hours and 7 planets the ruler of the first hour of the next day becomes Sun. And so on.

At that time they had not discovered Uranus and Neptune. If they had, the week

would have been of 9 days instead of 7.
