Good question raised.

There is no concept of 7 days week in Indian system of measurement of time as attested by the testimony of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Vedic rites too are performed on certain days or the "tithi-s. This system as I know from Amarakosha is given below up to year:

  

> ( १. ४. २७२) अष्टादश निमेषास्तु काष्टा त्रिंशत् तु ताः कला 30 Kala = > Kshana, 12 Kshana = Muhurta ( १. ४. २७३) तास्तु त्रिंशत् क्षणस्ते तु > मुहूर्तो द्वादशाऽस्त्रियाम् 30 Muhurta = (Full) day (24 Hours), 15 > Days = Paksha (fortnight) ( १. ४. २७४) ते तु त्रिंशदहोरात्रः पक्षस्ते > दशपञ्च च First and second fortnight, 2 fortnights = (Lunar) Month ( १. > ४. २७५) पक्षौ पूर्वाऽपरौ शुक्लकृष्णौ मासस्तु तावुभौ Two months = Ritu > (season), 3 Ritus = Ayana (Semester) ( १. ४. २७६) द्वौ द्वौ मार्गादि > मासौ स्यादृतुस्तैरयनं त्रिभिः 2 Ayana = Year, Equinox ( १. ४. २७७) > अयने द्वे गतिरुदग्दक्षिणाऽर्कस्य वत्सरः ( १. ४. २७८) समरात्रिदिवे काले > विषुवद्विषुवं च तत् Constellation names determine names for Full moon > days and their months For example, Pushya constellation names Paushi > full moon night and Pausha month.

  

  

Now it is clear how year can be counted even without the concept of 7 days week as per measurement of time in the system given above.

  

The word होरा is recorded in Amarakosha, used in the sense of Lagna and Jaataka. (3.5.10).

  

Now it should be clear that there is no need of the concept of 7 days week. As suggested by some in earlier posts, the naming of the days of the week, is also not recorded in Amarakosha which was composed as early as c. 500 AD. It may be the influence of contact with Greek and Persian astronomers, that such a system was adopted. But some have suggested it as started by Aryabhata, named after the governing plannet. I am not sure of it. Even though a word सप्ताह is used to translate seven day week, it is used to denote a sacrifice extending to seven days. It goes up to द्वादशवार्षिक satra-s. (Uttararamacarita). But no word to denote English 7 days week than in modern usage translating the week. Like the word दिनाङ्क used to denote date of the month, I had mentioned in another topic on the related question.

  

Ramakrishnan had already mentioned this in his earlier message and he has reinstated in his recent message too the same view.

  

The number of 14 years has a different significance, that after 14 years of exile, one is not entitled to his property (inherited from generation) as he looses his right after that. I cannot confirm with the authority, but this was the reason, as I had read somewhere, why Kaikeyi asked 14 years excile of Srirama and the same with

  

  

Here is the exact limit of 14 years:

  

yo dvitiiyo varo deva dattaH priitena me tvayaa \|\| 2-11-25  
tadaa daivaasure yuddhe tasya kaalo.aya maagataH \|  
  
25. tasya= for it, ayam= this, kaalaH= time, aagataH= has come, yaH= for which, dvitiiya varaH= second boon, dattaH= is given, me= to me, priitenaa= affectionately, tvayaa= by you, taada= then, daivaasurayuddhe= in the battle between celestials and demons.  
  
"Now, the time has arrived for the second boon given by you affectionately then in the battle between celestials and demons."  
  
Verse Locator  

नव पञ्च च वर्षाणि दण्डकारण्यमाश्रितः ॥ २-११-२६

चीराजिनजटाधारी रामो भवतु तापसः ।

  
26. raamaH= Rama, aashritaH= has to take refuge, daNdakaaranyam= in the forest of Dandaka, nava paJNcha cha varshhaNi= for fourteen years, bhavatu taapasaH= let him become ascetic, chiiraajiina jataadhaarii= wearing rags, deer skin and matted hair.  
  
"Rama has to take refuge in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years and let him become an ascetic wearing rags, deer skin and matted hair".  

  

I could not find anything that why she asked 14 years exactly and also could find any reference to the return of Rama exactly after 14 years. But here you can find Rama sends a message to Bharata on his way back to Ayodhya after accomplishing his mission:

  

<http://www.valmikiramayan.net/yuddha/sarga125/yuddha_125_frame.htm>

  

After living for fourteen years in the forest and after the death of Ravana, Rama was returning to Ayodhya along with Lakshmana, Sugreeva and various other attendants. On the way, He reached the ashram of Bharadwaja. Rama knew very well the agony in the mind of Bharatha. Rama knew that if he delayed even a little beyond fourteen years, Bharatha would probably enter fire and destroy himself. So, Rama sent Hanuman in advance to Bharatha to tell him about his impending arrival. When Hanuman reached Nandigrama and told Bharatha that Rama was coming, Bharatha was overjoyed and was in ecstasy, and he quickly made all arrangements in Ayodhya for the reception of Rama. He called Sumantra and asked for his chariot to be brought. This chariot was placed on the outskirts of Ayodhya and Bharatha was awaiting anxiously for Rama.

  

I could not fine the source for the assumption, though I too had read somewhere of the pledge by Bharata, that even if he delays a little beyond the stipulated period of years, he would enter fire and destroy himself. I could not locate the reference in Ramayana.

  

Hope somebody will make available. Anyhow, I think this question is not related at all with the concept of 7 days a week as explained in the beginning of the message its self-sufficiency of counting in the indigenous system itself without it. The same with the question related with the exile of Pandava-s both अज्ञातवास and वनवास. It was the difference of calculation of the completion of year that Pandava-s gained benefit on Gograhana. (If my memory is right).
