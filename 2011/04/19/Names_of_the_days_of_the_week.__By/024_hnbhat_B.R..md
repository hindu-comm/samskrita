Thanks for the elaborate thesis. But not comments. Even if you insist on any thing like that, reasoning need not any religious shraddha, but devotion to reasoning. Whether you call reasoning, as श्रद्धाम् मेधा, यशः, प्रज्ञा, which are requested by offering oblation to Fire by Vedic people.

I think I need not quoted the line, for you.

  

I have seen the shift of chronology, even postponing the date of Sri Sankara, two Ashoka Maurya-s, two Chandra Gupta-s are presented by the supporter of the chronologies. It is not worse than pushing the date of Veda-s to Brahma-s mouth, to be the ancient language as I have seen in some post. The "shruti" itself can be quoted.

Even if it it post Varahamihira, why the name of "vara" doesn't find place even in any of the literature of the later period of 2000 years? The question is the same. The only answer is that they were not interested in listing the name, while all the lexicons listed names of tithi,, paksha,masa, rutu, ayana and even sixty samvatsara-s. Nor any name is given corresponding to week, even if we accept it as emerging back about 2000 years? The question is the same and your all round exercise gets not out of the pit, but inside the pit itself.
