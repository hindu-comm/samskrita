Dear Group,

  

Does one ever pause to think why the days of the week have the arrangement that they have? Why does Monday follow Sunday and Tuesday follow Monday and so on? I believe that, leaving a small number who are knowledgeable about the evolution of Astronomy in the Ancient World, scarcely anyone would know the answer or would have even thought of this as a meaningful question to ask. The arrangement of the days of the week is so much a part of us, that we almost never ask the question why it is so. This is a kind of ‘useless knowledge’, defined as something that is totally unnecessary but which makes life cheerful. I did not know the answer myself till I chanced upon the explanation on p.137 in the Marathi authoritative book called ’भारतीय ज्योतिःशास्त्र अथवा भारतीय ज्योतिषाचा प्राचीन आणि अर्वाचीन इतिहास’ by शंकर बाळकृष्ण दीक्षित, published in 1896. I do hope the members of the Group too will enjoy knowing it.



The names of 7 heavenly bodies that (apparently) rotate around the Earth are arranged thus in the descending order of their periods of rotation: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon. Each of these, in turn and in this sequence, is held as the ‘Swami’ of an hour in a day.
As a result, if a day starts with the Saturn as the ‘Swami’ of its first hour, the Sun will be the ‘Swami’ of the first hour of the next day and so on. Thus, the ‘Swamis’ of the first hours of successive days, starting from the Saturn, will be Saturn, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn again. The cycle goes on. The days are named after the ‘Swami’ of its first hour and hence the sequence familiar to us as Saturday, Sunday, Monday etc.

  

According to the Author, the names of the days of the week are not found in the Vedas, but appear in Vedanga Jyotish, for which he gives 1500 BC as the earliest time limit. The Indian system of the weekdays can be said to be no more than 3,500 years old.

  

Not surprisingly, only a few websites have attempted to explain the above. The Wikipedia article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week-day_names> makes a mention of this, though not quite in the same manner. After some effort, I came across the site <http://www.friesian.com/week.htm> that gives a good account of it.
