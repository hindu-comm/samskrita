Namaskar,

What i am intrigued is why did both eastern and western civilisation  
adopt a seven day week? Indians have followed lunar calender since  
vedic times which is roughly 30 days long. These days are calculated  
as tithis which is a lunar day, or the time it takes for the  
longitudinal angle between the moon and the sun to increase by 12°.  
Tithis begin at varying times of day and vary in duration from  
approximately 19 to approximately 26 hours - source Wikipedia  
Since we now know a earth year is more than 365 days, in vedic time a  
30 day month takes approximately 360 days in a year. The additional  
time is adjusted once in four years through Adhikmaas.

Logically Indian week should have been 15 days long from Pratipada to Poornima  
and Pratipada to Amavasya, what was the motivating factor to limit it  
to 7 days? Wikipedia gives details of tithis and the presiding deity  
of the day.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithi>

Also our year is roughly 360 days long, which is not divisible by 7,  
hence a seven day week does not fit the calculation.

In earlier mails it was mentioned that both Ramayana and Mahabharata  
do not mention names of week or measurement of time, then how do we  
justify 14 years of Vanavas of Shri Rama and 18 days Mahabharata war,  
or one year incognito stay of Pandava, are the time frame latter  
addition?

It is a bit too much of a coincidence that Shri Rama defeated Ravana  
and came back to Ayodhya exactly at the end of 14 year period, there  
is no mention that his Vanavas was exactly 14 years or more/less.

If someone can throw more light on this.

Pranama
