I was just observing as a stander by. Everything is OK. Each of the west and east claiming their system perfect concentrated on finding fault with other system.

  

I am not any engineer or astronomer or scientist to or Vaidka strictly speaking to verify the claim. But a simple question haunted me from the beginning. ThoughTithi, Vara, Nakshatra, Yoga and Karana are the five basic elements of Pancha-anga  

while Tithi and Nakshatra are commonly known and referred to widely in Sanskrit Literature, why the names of the 7 days Vara,(?) does not find place in any lexicon or even in Mahabharata, Valmiki Ramayana, or the other works of Kalidasa and other poets? While "Ashtami" tithi, and "RohiNi" nakshatra are associated with Krishna's birth, no mention is made of the other elements of the day? At least, the name of the day of the week while describing his naamakaraNa ceremony by Garga probably in his Gargasamhita? If so mentioned, why only the Tithi is associated with Krishna Janma Ashtami. and RohiNi as the wife of Balarama? Any idea? Or any reference to Parasharasamhita listing the names of the week as we know today through Panchanga ?

  

While the name of Tithi (15), paksha (2), masa (12), Ritu (6), Ayana (2) and Samvatsara (60) are popularly known by their names everywhere in literature, why the name of the week days do not find place anywhere in the literature Vedic and Classical? Probably some astrological works may have a list of the seven days, if so can I be enlightened of the source? At present it finds place in Panchanga in every Saka, or system of Idian Era. What may be the reason justifiable? Was it not important for literature? If not, whence the Panchanga system started including within its scope Vara, along with Yoga and KaraNa? Or is this system limited in its use to astrological/astronomical works? Even then, while होरा listed in the earliest Lexicon Amara, the three others are not enlisted. Yoga and Karana need not be the part of the measurement of time. But week days 7 form the week, which is not seen named as a single name, like paksha, maasa etc. Only a term frequently found is सप्ताह which literally means a period of seven days. No lexicon has recorded it as part of the Paksha, divided into 15 tithi-s (or days of the month).

  

Thanks for the debate on the names of the week for all who participated.
