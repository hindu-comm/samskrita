Dear friends,

Present-day scholarly consensus on the origin of the 7-day week naming  
system is Akkadian (not Greek), pre-dating the Romans or the Greeks or  
even the Semitic Babylonians, Assyrians, or Israelites (3000 BC to  
1500 BC, <http://www.sacred-texts.com/evil/hod/hod06.htm>). Akkadians,  
Sumerians (Sumeru), Assyria (asura, assUraya, asUrya?), and Mittani  
(Mitra) were contemporary to the Vedic people.

According to Wiki, "the Ptolemaic system asserts that the order of the  
heavenly bodies, from the farthest to the closest to the Earth, is:  
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. (This order was  
first established by the Greek Stoics.)" But this was some 1000 years  
after the Akkadians, and as we all know, it is wrong too!

For the Greeks or later the Romans (1st - 3rd century AD) and the  
Europeans through Copernicus time (1473-1543), the sequence of the  
week-days was not based on their relative rotational (i.e., on-axis)  
or revolutional speeds, but on what was pictured as the distance of  
their circular paths in the celestial sphere, with a ‘flat Earth as  
the firm center’. It is highly doubtful if Greece or Rome  
independently developed the week naming system. Also for the Roman  
mind, the first hour of the day began at sunset, following Greek and  
Babylonian convention. Would an originator of the hora system have  
counted the sunset hour as the first hora and the beginning of the  
day, when night actually begins?

For comparison, the hora naming in India's Jyotisha even now commences  
with sunrise and there is no evidence to the contrary in ancient India  
as well. The Garga Samhita dated 1st Century BC, refers to the seven-  
day week, Aditya to Shani. The grahas, their adhi devatas, pratyadhi  
devatas, etc. were well established in the Vedic lore (navagraha  
mantras). There is a thread from these to the nakSatrESti to the Rik  
root svastinOmimItAm sUktam through the devatas. Mere Samskrita  
meanings won’t do (dukr\`njikaraNE), their import and viniyOga also  
must be examined to draw proper conclusions. We see no such depth and  
detail of the spiritual panorama of the cosmos in ancient Rome or  
Semitic nations. It is an amusing opinion that the 7-day week system’s  
source idea was borrowed from Greece or Rome and then quickly  
developed to elaborate rituals somewhere in a Punjab forest by a few  
Vedic sages.

Moreover, in Jyotisha, its sequence is not based on the "order of  
their periods of rotation: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury  
and Moon." The basis instead is the apparent speeds of the 'graha's as  
seen from the Earth (a graha is not a 'planet', Samskrita scholars in  
this group may know the difference).

Amusingly, after claiming the Greeco-Roman "origin" of the seven-day  
week naming, the wiki entrant notes,

"Though the explanation on the sequence of the name is only available  
in ancient texts in India, which goes as: The division of days among  
the planets was done based on the speed of each planet as perceived  
from earth.... The sequence based on speed is Moon, Mercury, Venus,  
Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn."

We now know that this sequence is astronomically and scientifically  
correct. Naturally, since this scheme is based on the observable  
apparent speeds of the grahas, lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu (or Mandi,  
another invisible node) do not figure in the sequence of the hora-  
adhipatya. Further, beyond the seven visible + the two nodes, all  
other grahas were discarded by Parasara as irrelevant for life on the  
Earth. This Parasara was Veda Vyasa’s father; according to tradition,  
his time was about 3000 BC.

There are still bizarre notions in the West such as, "If you order the  
"planets" according to either their presumed distance from Earth  
(assuming the Earth to be the center of the universe) or their period  
of revolution around the Earth, you arrive at this order: Moon,  
Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn." These ideas are all  
scientifically wrong.

The cultural and linguistic similarities among the Akkadians,  
Sumerians, Mittanis (Mitra people), and the Vedic people (3000 BC -  
1500 BC) point to the very early origin and adoption of the seven-day  
week naming method and system among them. That this is from the Greeks  
or the Romans or the Jews, or that Indians borrowed it from the  
Greeks, etc. is all 18th century Euro-centric scholars' opinions  
revealing their cultural bias. Even in their early works (H. H.  
Wilson, Colebrook, etc.), all we see repeatedly is "it is evidently  
borrowed from the Greeks" but there is no scientific evidence in their  
works to support such hypothesis.

A last note: Wiki refers to David Pingree (1933-2005) who asserted  
that 'hora' in Brihat Parasara Horasastra is from the Greeks, a line  
asserted way back by Wilson. Pingree was no astronomer or  
mathematician or Samskrit scholar but wrote volumes about India's  
ancient astronomy and mathematics. He was a missionary who later  
became a professor at Brown University, and was merely continuing the  
line drawn by Wilson. USA social science scholars now recognize that  
the 18-20th century Euro-centric work is highly tainted due to the  
then scholars’ cultural bias and a mission to aid in empire building.  
(It is like the WMD in Iraq - this mission still exists, in another  
form.) Pretty much nothing asserted in their work has been  
scientifically established, though repetitions of those primitive  
assertions are galore as “education”, particularly by the India’s  
English-only “educated” who don’t check the primary sources! It is  
indeed a chuckling reading to read Wilson, Colebrook, Jones, Max  
Mueller, etc., particularly if one is a practicing Vaidika,  
understands the mantras, vidhis, and their viniyOgas, and lives the  
tradition.

I may be faulted for straying from the group's Samskrita focus, but  
the above comments and several other threads force me to beg to  
differ.

By the way, for introducing myself, I am from a village Vaidika family  
with a bit of practice of the tradition who got into Electrical  
Engineerig, Americana, PhD, and all the associated trappings due to  
blind fascination and, once fully in the trap, for udara nimittam.  
Late in life, I see that all this diversion has been a waste of life -  
now trying to get out of the damn trap.
