Hi Shambhu,  
  
I have a slight different perspective on specific topics mentioned by you.  
  
Both nakShaktrEsthi and navagraha mantras including the vidhana do not seem to refer to the seven day of the week.  
  
the vedanga jyothisha also doesn't seem to refer to the seven day week.  
  
The current model followed from our daily samkalpa - 'asmin vartamAna vyAvahArika chAndramAnEna -. This chAndramAnA is the one that introduced the seen day week, in the best of my knowledge. There are other methods, bArhaspatya mAna etc, that work differently. all our panChamga follow the chandramAna these days apparently.  
  
There seemed to be three definitions for a day, we follow the simplest one (from a panchaMga perspective) - sUryOdayAt suryOdayam.  
  
There was a discussion specifically on the 'vArA' (as in monday/tuesday/....) , in an astro magazine, and specific inputs were sought from vedic scholars regarding references to the 'vArA' in any vedic scriptures. Its observed that no references exist in any of the known shakhAH, but this leaves open the possibility that it may be there in a shakhA that none of us know today.  
  
Thanks  
viswanath
