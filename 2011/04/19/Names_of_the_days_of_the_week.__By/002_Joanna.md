Arvind,



The English day names came from the Roman gods. The gods were named afterof those sameplanets and in the same order as given in the Indiansources.



The question is, did the basic idea arise independently or have a single source?





Interesting question though.





Here's the story according to the Romans:

Where do the names of the days of the week come from?

In English, we call our days of the week after Saxon gods, apart from Saturday. The French call their days of the week after Roman gods. But the Saxon and Roman gods who look after the same day are the same type of god.

The English 'Saturday' is called after a Roman god, not a Saxon one. In Scandinavia, the word for Saturday is Lördag or Lørdag. It is an ancient word meaning "bath". Apparently the Vikings took one bath a week and it was on Saturday, so they called it "bath day". Perhaps the Saxons didn't like baths, so they preferred to use the Roman day name!
