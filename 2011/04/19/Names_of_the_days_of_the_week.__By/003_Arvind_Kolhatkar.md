Joanna,  
  
There are several conjectures as to how the system of associating  
names of weekdays with heavenly bodies began. The source is often  
attributed to the Babylonians, though not all agree with it. For  
more, please see the site <http://www.friesian.com/week.htm>.  
  
Though the practice of naming weekdays after the heavenly bodies in  
the respective languages is quite common, it is by no means uniform.  
I know for a fact that the Russian weekdays are called понедельник  
вторник среда четверг пятница суббота воскресенье i.e. first day of  
the week, second day of the week, middle day, fourth day, fifth day,  
sabbath day, day of the rising (of Jesus Christ). This is probably  
accounted for by the fact that the Slavs in southern Russia came into  
the mainstream far later than than other cultures, almost around the  
turn of the first millennium and did not borrow anything from ancient  
civilizations. Their main source of guidance was the Byzantium.  
  
Indian days are, of course, all named after the heavenly bodies.
