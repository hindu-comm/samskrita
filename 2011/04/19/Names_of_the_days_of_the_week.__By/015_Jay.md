Lunar cycle is closer to 28 days. 28 is multiple of 7 and hence two week cycles in each Paksh.  
  
The sky is devided in 27 Nakshatras to match movement of moon. As many of you may be aware, name of the months are based on Nakshatra in which the moon rises on Pratipada.  
  
Kruttika, Mrigshirsha, Pushya, Magha, Falguni, Chitra, Vishakha, Jyeshtha, Ashadh, Shravan, Bhadrapada and Ashwini are the Nakshatra names to base month names on.  
  
  
Following is from Wikipedia  
  
The Moon exhibits different phases as the relative position of the Sun, Earth and Moon changes, appearing as a full moon when the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of the Earth and as a new moon ([dark moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_moon)) when they are on the same side. The phases of full moon and new moon are examples of[syzygies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy "Syzygy"), which occur when the Earth, Moon, and Sun lie (approximately) in a straight line. The time between two full moons (a[Lunar month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month)) is about 29.53 days^([\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase#cite_note-gore1996-0))(29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes) on average (hence, the concept of the timeframe of an approximated month was derived). This[synodic month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_month "Synodic month")is longer than the[time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period")it takes the Moon to make one orbit around the Earth with respect to the fixed stars (the[sidereal month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_month "Sidereal month")), which is about 27.32 days.^([\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase#cite_note-gore1996-0))This difference is caused by the fact that the Earth-Moon system is orbiting around the Sun at the same time the Moon is orbiting around the Earth.
