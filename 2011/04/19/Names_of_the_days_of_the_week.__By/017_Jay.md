Actually bizarre word should be used for basing the discussion on 7 planet theory.  
  
Indian system always believed that there are 9 Grahas/ planets, NOT 7, and included Rahu and Ketu. Even the Stutis are for Navgrahas. And it went to even precisely calculating and predicting movements of them and timing of Grahans.  
  
Again, sticking out neck at risk of being called bizarre again, here is the explanation of how they did. Orbits of Sun and Moon anre at slight anngle. Think of two bangles kept together at an angle touching at top and bottom. These points of intersect or overlap are two virtual Planets. When Sunb or Moon reaches that point, it gets overlapped by the other. That is Grast by Rahu or Ketu and hence Grahan.
