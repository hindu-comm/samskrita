Dr. Bhat ji, namO namaH.



I think the confusion arises from the chronologies of associated texts and personalities. In all the traditional texts, Shri Krishna, Vyasa, Parasara, or the mahAbhArata were in the 3000-BC time frame. rAmAyaNa (Adi kAvya) of Valmiki was 2000-3000 years before that (purANas note the 65 generations between mahAbhArata's Br\`hadbala and rAmAyaNa's Shreeraama). Vikramaditya of the Vikrama shaka was a real heroic king who’s Era gives his time. Varaha Mihira was one of his court navaratnas, along with Kalidasa. Adi Shankara was in 600 BC time-frame (not 7th century AD). Alexander's encounter was with a Chandragupta (Sandrakotus) of the Gupta dynasty, and not with the Maurya Chandragupta. This sheet anchoring of Sandrakotus with the Maurya is the central mischief of the 18th century Indologists. With this about 1000-year shift in chronology, everything Indicneatly fell as post-Greece. It was an essential element of the empire-building mission ("having done the material conquest of India, complete it by its intellectual conquest" - you may objectively study Max Mueller's *Life and Letters*, edited by his wife, available here <http://www.archive.org/details/lifelettersofrig01mluoft> and see it). We won't see themischeif by being biased or superficial; we need to critically and with no bias or ill will study Colebrooke, Wilson, Jones, Max Mueller etc. Somewhere around Max Mueller's time, the mischief was declared as the truth, not likely or solely by him, but by the force of his British masters. All the authors of the "Sacred Books of the East" series (Max Mueller was simply its editor and contributed only a little to it) worked under a massive and funded British scheme with an empire-building purpose. "Uplifting India" was smokescreen to the Brahmo Samajis at best but that is what we all learnt in the school and still happily believe -:)Whatever good happened was most likely a side effect, not the main show. The show is in fact going on.



Of course, this needs unbiased research, not this side or that side debate. When we take the traditional sources seriously for deciding the chronology, explain the few inconsistencies (they are similar to what is seen in the Greek sources) along with other evidences such as archeology and coinage, I think a clear picture may emerge. This is tentative in my mind: the panchAnga scheme arose post Garga, around Kalidasa/Varaha Mihira times, i.e., not later than about 2000 years ago. The second point is: kAlagaNanA is part and parcel of almost all Vedic rituals and it would be the focus of the paddhatis, re-invigorated by Adi Shankara, and not of any other Samskritam literary work. I wonder if the vAsara is mentioned even in the sAyaNa BhAShya, or in bANa, Bhatti, harSha, etc. As Vishwanath ji noted, vAsara systematically appears in the sankalpa, and the research question is: When and where did this sankalpa scheme originate?



My thesis is long, nonetheless, I find that the vAsara scheme is post-Garga, pre-Varaha Mihira, i.e., no latter than 2000 years ago, i.e. it is pre-Roman.



Again, to repeat, this needs serious, unbiased, original research digging into the traditional sources and rituals, not for aiding empires of one kind or another or labeling A or B as political or for scoring silly points but to know the true history of mankind and its past. Let us study and keep in mind what the Euro-centric scholars have written and still insist upon (A nO bhadrA kratavO...!), but not necessarily accept them as true or final without critically checking their work. This critical scrutiny of European works and those authors on India is still missing. The children of the finest exponents of nyAya, tarka, and pramANa have lost their bearing - let us reclaim it.



In parellel, a genuine study of India's lore and ritualsis also needed to figure out what the truth of the past was. By dubbing them like a Jha of the "meat eating in the Vedas" fame, may he rest in peace, we won't get anywhere but as another Charvaka. Sincere questioning must be there along with genuine shraddhA as we witness in the Upanishads (ex: Nachiketa, Bhrugu, etc.): without seeking shraddhA, mEdhA, and prajnA in oneself, there is no hope of attaining any vidyA or mOkSha. All we may have otherwise is "anDham tamaH pravishanti...". As you know, the upanayanam is the beginning of seeking the grace of these three dEvatAs. Since you are all Samskrita scholars, it will be great to post educational comments on these three sUktas.
