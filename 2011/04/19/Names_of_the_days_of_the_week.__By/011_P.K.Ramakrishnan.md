Indians call the 15-day interval amavasya to poornima and poornima to amavasya  
as paksha- further distinguishing the same sukla paksha and krishna paksha.

Indians did not have weekdays as I have already quoted P.V.Kane.

The week started from Greek. They had at that time noticed that there were 7  
planets going round the earth. And they assigned lordship of the days to these  
planets. At that point of time the planets Uranus and  
Neptune had not been discovered. Had they been discovered the  
week would have been of 9 days. I have already quoted P.V.Kane  
mentioning that week days are not mentioned in Ramayana or  
Mahabharata. -----------------------------------
