Dear Friends  
On a slightly different topic, it is interesting to me that although in the Vedic period and beyond, they had a good sense of time - ie meters in the chants (matras for each syllable) , things that need to be done at particular times of the day, month, seasons and year, and so on, and when particular festivals needed to be celebrated, and they also had a good knowledge of the placement of stars and planets etc at particular times, they did not have any system for numbering the years (samvatsara) so nothing is dated. We have to rely on foreigners - Chinese pilgrims, Kushanas and Greeks etc for dates. Even the Asokan edicts were not dated, although the inscriptions include statements like "in the 12th year after his coronation (his reign)".
