Namaste, dear group members  
  
I'm glad to introduce new Devanagari Unicode font - Siddhanta. The font supports new Vedic encoding and many ligatures and variations. It is freely availbale here - <http://svayambhava.org/index.php/en/sanskrit/fonts> - or by direct link - <http://siddhanta.svayambhava.org/siddhanta.ttf>  
  
I hope Sanskrit lovers will appreciate this work (it took three years to complete it).  
  
With best regards,  
Mhail Bayaryn
