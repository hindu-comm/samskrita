Like most Hindus, I would also like to take pride in saying that we Hindus invented the zero; but precisely because I am a Hindu, I have a greater responsibility. Responsibility of remaining objective and honest and of giving credit to others where (and if)it is rightly deserved by them.  
  
My submission is that the shunya as a concept, phonetically expressed, was surely 'invented' by the ancient Hindus but the zero as a graphic symbol was perhaps invented by the arabs...Egyptians at that. The arabic symbol for zero is a dot "." which is the closest graphic representation of the shunya concept...no length, no breadth,symbolically occupying no area, Against this, the small circle "O" used by Europeans and the Hindus does occupy some space (measurable as \[2.Pi.r\].  
  
About numerals also. Sanskrit was a spoken language. The Sanskrit scriptures have come down from generations to generations only because of the Shruti tradition. Even BhagwadGeeta which is supposed to be more than 2000 years old, uses 'prathamo/dwitiyo/panchdasho...adhyaaya etc 'kramavaachaka'adjectives to designate the position of the adhyaayas. But no numbers! The conversion seems from the arabic to Devanagari and perhaps not the other way around.  
  
I'll have no hesitation in accepting if some scholar helps me see where I have gone wrong in my thinking.
