I think the question should be reversed. What we call Arabic Numerals 0, 1, 2, 3 ....9 are evolved in India and transmitted to Arabia through Persia and hence are called Arabic Numerals. When they were evolved into Devanagari ०. १. २. ३, ४, ५ ... ९. and then again introduced as English/international numbers side by side with Devanagari? 

And a side question. While they are called Arabic numerals 1-9, why at the same time if my memory is right, the credit was ascribed to Indian Contribution. (I had read both in the same piece of information.) If they were aware that 0 was Indian contribution, why did they fail to recognize the others Indian origin?

  

  

Good Question.



I think the last face was introduced by the Constitution to overcome the use of multiple numbering signs regionally used like the Tri-lingual formula as mentioned in the first post.
