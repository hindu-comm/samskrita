Dear Sir,

  

I think you are on the right track follow the question I had raised.

  

From the beginning of the debate of अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः - incepted in the other thread, it seemed to me that there was confusion between the expression of words and its representative figures. That is why Arvindji had raised the applicability of the maxim properly to which sequence. I sensed this confusion and had raised the question of Arabic Numerals which is a different concept than the numeral system in general in the history of mathematics.

  

In this thread it was taken up and pushed further round and round the same centric point of Hindu-Arabic-European-Indian origin of the numeral system.

  

Again it landed in the same question. Yet the proper solution to Aravindji's question raised about the approximate meaning precisely and exclusively applicable for the numeral system in Sanskrit is not proved beyond doubt about the maxim : mentioned above in the other thread. 



Thanks shreyas ji, for the thought provoking line of thinking. Somebody may enlighten me about its appropriate justification. I too was fed up the same idea. I remember, as you have said, the numerical representation of 0 in Arabic is a dot only (as I almost forgot the writing alphabet).

  

With regards
