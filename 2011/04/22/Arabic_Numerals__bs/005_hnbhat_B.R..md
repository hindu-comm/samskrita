Yes. Now one can find by googling anything from anywhere. In Vikipedia, you can find the history of mathematics and contribution of India and the related articles from where many of our esteemed members quote without mentioning the source.

  

I was referring to the question raised from my memory and the time when it was introduced as Arabic Numerals. I remember the zero was specifically mentioned as Indian contribution. And the present question related to the writing 1, 2, 3 ... 9 and 0. contrasted with १,२, ३ .... ० associated with Sanskrit via Devanagari writing. Any idea? Did Bakshali manuscripts write 1, 2, 3 ... or १, २, ३?
