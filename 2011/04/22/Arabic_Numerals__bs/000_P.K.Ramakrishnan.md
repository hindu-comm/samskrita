I have changed the subject to Arabic Numerals.

The Arabs got the numerals from Hindus. They themselves  
call them HINDASA (from India). The Europeans got them from  
the Arabs. So they called them Arabic Numerals.

The makers of the Indian Constitution understood this problem.  
So they have stated that India would adopt the international form  
of Indian numerals. Not the Devanagari type.

The word zero in English has come the arabic word zypher. The  
Sanskrit word for this is शून्य meaning nothing.
