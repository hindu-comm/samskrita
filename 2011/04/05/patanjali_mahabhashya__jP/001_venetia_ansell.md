Namaste Dhaval-mahodaya,

Thank you for this valuable service.

I am keen to view the document but when I open the page withthe list of downloadsI am unable to view the Devanagari links - they appear as a set of meaningless characters. Can you suggest how I can re-format my laptop so that the Devanagari displays properly?

Thank you

Venetia
