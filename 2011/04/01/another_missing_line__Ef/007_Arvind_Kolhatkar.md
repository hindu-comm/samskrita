Dear Dr Bhat,

You have pointed out that the verse under discussion is from  
चाणक्यनीतिदर्पणाः.

What do we know about him and his collection?

Many of the verses appearing therein are frequently met elsewhere,  
sometimes with variations, without the author being known. Are they  
indeed by ChaaNakya - whoever he is - or he too has picked them up  
somewhere and put them in his darpaNa? Examples are:

एकोऽपि गुणवान्पुत्रो निर्गुणैश्च शतैर्वरः।  
एकश्चन्द्रस्तमो हन्ति न च ताराः सहस्रशः॥४.६॥  
वरमेको गुणी पुत्रो न तु मूर्खशतान्यपि।  
एकश्चन्द्रस्तमो हन्ति न तु तारागणोऽपि च॥

आतुरे व्यसने प्राप्ते दुर्भिक्ष्ये शत्रुसंकटे।  
राजद्वारे श्मशाने च यस्तिष्ठति स बान्धवः॥१.१२॥  
उत्सवे व्यसने चैव दुर्भिक्ष्ये राष्ट्रविप्लवे।  
राजद्वारे श्मशाने च यस्तिष्ठति स बान्धवः॥

विद्वान्प्रशस्यते लोके विद्वान्सर्वत्र गौरवम्।  
विद्यया लभते सर्वं विद्या सर्वत्र पूज्यते॥८.२०॥  
विद्वत्त्वं च नृपत्वं च नैव तुल्यं कदाचन।  
स्वदेशे पूज्यते राजा विद्वान्सर्वत्र पूज्यते॥  
स्वगृहे पूज्यते मूर्खः स्वग्रामे पूज्यते प्रभु:  
स्वदेशे पूज्यते राजा विद्वान्सर्वत्र पूज्यते॥

These two verses say the exact opposite of each other and yet appear  
in the darpaNa:

लालनाद्बहवो दोषास्ताडनाद्बहवो गुणाः।  
तस्मात्पुत्रं च शिष्यं च ताडयेन्नतु लालयेत्॥२.१२॥  
लालयेत्पञ्चवर्षाणि दशवर्षाणि ताडयेत्।  
प्राप्ते तु षोडशे वर्षे पुत्रं मित्रवदाचरेत्॥३.१८॥

Some of the common sayings too can be picked from verses in the  
darpaNa:

भार्या रूपवती शत्रुः ६.११, कुतो विद्यार्थिनः सुखम् १०.३.

The following verse is common to darpaNa and nItishataka. Bhartrihari  
belongs to a much later period than aarya CaaNakya and the possibility  
that Bhartrihari himself picked up from aarya CaaNakya seems very  
remote because it has never been so suggested.

येषां न विद्या न तपो न दानं ज्ञानं न शीलं न गुणो न धर्मः।  
ते मर्त्यलोके भुवि भारभूता मनुष्यरूपेण मृगाश्चरन्ति॥१०.७॥

The verses themselves are in a very easy language and easy meter of  
AnuShTubh. This makes me wonder whether they are a collection of  
verses, embodying good morality as well as robust, even cynical,  
commonsense, gathered by a now unknown teacher, for the benefit of  
beginner-students and packaged under the name of ChaaNakya to ensure  
durability and a wide footprint. This, of course, happens all the  
time, the latest example being 'Vedic Mathematics', which, as  
discussed in a recent posting, appears to be neither Vedic nor  
Mathematics but is so named for the reason that it 'sells'.

The first part, beginning at Chapter 1 has no introduction. The  
second part, beginning at Chapter 10, has this introductory sentence:

अथ वृद्धचाणक्यस्योत्तरार्धम्

Would you like to comment on these points?

(An irrelevant aside: I remember that कुतो विद्यार्थिनः सुखम् was the  
title of a lesson in our Marathi primer in the 7th class in school.  
The lesson was about the hardships undergone by Madam Curie, while  
studying in Paris as an indigent expatriate Polish student.)
