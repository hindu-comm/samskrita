Thank you for your observation. I too just noted them ascribed to CanakyanitidarpaNa. It is always possible in the span of 2 millennium

of years that such things happen. It is true in the case of Sri Sankara, the founder of Advaita philosophy, who is accredited with so many works, devotional stora-s, beautiful ones, technical ones like Saundaryalahari and Prapancasara. Even many of the Bhashya-s attributed traditionally to him, are disputed of his authorship. Even two Buddha's and two Ashoka-s were proposed to defend his authorship by rewriting the pages of History. Believers may not agree. I came to such a stotra, विष्णुपादादिकेशस्तोत्र ascribed to Sri Sankara traditionally, wherein the ten incarnations are enumerated in order, and Buddha is considered as one of the incarnations of Vishnu, which is highly improbable, as Sri Sankara himself founded his Advaita philosophy against the onslaughts of logicians of Buddhists. For defending his authorship, to propose two different Buddha-s will be too far for a learned debate and could be left to the believers.

  

Presently coming to the Canakya Niti Tradition, a study was made compiling all the available texts under the name of Canakya by Ludwik Sternbac, which has got many such collections prevalent under the name of चाणक्य, whereas चाणक्य is believed to be a historical personage, who composed the अर्थशास्त्र and contemporary of Candragupta. The latter additions are too many, styling as वृद्धचाणक्य, चाणक्य, नीति-सार, संग्रह, etc. collecting may be many from भर्तृहरि's verses themselves, adapted to their needs. L Sternbac Ludwik, Canakya Niti Text Tradition, 1967, Hoshiarpur. in 6 volumes can be referred to for a detailed study of the tradition. For many other texts, there is a pre-posed text, हारीत-स्मृतिः, वृद्धहारीत-स्मृतिः, वृद्धमनुः, वृद्धवसिष्ठः, etc.

  

Even for the Mahabharata, there are three versions, original Jaya by Vyasa, then Bhaarata, enlarged by Vaisampayana, and then popular edition by SutapauraNika, to quote C V Vaidya, in his criticism of Mahabharata. These are apart from later additions of Parva-s and upa-parva-s in the regional versions. His book is available for download and link is given in one of the earlier posts on KuTa-sloka-s on Mahabharata.

  

Sorry for the lengthy reply.
