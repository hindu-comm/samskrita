Thanks for the explanation. I was waiting P K Ramakrishnan himself to explain it. Anyhow, literally,

  

By (reading the Mahabharata) the episode ofdice play द्यूत around whichMahabharata war is centered) in the morning, engaged in (reading) the episode of woman (सीता, the main center of the Ramayana war) in the noon, and in the episode of stealthy one (act of stealing the hearts of Gopi's and the curd and butter, by Krishna, the popular Cora), the time passes for the wise men.

  

This explains the doubt raised by Abhyankar and Mr. Murthy too. The common reading is चोरप्रसगेन which would convey the same meaning. This is the explanation for both. I have given the other version too. All the three are काव्य-s in their own right, and secondarily considered as आदिकाव्य, इतिहास and पुराण in their status as the religious texts considered traditionally. With this view in mind, "काव्यालापविनोदेन कालो गच्छति धीमताम्।" seems to be the natural completion of the previous three lines making it to mean that the three works of poetry are to be read by the wise man to pass his time. काव्यशास्त्रविनोदेन is another beginning of a different version, pedantic in its tone, to contrast with idiots. Instead, one can read anything into any verse according to his imaginative power. Very plain statement.
