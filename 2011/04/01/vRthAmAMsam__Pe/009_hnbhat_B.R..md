I don't think any one of us consult Manu for eating meat, or any food for that matter. It is only out of curiosity the opinion of the religious codes on the eating of meat is discussed here. I only pointed out the context of the verse quoted by Mr. Ramakrishnan. It is purely voluntary to use meat as food or not.
