Thanks Aravindji for the practical answer to the query of Mr. P K Ramakrishna. This is the same I too guessed, and the same fact accounts for the many references in literature derogative in nature to the crow, which often disturbs people by its harsh voice, than any other birds. By the way, the word is used in respect of Siva, and some demon too.

Traditionally, the episode of Ramayana is accounted for the singled eyed nature of the crows in general, after the episode of Jayanta, who in the guise of a crow, tried to disturb Sita while Srirama was sleeping , during her exile in forest regions with Sita. Thus angry about the incidence repeatedly, Srirama threw a darbha grass at the crow with divyastra invoked in it and cost one of the eyes of him in spite of his seeking others Siva and others surrendered Rama himself. The crow, to withdraw the divyastra, to save the life of Jayanta. Hence it became one eyed for ever.

  

> हिनस्तु दक्षिणाक्षि त्वच्छर इत्यथ सो ऽब्रवीत् ।  
> ततस्तस्याक्षि काकस्य हिनस्ति स्म स दक्षिणम् ।  
> दत्त्वा स दक्षिणं नेत्रं प्राणेभ्यः परिरक्षितः ।। 5.38.37।।

  

It was Jayanta, according to the Ramayana episode, recalled by Sita, later in Sundarakanda. This occurs in Adhyatmaramayana and Paadmapuraana too. The episode is related to its appellation as one-eye एकाक्ष in शब्दकल्पद्रुम.

  

This word can conveniently be used literally to anye one-eyed blind man too.

  

The meanings listed in Dictionary:

  

-   a crow (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   name of a being attending on Skanda (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   name of a Dānava (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   name of Śiva (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

Even if other birds, have one eye, according to any analysis, like the other words Pankaja (that grown in mud or water), kushala (one who cuts kusha grass,) do not mean anything like shells, or anyone who cuts any grass or kusha-grass, but they indicated restricting their usage to mean lotus, and skilled one (as adjective) by transference of meaning, here too the explanation holds good that it is used only in respect of crow, to the exception of others. The general accepted norm in such cases, is "योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी" meaning the literary usage is more powerful than the literal (verbal/etymological) meaning. Hence, even though the word गो is derived from the word गम् (to go), it is never used for any one who is walking, but only used to denote cow. and many other words homonyms are possible making it possible to be used to mean more than 12 meanings. And the word Pankaja is never used to denote, any fish, frog, or any aquatic creature or plant, but only to mean lotus.

  

Sorry for this lengthy message.
