Dear Group,

I have found a partial answer to my query on पञ्च पञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः in  
the following verse from Ramayana (dialogue between Vaalii and Raama):

पञ्च पञ्चनखा भक्ष्या ब्रह्मक्षेत्रेण राघव।  
शल्यकः श्वाविधो गोधा शशः कूर्मश्च पञ्चमः॥

The five animals, each with five nails, are porcupine, another type of  
porcupine, alligator/crocodile (India has the Gharial variety), rabbit/  
hare and tortoise. (Meanings from MW).

I am still interested in tracing the learned debate pro/con eating  
them.
