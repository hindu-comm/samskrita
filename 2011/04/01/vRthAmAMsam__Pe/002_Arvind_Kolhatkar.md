Dear Group,  
  
I too have a similar query.  
  
In our prescribed reading Sanskrit text was a piece called 'पञ्च  
पञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः'. It was there to illustrate how debates were  
carried out among the learned. I have forgotten everything about it  
except the name.  
  
Can a scholar here help me retrace it?
