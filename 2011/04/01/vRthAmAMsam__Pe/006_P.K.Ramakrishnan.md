Many thanks for the clarification.  I now find that there are animals having teeth only one side -

probably upper or lower. Some animal scientists should explain this.

  

It is amazing that our ancients knew more about such things. For example the crow is called ekakshi.

There is a nyaya called kaakaakshi nyaya. In a sentence a particular word may be combined with either

its previous word or the subsequent word. That a crow had to give up one eye (or can see only with one

of the eyes at a time) is told in Valmiki Ramayana.
