I thank Sri Arvind_Kolhatkar for recommending various websites regarding bird  
and animal vision. It would take quite some time to read and understand the  
implications on the bird and animal vision. Now I have only a preliminary  
question -  
if all birds could see only with one eye at a time, why only the crow is named  
ekaksha.
