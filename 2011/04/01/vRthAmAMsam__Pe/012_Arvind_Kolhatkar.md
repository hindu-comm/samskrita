Probably because the crow is the bird most seen around human populations. Also, because of its black colour andraucous crowing, it attracts more adverse attention than other pleasant-sounding and better looking birds. Several shlokas pouring scorn upon the poor crow come to mind here. EkaakSha is another way of jeering at the poor crow...

  

This is my guesswork...
