Dear Ramakrishna MahodayA

I think the “todanta” here should be interpreted as “fangs” or incisor teeth. Hence I think it means incisors on one jaw. I am not sure about what range of animals this encompasses.

Anyway Manu is very confusing, the rules permit some strange animals being eaten. It also permits eating meat in adversity and for sacrifice – and here again is the injunction (as in Gita also) killing is not killing (when it is for sacrifice).

So it is best to follow your own personal ethnics, regardless of Manu.

Vimala
