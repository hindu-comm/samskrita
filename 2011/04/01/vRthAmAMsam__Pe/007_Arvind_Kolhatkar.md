Dear Group,  
  
I am not a veterinary scientist so please do not quote me on this but  
I know the following from general knowledge and give some pointers in  
case anyone would like to know more...  
  
A Sanskrit word for 'crow' is 'ekaakSha'. As a matter of fact, many  
birds are ekaakSha. This appellation arises from the fact that birds  
seem to rotate their heads from side to side to see things. That is  
because their eyes being located on two sides of the head, they have  
less of a stereoscopic vision than, say the humans, who have their  
eyes next to each other. Two human eyes receive two slightly  
different views of the same object and the brain compares them to  
create the perception of depth of vision,that is, distance from the  
observer. This difference is more for nearer objects and less for  
farther objects. We can tell the difference between distances from us  
of two close objects very easily but not when the objects are far  
away, like trees on a distant mountain. This property or parallax has  
uses in many places such as navigation, astronomy etc.  
  
Since birds have a much poorer parallax than humans, because the  
birds' eyes are on two sides and the overlap between their two views  
is much less, they compensate for it by looking at the object with  
each eye separately by bobbing their heads, so that they capture two  
images that their brains compare. This creates the impression that  
they are only ekaakSha. (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception>  
and <http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101222073519AAt3qJ3>).  
That is why the crow got this name.  
  
Cows being ruminants have a different arrangement of teeth to aid  
rumination. Please see <http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question3962.html>  
  
If anyone wants to carry out this small experiment, look at a human  
face in a picture. When you shift your position, while continuing to  
look at the face, you will feel that the face is following you like a  
living being. This is so because the face being two-dimensional, i.e.  
lacking depth, it appears to you to look the same even when the angle  
of viewing changes.
