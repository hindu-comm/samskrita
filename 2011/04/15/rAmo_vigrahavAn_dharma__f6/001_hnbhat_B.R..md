The first from Valmiki Ramayana Aranyakanda 37 Sarga:

> रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः साधुः सत्य पराक्रमः \|  
> राजा सर्वस्य लोकस्य देवानाम् इव वासवः \|\| ३-३७-१३\|\|  
>   
> 13. raamaH vigrahavaan dharmaH= Rama, embodiment, of > righteousness;saadhuH= equable person;satya paraakramaH= > truthfulness, is his valour;devaanaam vaasavaH iva= for gods, Indra, > as with;sarvasya lokasya raajaa= for entire, world, he is king.  
> "Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, he is an equable person with > truthfulness as his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the > king of entire world. \[3-37-13\]  
> Rama's principles alone make him victorious, as he does not deviate > from the path of righteousness. And by not deviating from the path of > righteousness, he is truly valorous and the question of his defeat > does not arise, because he will abide by his conscience.

  

You can try sanskrit commentary if available (data completed) in this link also:

  

<http://valmiki.iitk.ac.in/index.php?id=introduction>



for the same verse. exactly the same number.

  

> धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः ॥  
>   

  

> धर्म एव हतो हन्ति धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः।  
> तस्माद्धर्मो न हन्तव्यो मा नोधर्मोहतोऽवधीत्। मनुस्मृतिः ८.१५॥

  

Dharma is a principle, which protects the humanity, if followed properly. If violated, it would turn out to be your nemesis.'

  

Literally Dharma, (when regularly) conserved will protect mankind, and on the contrary, it will (ruin you)when it is ruined.

Hence we should not ruin (violate) Dharma (and so that) Dharma itself ruining may not ruin us.
