Dear Kolhatkar Mahodaya,  
  
Please send me the papers on this emal id: [jaide...@gmail.com]()  
  
**Some side information:**  
Prof. Ballal from Metallurgical Engg. Department in IIT Bombay has worked in the iron making process of the Agaria tribes of jharkhand and uttar pradesh. His opinion is that the iron pillar was made in several parts welded together (as can be seen from the cross section), and differetn parts could have come from different regions of the country. The quality of the pillar's iron is quite similar to the quality of iron of the Agarias.  
  
praNAm,  
Jaideep
