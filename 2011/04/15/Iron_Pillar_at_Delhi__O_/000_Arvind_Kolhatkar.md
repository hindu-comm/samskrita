Dear Group,



Two scientific papers about the Iron Pillar at Delhi have been sitting on my hard drive for quite some time and I am not able to relocate the website where I found them. I imagine they would interest some members of the Group. Their sizes are 2645K and 371K. If anyone is interested in having them please drop me a line and I shall send off-Group after a week.

  

Their head notes read as under:

  

\<The astronomical significance of the Delhi iron pillar has been highlighted by addressing its probable original election site at Udayagiri and the probable image that was atop the pillar’s capital. Based on the astronomical significance of Udayagiri’s location on the Tropic of Cancer, and earlier solar observations at Udayagiri, it has been shown that the iron pillar may have been aligned with the cardinal directions such that, on summer solstice day, the early-morning shadow of the pillar fell along a specially cut passageway in the direction of one of the important bas reliefs (in cave temple 15) at Udavagiri site. Evidences have been provided to corroborate the identification of a circular disc-shaped object (20” diameter and 2” thick) that was probably atop the Delhi iron pillar capital.>



\< A detailed technical analysis of the characters of the oldest Delhi Iron Pillar inscription has been conducted. It reveals that the characters were put on the surface by die-striking operation using dies of different characteristic shapes. The dies were struck more than once to provide each imprint on the surface. Both the die and material surfaces were in cold condition during the operation. Evidences have been provided to conclude that the inscription was die-struck on the pillar when it was in the vertical erect condition.>
