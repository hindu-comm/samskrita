Dear Shree Kolhatkar;  
  
Thank you again for your generous offer.Could you please send the said articles on Iron Pillar at Delhi to the following e-mail address:
[raj...@hotmail.com](). Thank you kiindly for the same.  
  
I remember reading one or two technicalarticles on the pillar. (I am sure there are whole lot of articles about it). These articles discribedspecial kind of processused to manufacture this variety of iron-alloy. The details elude me, but I do recall that similar process involving "carbon" -- coal, I suppose, was and still is being used to make Samurai swords in Japan. If I locate the articles I'll send them to you and/or the group.  
  
Thank you kindly once again.  
  
Regards,  
  
Dr. Iyengar
