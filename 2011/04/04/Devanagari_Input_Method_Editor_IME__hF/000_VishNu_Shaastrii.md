One of our members asked me about creating an IME or modifying an existing keyboard. Microsoft has just such a tool that you can download for free. Here is the link:

If you have specialized needs when typing देवनागरी, then this is the utility to use. For example one of my colleagues in California wished to have a Sankrit keyboard that enabled him to type many Rig-Vedic signs and he and I created an IME called Vidyut for this purpose. Here is the link to that project and its documentation:

Hint: to save you lots of time in looking up the Unicode addresses for Sanskrit letters and conjunct consonants use the following link:

This site is a 'gold mine' of information. E.g. it has the data on \>4000 glyphs in देवनागरी! Happy browsing.
