प्रिय Venu,

I do not know of such a tool for Linux but another member of our group can perhaps help.

I have no problem reading the Devanagari script in my g-mail or indeed composing sentences in Sanskrit using g-mail. G-mail is Unicode compliant. Do any other members of our group have a suggestion for Venu?
