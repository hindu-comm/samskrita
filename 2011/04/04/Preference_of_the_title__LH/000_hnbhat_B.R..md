**

The title of the verse:

  

Verse**No.52a

*modāt pādādikeśastutim iti racitāṃ kīrtayitvā tridhāmnaḥ*

clearly states the title of the stotra as**

*pādādikeśastuti.*

It is the commentator who adds**

*pādādikeśa*

is meant for*pādādikeśānta:*

*  
*

pādādikeśāntasamagravigrahavarṃanaparatvāt

pādādikeśāntasaṃjñitaṃ stotram;

antaśabdaḥ prasiddhyā nopāttaḥ.

  

which states anta- is supplemented to clarify the meaning. For clarity we may accept he commentator's title with +anta+ added. The commentator in the introductory verses also specifies*śrīmaccaṅkarapūjyapādaracitaṃ pādādikeśāvadhistotram.*

*  
*

But the colophon of it simply gives as:\\

*  
*

*śrīmatpādādikeśavyākhyā bhaktimandākinī nāma saṃpūrṃā*

*  
*

which confirms the title of the *stotra* without *anta*as given in the text of the *stotra*.

  

Hence*pādādikeśa*only retained in the title from the text. The tridhaamnaH = VisnoH, and *stuti = stotra* are contextual added from the commentary.
