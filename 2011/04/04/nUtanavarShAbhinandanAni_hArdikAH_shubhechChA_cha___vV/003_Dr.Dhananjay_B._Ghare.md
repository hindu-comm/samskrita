Dear Shri.Abhyankarajee,  
 namaskaara.  
 Thanks for the Greetings and Best Wishes for the Vedic New Year shake 1933.  
 I reciprocate your Greetings and wish you and all sanskRuta List Members  
** A Very very very Happy and Prospprous New Tear shaalivaahana shake 1933.**  
  
 Further, I was too busy in Design and Organisation of a (11 Days) Summer School for High School level Students & Teachers in Bangalore containing  
 **sanskRuta and saanskRutik-Moral - Yoga Contents along with a Nice Focus on**  
** "Scientific and Technological Milestones achieved in 20th Century AD"**  
 and  
 **"Areas of Possible Nobel Worthy Researches in the 21st Century AD".**  
  
 Therefore, I could not attend to mails for some time.  
 **I shall be in USA from Late May 2011 to Early Nov. 2011 and**  
** if any Group will like to conduct such a Summer School in any parts of USA and Canada,**  
** I shall be most happy to provide some help (using the Experience gained in Bangalore).**  
  
** Next Year (April_May 2012), we plan to Organise this Program simultaneously at several Places all over India**  
** (and Help from Groups and Individuals from different Parts of India is most needed & is welcome)**  
  
 With regards and Best Wishes,
