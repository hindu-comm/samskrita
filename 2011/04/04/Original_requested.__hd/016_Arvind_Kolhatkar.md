Jaideep,

  

Thanks for the suggestion but buttons on my gmail screen for creating new mail are different. They look like in the .jpg file that I have attached.

  

However, my problem is solved. I have a link called 'Attach a file' as in Hotmail etc and I can use it. 

  

Earlier, I was wondering why I cannot attach a picture from inside the Group discussion. That, indeed, is not possible. One has to come out of that, open one's gmail account and use reply links appearing below individual postingsto open a new message screen. 'Attach a file' is available there.

  

Incidentally, why are the buttons different? For example I do not have the button for the Devanagari text like yours.

  

Thanks again for help...
