Dear Madam,

  

It is in the same line not vartamAnaH alone. or AvartamAnaH,

  

आ कृष्णेन रजसा वर्तमानः - It can well be interpreted without the meaning revolving, asआ (समन्ताद्)कृष्णेन रजसा वर्तमानः = being surrounded by the the black dust all around (rising from the rotation of the wheel of his golden chariot as he rides on). I think you missed this combination together along with the beautiful poetical image it gives with the description of a chariot riding his chariot on the hilly road.

  

and for भुवना नि पश्यन् = looking downwards at the world (earth) or worlds below (as he climbs up). In this case it can be earth or the worlds below the path of the chariot of the Sun riding above in the sky. For form, it is vedic form, without changing the sense according to the rule सुपां सुलुक् ... etc.७.१.३९ सुपां सुलुक्पूर्वसवर्णाऽऽच्छेयाडाड्यायाजालःsupām suluk pūrvasavarṇa-ā(t) cche (she)-yāḍ-āḍ-yāyājālaḥ

which governspūrvasavarṇa for all the case endings. It is only natural that flying above the earth looks down towards the earth, and so by casting his glance, he enlivens the living ones which were dead in his absence.(this my free translation for martyaM ca amartyaM niveshayan than the god and human being restoring to life. modified from Griffith's translation "laying to rest the immortal and the mortal" (which expects kRisHnena rajasaa related with this laying to rest as instrument to niveshayan).

  

  

Hope this might be justified if the mythological interpretation of Sayana and modern interpretation of Grifith hold good.
