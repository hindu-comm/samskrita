I found this in the English translation of Satyartha Prakash of Swamy Dayananda Saraswathi. 

I also wanted to find the original. I am again reproducing the extract.

  
1>Q. Some say that it is the sun that moves, not the earth, while others say just the reverse. Now who are right?

A.\~ They are both half grown; because it is written in the Veda, "This earth with all it waters revolves round the sun." YAJUR VEDA 3, 6. This shows that the earth revolves. Again says the Veda, "The Glorious , resplendent sun, that gives life and energy to al the world, - animate and inanimate - through rain and solar rays, and makes all physical objects visible, attracts all other planet and rotates in its own orbit, but does not move round other planets." YAJUR VEDA 33:43f
