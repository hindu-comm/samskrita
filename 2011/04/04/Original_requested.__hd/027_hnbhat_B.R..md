Thanks for your response.

  

Even then it would be geocentric view the sun revolving around the earth in the Sky every day setting back to life. To get to revolve, one would naturally expect परि prefixed than आ:

  

कालक्रमेण जगतः परिवर्तमाना ।  
चक्रारपङ्क्तिरिव गच्छति भाग्यपङ्क्तिः ।

  

अवृत्तिः, आवर्तनम्, etc. give the meaning repeated action.
