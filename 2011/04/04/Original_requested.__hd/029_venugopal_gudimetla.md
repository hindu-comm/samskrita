Dear Sri Murthy Mahadaya,  
  
Initially I was excited reading the translation, but I had my own doubts too, the reason being that even Aryabhatta himself didn't propose a exclusive heliocentric theory, if only heliocentric theory was what Yajur veda meant, then I would be surprised that he missed it which is highly unlikely for such a great astronomer.  
  
Regards,  
  
Venu
