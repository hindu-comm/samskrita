Thank you for the commentary beautifully versified version of the Sayana's commentary below.Can you please identify the commentary in the image you have enclosed?

  

The Nirukta tradition interprets the word rajas - in this verse as world. Hence the phrase आ कृष्णेन रजसा वर्तमानः  means "appearing through the dark sky every day" and the others liable to multiple interpretations, martya and amartya into two or interpretations, (man and god, the sole and body. The others being equal as earlier interpreted. Here and in earlier posts, the prefix with वर्तमान gives the word appear again and again (every day) (in the dark sky) like other cognate words derived from the prefixed word आ+वर्त् , आवृत्तिः, आवृत्तः, आवर्तयन्, आवर्तयति, आवर्तनम्.

  

A good poet has made the best use of the poetic expression suggested in the phrase अमर्त्यं मर्त्यं च निवेशयन् = setting back the mortal and immortal (to life or activity) which suggest that during night the whole world was like dead or lying in bed waiting for death (martya = martum yogyaH) like a snake bitten man by a vishavaidya is brought back to life. The description is below in the words of expert poet:

  

मीलच्चक्षुर्विजिह्मश्रुति जडरसनं विघ्नितघ्राणवृत्ति

स्वव्यापाराक्षमत्वक् परिमुषितमनःशेषमात्रावशेषम्।

विस्रस्ताङ्गं पतित्वा स्वपदपहरतादश्रियं वोऽर्कजन्मा

कालव्यालावलीढं जगदगद इवोत्थापयन् प्राक्प्रतापः।।

  

  

The other part amartyaM niveshayan completes the description offered by the poet.
