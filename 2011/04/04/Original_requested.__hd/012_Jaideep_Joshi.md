Dear Shri. Kolhatkar Mahodaya,  
  
You need to enable "Inserting Images" from Settings -> Labs. Then you will see the following "insert image" thumbnail in the text editor toolbar just above the writing space:  
![Capture.PNG](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/7909dcccd9936fdc/Capture.PNG?part=0.1 "Capture.PNG")  
  
Clicking on it, you will be able to add images within the body of the mail. Otherwise, you can always send as attachments.  
  
Hope that helps,  
  
praNAm,  
Jaideep
