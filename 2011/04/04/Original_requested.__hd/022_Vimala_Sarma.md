Thank you, bhavAn

Yes – that was very useful and I noticed something here:

The word vartamAno – is “turning” so it can be interpreted as revolving.

Also bhuvanAni is plural neuter - “worlds”

So the sun is revolving and seeing “worlds”

The English translation does not give this sense.



आ कृष्णेन रजसा वर्तमानो निवेशयन्नमृतं मर्त्यं च ।  
हिरण्ययेन सविता रथेना देवो याति भुवनानि पश्यन् ॥२॥४१२.



In general I think it is not a useful exercise to try and find modern concepts in literature written more than 3000 years ago. This is a error in hermeneutics. The concepts at that time related to the thinking and culture of the peoples at that time. The number of different concepts expressed and the richness of the literature is an indication of the complexity of that civilisation. This literature can be appreciated for its own sake.
