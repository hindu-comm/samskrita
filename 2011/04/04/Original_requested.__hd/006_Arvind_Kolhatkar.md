Dear Group,  
  
I have found that the English translation given by PKR is of a portion  
from Satyaarthaprakaasha of Swami Dayanand. It gives the original  
texts from the Yajurveda 3.6 and 33.43 and Swamijiâ€™s Hindi rendering  
of it in Ch. 8 (aShTamollaasa) on p. 189. PKR has come across an  
English translation of this Hindi rendering. (I would still like to  
know the source where he got the English translation.)  
  
I do not much understand the Vedic Sanskrit. However, I do feel  
Swamiji's Hindi rendering is not literal but somewhat free. Can an  
expert give us a literal and word-by-word translation of the extracts  
3.6 and 33.43 from Yajurveda, so that we can judge for ourselves what  
the Yajurveda has to say about the earth going around the sun.  
  
I found the Satyaarthaprakasha in pdf, which is in Hindi, at the site  
<http://agniveer.com>  
  
I have captured the relevant portion of p.189 as a .jpg file by using  
the snipping tool available with Windows 7. I would have liked to  
attach it to this message but could see no way of doing so, though I  
know it can be done, as I have seen others doing it. Can someone  
teach me how to do this?  
  
The snipping tool that comes with Windows 7 is a far more user-  
friendly tool than the old PrintScreen command, though, being buried  
buried deep inside, not many seem to be aware of it. I discovered it  
by chance.
