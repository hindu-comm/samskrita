This is English translation of Yajurveda - some portions.  
Can someone provide the original in Sanskrit.

"This earth with all it waters revolves round the sun." YAJUR VEDA 3, 6. This  
shows that the earth revolves.

Again says the Veda, "The Glorious , resplendent sun, that gives life and energy  
to al the world, - animate and inanimate - through rain and solar rays, and  
makes all physical objects visible, attracts all other planet and rotates in its  
own orbit, but does not move round other planets." YAJUR VEDA 33:43

Thanks in advance.
