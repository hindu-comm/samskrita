Dear the learned,

As per an article in Kannada by Dr. S Balachandra Rao whose contributions to understanding Indian Astronomical works are significant, heliocentric theory was suggested only by Parameswara, a Kerala mathematician and Astronomerwho lived from 1360 to 1455AD. He preceded Copernicus (1473-1543). I do not think Heliocentric theory could be squeezed out of the Vedas.

Regards

Murthy
