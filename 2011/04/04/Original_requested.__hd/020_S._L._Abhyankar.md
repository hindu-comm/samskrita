नमो नमः !  
I have compiled the discussion in a google document.  
It started  

1.  with a post by Shri. with the subject "Original requested." 2.  Then proceeded with a subject line "Heliocentric theory in
    Yajurveda" 3.  Recently Mr. P. K. Ramkrishnan initiated another discussion with the
    subject line "Vedic reference of earth going round the sun"

Since all the three discussions have a common vein, I thought it good to compile them in one document.  
It is shared for public view via the link -

**I have also added a couple of queries at (B-2a) and (B-2b). I shall be obliged for experts' views.**
