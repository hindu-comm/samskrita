Dear PKR,  
  
Could we have the source where you got the English translation? What  
we knew so far was that Aryabhatta was the first to suggest - in a  
cryptic way not free from alternative interpretations - a heliocentric  
view of the planetary system. The Yajurveda was not in the picture so  
far.  
  
How is it that everyone missed this for the last 200 years?
