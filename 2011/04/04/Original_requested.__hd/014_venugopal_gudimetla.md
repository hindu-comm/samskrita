For some reason, I doubt if the translation was done right, I will be very happy if the translation is indeed right and that we did have heliocentric concept of solar system ages back, but I doubt it, because Aryabhatta himself had both geocentric and heliocentric theories, with stress on geocentric theory, it can't be that Aryabhatta missed Yajur veda? it can't be.
