Dear Group,

Can someone among the learned members of this Group help me with the  
verse whose last line is नैकेनापि समं गता वसुमती मुञ्ज त्वया यास्यति.  
I remember only this last line.

At 3.65 in the सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार is the following verse about the  
'King of the Persians'. I am curious about this exotic-sounding  
verse. Although it falls in the chapter called विशिष्टराजप्रशंसा I am  
not sure the verse is about प्रशंसा. In what circumstance would it  
have been written? Did a Sanskrit verse-writer go to the Persian  
King's court and had occasion to compose it? The digitalized image of  
the verse has some missing letters. I wonder if someone can comment  
on these points and supply/guess at the missing words and explain the  
verse.

यदपि कटकयात्रारोधि पाथोधिना ते  
दिशि दिशि मम ?? पारसीकक्षितीश।  
तदपि कुरु मुधा नो जीवितान्तं नितान्तम्  
कथयति बहुभार्य? नैकनारीवियोगः॥
