This is in continuation of my previous verse. Here is a blog narrating the verse and the episode in Sanskrit.

Probably this should be traced to Bhojaprabandha of Ballalasena, which clubs up almost all the prominent poets in the assembly of Bhoja. I have not checked. The episode is referred to in the Hindi introduction of the book, edited by Jagadeesh Lal, published by Motilal Banarsidas, Patna, with Sanskrit Commentary, and translation in Hindi and English by the editor himself p.6. I have not located the verse as a verse Index is not available for the book. Some historical information too is provided in the introduction. Here is the link to the book online downloadable from [archive.org](http://archive.org).
