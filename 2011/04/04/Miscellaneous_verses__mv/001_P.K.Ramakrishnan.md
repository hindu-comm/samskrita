Here is the full sloka -

  
मान्धाता स महीपति: कृतयुगालंकारभूतो गत:  
सेतुर्येन महोदधौ विरचित: क्वासौ दशास्यान्तक: /  
अन्ये चापि युधिष्टिरप्रभृतयो याता दिवं भूपते  
नैकानापि समं गता वसुमती नूनं त्वया यास्यति //

The first reference is for Krita Yuga.  
The second is for Treta Yuga.  
The third is for Dwaapara yuga.  
The last is for Kali Yuga.

This is attributed to Bhoja. His father  
passed away when he was a minor.  
His father's brother usurped the throne  
and wanted to eliminate Bhoja. He  
was taken away by the executioners  
and before they did their job Bhoja  
sent this message to the usurper asking  
them to wait for his reply. After hearing  
the message, the usurper felt sorry and  
brought back Bhoja.
