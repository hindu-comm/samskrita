Respected scholars,

  

My sincere obeisances to all. I recently happened to find an English-Sanskrit Computer Dictionary. It was amazing to find such a work, as it gives the Sanskrit terms for various English Computer-related technical counterparts used in our everyday life.

  

I would like to know if such colossal works are available in other branches of science as well.It would be really encouraging to have a knowledge of proper Sanskrit vocabulary for a myriad of concepts in the field of Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. It's a well known fact that the scientific terms used in the vernacular medium schools' curricula are mostly coined from Sanskrit. So are such bilingual dictionaries available? It will be of great help to me to know more in this regard.

  

I'm attaching herewith the English-Sanskrit Computer Dictionary.

  

Thanks and Regards,

  

Aniruddha Joshi
