Congratulations that you have found the answer. It holds good in conjunctions with the coonsonants y, v, r, l, and श्, ष्, स् with the indeclineable सम् as संयम्य, संरक्ष्य, संलापः, संवरणम्. संशयः, संस्तुतः etc. The same सम् before other consonants with the other consonants, can take both the forms, like संकथा, सङ्कथा, संगीतम्, सङ्गीतम् etc. संप्रति, सम्प्रति. This is because, the prefixes, are considered as words in the grammatical sense, पद as they have lost the inflections. So treated as the external sandhi and other purposes of grammatical purposes, the rule (8.2.58) governing परसवर्ण functions optionally as per the next optional rule (8,2.59). Here is the link to the related page in Ashtadhyayi rule with commentary:

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/8-4-59.html>

  

  

So with these consonants, the consonant "m" takes the anusvaara M or assimilation with the following consonant परसवर्ण with the consonants it comes into combination. Theपरसवर्णin respect of y, v, and l are the nasalized forms of these semi-vowels (in modern linguistic description) make the alternative form for संयम्य etc. This much has been explained in simple terms in the page of earlier group comprising of the same members in this newly formed one.

  

In all other cases of internal sandhi-s, the anusvaara (either from n, or m) will be assimilated with the following vowel, replacing the anusvara with the related nasal consonants respectively with the exception of श्, ष्, स्, ह. For this purpose, the internal sandhi between the members of a compound word, is treated as external as it is formed of two or more पद-s. Hence, धनंजयः, धनञ्जयः, समितिंजयः, परन्तपः, परंतपः, both are possible as the member with this ID HAS noted in the topic referred to in your message.
