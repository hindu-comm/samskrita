Dear Group,  
  
I downloaded and quickly browsed through the dictionary. It is  
certainly a laudable effort. It can be used not only in the computer  
context but even in other writing in Sanskrit, where one may not think  
of an appropriate Sanskrit word for an English one.  
  
This leads me into two side queries. The creators of the Dictionary  
have consistently used the word 'सङ्गणक' for 'computer' or 'सङ्केत'  
for 'address' संगणक'. How are the nasals to be expressed in writing,  
i.e., are 'सङ्गणक' and 'सङ्केत' correct or should they be 'संगणक'  
and 'संकेत'? I believe there is a rule for it. Perhaps a वैय्याकरण  
can throw light on this issue, which always confuses me.  
  
Secondly I remember to have read that that 'ङ्', 'ञ्' etc are called  
परसवर्ण. Is my memory right? I did not find this word in Monier  
Williams.
