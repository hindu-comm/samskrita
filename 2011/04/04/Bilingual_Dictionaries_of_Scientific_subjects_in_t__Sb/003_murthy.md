Many many thanks.Quite evidently much effort has gone into coiningSanskrit equivalents in detailin as important a field as Computers. Authors deserve praise for their labour of love. I do not know if similar efforts are going on to work out apt equvalents in other fields of science and technology also.

Regards

Murthy
