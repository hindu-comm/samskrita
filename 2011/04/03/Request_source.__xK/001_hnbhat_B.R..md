It is ascribed to one व्यासस्मृति in a blogspot -

[](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150171445670164)But the source could not be checked for reference. The other ascribe it to मनुस्मृति, but could not be found in Manusmriti.

  

Interestingly, the last line in some page, reads:

  

श्रोता for दाता;

  

even if there is or not any audience, you will find some orator (speaker) among ten thousands. One reads:

  

दाता लक्षेषु जायते।

  

**But no precise reference is available. Subhashitaratnabhandakara is containing the subhashita, but no source is given.**
