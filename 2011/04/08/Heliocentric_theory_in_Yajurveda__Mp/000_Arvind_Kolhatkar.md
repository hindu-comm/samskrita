Dear Group,

  

At last I figured out a way to send attached files to the Group.
Instead of sending a posting from inside the Group, I am sending a message through email to the Group. Hope it works.

  

Enclosed is a snip I took of Swami Dayananda's SatyaarthaPrakaasha Ch 8 (p.189 of the digital book that I downloaded.) It has two quotes from Yajurveda numbered 3.6 and 33.43 and Swamiji's Hindi translation of it.
The translation apparently is not very literal and the Swamiji also says that 'both sides are partly wrong'. I cannot understand this as I do not understand the original. Can someone provide a word for word translation?
