Thanks Aravindji for providing the original source. It is from Shukla Yajurveda samhita. The second verse is taken from Rgveda incorporated into Shuklayajurveda text like many others:

  

Here below is the literal translation in Hindi closely following the Sanskrit text, Rgveda Mandala 1. Sukta 35 dedicated to the praise of Surya or SavitR.

  

४१२.आ कृष्णेन रजसा वर्तमानो निवेशयन्नमृतं मर्त्यं च ।  
हिरण्ययेन सविता रथेना देवो याति भुवनानि पश्यन् ॥२॥  
सवितादेव गहन तमिस्त्रा युक्त अंतरिक्ष पथ मे भ्रमण करते हुए, देवो और मनुष्यो को यज्ञादि श्रेष्ठ कर्मो मे नियोजित करते है। वे समस्त लोकों को देखते(प्रकाशित करते) हुए स्वर्णिम (किरणो से युक्त) रथ से आते है॥२॥

  

This is the Rgvedic seer's vision of the Sun travelling through the sky. Here is the link to the complete translation in Hindi to the complete Sukta:

This is the link to the complete English translation of the Sukta, by Griffith:

As usual, the words अमृतम्,and मर्त्यं are liable to different interpretations as our swamyji has endeavored.

  

The first part is the imagination of the darkness following the day, brightened by the sun. Hence he is said to be followed by the black dark mass of dust, metaphorically the dust rising out of the rotating wheels of his chariot is conceived as the mass of darkness, we see every day following the chariot of the Sun through the sky. Golden chariot is the golden rays of the rising Sun. He looks towards the worlds below him. भुवना निपश्यन् and by his sight, he awakens and get the Gods and men engaged (निवेशयन्) in their daily work on the rise of the Sun. (Men offering worship to the gods and the Gods receiving the worship in the morning Sun Rise) . This is the literal and literary beauty of the view of the Vedic poet. This mantra is used to worship Surya among the nine graha-s.

  

The first too is to be found in Rgveda 10.185

  

आयं गौः पृश्निरक्रमीदसदन्मातरं पुरः ।  
पितरं च प्रयन्स्वः ॥१॥  
अन्तश्चरति रोचनास्य प्राणादपानती ।  
व्यख्यन्महिषो दिवम् ॥२॥  
त्रिंशद्धाम वि राजति वाक्पतंगाय धीयते ।  
प्रति वस्तोरह द्युभिः ॥३॥  
  

This one doesn't seem to be so simple as the above. But it would be possible to locate literal translations by modern scholars on this available in the link given by Mr.Sunder. By the way, this verse occurs as the Verses 1 and 2 of Hymn 31 in Atharvasamhita too of Shaunaka. Here is the literal translation of Griffith:

  

Rgveda Book 10. HYMN CLXXXIX. Sūrya.  
  
1. THIS spotted Bull (आयं गौः पृश्निः) hath come, and sat before the Mother in the east,  
Advancing to his Father heaven.  
2 Expiring when he draws his breath, she moves along the lucid spheres:  
The Bull shines out through all the sky.  
3 Song is bestowed upon the Bird: it rules supreme through thirty realms  
Throughout the days at break of morn.

  

Though I could not follow the word to word translation, though it seems to be closely following the text. conceiving the rising Sun as a spotted bull running from its mother (the eastern direction) towards its father, the sky. It is day break scene on the earth too during young bull running around the herd, during the milking time. Comparison applied to the rising sun.

  

Right now I do not have access to Sayana bhashya. I will come with Sayana's interpretation little later (may be on Monday).

  

This is just for comparison of the two interpretations.
