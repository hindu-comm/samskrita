Ralph Griffith’s translation of White Yahurveda



3.6 This spotted Bull hath come and sat before the Mother and  
before  
The Father, mounting up to heaven.



33.43 Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest  
the immortal and the mortal,  
Borne on his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God,  
beholding living creatures.



Vimala
