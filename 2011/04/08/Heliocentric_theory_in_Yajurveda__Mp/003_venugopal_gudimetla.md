Also please note, that if this translation is correct, it also talks about multiple galaxies (Bhrahmaandh) sorry can't type in Sanskrit. please also note that the description is also close to the theory of existence of a black hole at the center of galaxies. It is not stated in the verse, but the verse is so similar, I am very excited.
