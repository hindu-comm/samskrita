Respected scholars,  
  
It is believed by some that 'स्योना' could be broken up as स्यः + ना with the meanings of the individual components as follows:  
  
स्यः = He = masculine nominative singular of "t**y**ad" with the same meaning as "tad"(=the usual demonstrative pronoun) but with an addition of a "ya" to its stem.  
  
ना= nominative singular of नृ (=a man)  
  
so, 'स्योना' = स्यः + ना = He (is) a man.  
  
Kindly let me know your comments on this.  
  
Regards,  
  
Aniruddha Joshi
