Arvind,



\<==

To sum up, Dixit seems to suggest that “स्योन” means the Moon, which

is quite plausible as one of the meanings of “स्योन” according to MW

is ‘mf(ā)n. soft, gentle, pleasant, agreeable’.

**hetvākṣepa!**



Yes, but while thecompleteentry, including the substantivesdoes mention 'ray of light', there is no 'moon' in the entry.

While another, albeitanonymous lexicographer, does assert'the sun' as a usage.





**sonya**

• *mf*(*ā*)*n.* soft, gentle, pleasant, agreeable (esp. to walk upon or sit upon), mild, tender, *ṚV. TS. Br. GṛŚrS.*  
• *m.* a sack, *L.*  
• a ray of light, *L.*  
• *the sun*, *L.*  
• (*am*), *n.* a soft couch, comfortable seat, pleasant site or situation, *ṚV. AV. Lāṭy.*  
• delight, happiness (= *sukha*), *Naigh. iii, 6.* \[1273,3\]



There is always that empty space between between the mind of the speaker and the mind(s) of the hearer. Lexicographers, grammarians, indeed all wordsmiths compete to fill the unfillable void. Until technology devises telepathy as a solution, thegap will remain.
