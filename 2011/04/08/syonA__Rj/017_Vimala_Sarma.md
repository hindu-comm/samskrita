I forgot to mention – that some verbs roots reduplicate the first syllable of the root for the present tense, 3^(rd) class roots, and reduplication also occurs in making the stem in some other tenses – like the perfect, the desiderative, the intensive, and so on. There are rules about how this reduplication occurs. These are grammatical rules and not phonetic rules.
