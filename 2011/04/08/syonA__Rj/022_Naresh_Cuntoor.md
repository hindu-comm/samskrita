May I suggest that you do a little more research? The interesting question perhaps is when Sanskrit become less widely spoken, and why. Not whether it was a spoken language. Conservatively, we know that it was spoken widely until at least Pantanjali's time. The examples in Mahabhashya clearly indicate that.  
  
Ancient rituals on palm leaves? Oh, please.  
Oral tradition came much before that.
