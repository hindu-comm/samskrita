Vimala,

 Thank you for the explanation, which I understand are some more rules - internal sandhi.



But I'm not clear as towhether 'reduplication' comes under that heading, or whether it's yet another set of rules?



"Sanskrit is first and foremost a spoken language â€“ so changes are made because of phonetics."



That statement is of course, open to interpretation. As a prescriptive, that belief is what someSanskritistswouldimpose upon the world, somewhat idealistically.

As adescriptive,it is again, somewhat idealistic. Neither 'is' nor 'foremost' applies in reality - the evidence before my eyes, not to mention my ears, is that it is, and was,very very much more written aboutthan spoken - being historically designed to preserve ancientrituals on palm leaves.



As a designer language, is has since yet to be bettered (Esperanto(from 'hope')excluded), but surely even a little tallyingof the numbers of written vspoken occurrences, argue otherwise?





Joanna
