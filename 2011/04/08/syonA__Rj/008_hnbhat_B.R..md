I could not understand your sentence. Only I mentioned that the word syona\* cannot be derived with Paninian rules, but with UNADI-rules, which is are accepted by Panini with a general sanction for such words without further analysis, but only according the usage the words are found in the language, with guessing their verbal part and the suffix possible, to get the required form by the rule3-3-1 उणादयो बहुलम्

which has been explained accordingly:

>   
> बाहुलकं प्रकृतेस् तनुदृष्टेः प्रायसमुच्चयनादपि तेषाम्। > कार्यसशेषविधेश्च तदुक्तं नैगमरूढिभवं हि सुसाधु। 1। नाम च धातुजमाह > निरुक्ते व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम्।

> यन् न पदार्थविशेषसमुत्थं प्रत्ययतः प्रकृतेश्च तदूह्यम्। 2।

> संज्ञासु धातुरूपाणि प्रत्ययाश्च ततः परे।

> कार्याद् विद्यादनुबन्धम् एतच् छास्त्रम् उणादिषु। 3।

  

The Unaadi rules are ascribed to Shakatayana

who held that every words could be traced their origin to one or other roots strictly. This emphasizes only the derivation from some root analogically nearest to the form of the word, applying forcibly the rules, even though much could not be gained by of explaining its meaning, than literal interpretations. Thus, the proper past participle according to Panini, would be स्यूत and could not be स्योन. But supplying the required functional elements with the above rule relaxing the scope of the suffixes, the word स्योन is derived. For meaning, you can always depend on any lexicon, traditional or modern. It is reflected as like this:

उणादयो ऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि

which I have already interpreted in my sentence relating to the word under discussion. You cannot alway look for the meaning, to the derivation of the word from some root it resembles in form. Many times, in several cases, they may help. But not always. The word is already there in usage and the etymological derivation is given according to UNADI rules making it conform to Paninian standard (without going against the Paninian standard, but relaxing certain functions or extending some).

  

Nothing more than that. I had meant by "it" referring to the word syona.
