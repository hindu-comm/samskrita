Error corrected:

The first vowel i ni is governing the change in dental s to retroflex
S. The situation is the same for the root sthA, where there is first reduplication of sthA to ti (second consonant only reduplicated) and then retroflex S in turn governs the thA to retroflex ThA to give tiSThati – 3^(rd) person sg present tense.

Many words begin with niS.

Sanskrit is first and foremost a spoken language – so changes are made because of phonetics.
