Thank you for more research into the matter.

  

The approach of historical linguists is different from that of Indian Grammarians. Likewise, any form of word founds in the corpus of Sanskrit, is to be included in any standard dictionary compiled today (whether it be in classical or Vedic corpus according to the objective in the compilation of the dictionaries). I agree. I have already said I am quoting from the traditional list of roots accessory to Paninian Grammar called धातुपाठ, and how can you find it in the modern dictionaries or linguistic manuals? Mm. Vimalaji has given the explanation for the forums you have found within the framework of Paninian Grammar.

  

No comments on which one is right. You are free to choose your favorite approach suitable for you.I gave the etymology accepted by Indian Grammarians like Panini and not otherwise. You can refer to Comparative Grammar of Indo-Euoropean Languages., for a comprehensive study of the word:

It may be out of date today, with new inventions in the field.
