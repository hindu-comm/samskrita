Hi Joanna,

I think perhaps more than the debate about whether it was a language used forcommunicating verbally- which is what we tend to mean when we say 'spoken' - in day to day life and between specific groups such as scholars and priests, the point is that the medium of expression for Sanskrit textswastraditionally verbal rather than written, much as for other ancient languages such as Greek but to a far greater extent and for a much much longer period - down to the present in fact.

Texts were heard not read, and weretaught and learnt by recitation and memorisation rather than reading and studying a written version.Texts were committed to writing, possibly as a sort of back up, but this was not the chief vehicle of transmission. Indeed the writing down of a text is in at least one place regarded to be a major transgression.

From what I understand the complex rules of sandhi developed in part because of the importance of preserving the pronounciation of the texts perfectly while simultaneously ensuring that the original forms of the words (pre-sandhi)were maintained. The absence of sandhi in other languages means that words gradually change as their pronounciation changes. For instance, where there is a double consonant thesecond consonant tends to be pronounced more and more softly. Compare the English pronounciation of 'twenty' where you can hear the 'n' and 't' with the American pronounciation in which the 't' is much less audible.

I am sure though that the scholars in this group such as Professor HN Bhat will be able to elaborate more fully on this and correct any mistakes I have made.

Best,

Venetia
