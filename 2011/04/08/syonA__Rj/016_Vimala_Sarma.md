Dear Joanna

I think you have misunderstood. I am not imposing anything! The sound of the language is very important, more so than being able to the write it. Once you can say it, you can write the sounds exactly as it is pronounced. A set of rules relate to being able to pronounce fluently, and deal with phonetics, what is called Sandhi, when changes occur because sounds are said together. I am not saying that more people are speaking it than writing it. That is what I mean when I say it is first and foremost a spoken language.
