Dr,

"For meaning, you can always depend on any lexicon, traditional or modern." iti the good doctor.

Exactly.

Butnow, as a mere human,I'mbaffled by that most dense of grammatical syntax, that baffles even the most grammarian of grammarians.

To this human,such grammar speak as "but relaxing certain functions or extending some" means "bending the rules a bit", -only in this case, quite a bit - for there does not actually seem to be any ṣiv in the first case.

"I had meant by "it" referring to the word syona". iti Dr.

In trying to unbafflethe unbaffilable(not in the dictionary), I find that "ṣiv(u) tantusaṃtāne"is indeed an IT, which is probably why I couldn't find IT, in my dictionary.

But seriously, derivations of a Sanskrit kind do not make for everymans idea of a pleasant read:



***Monier-Williams:***

uṇ-**ādi**  
• (according to some *uṇṇ-ādi*; but *see* Kielhorn, *Mahābhāṣya*, vol. i, preface, *p.* 9 *f.*), *ayas*, *m.* *pl.* the class of *Kṛt-affixes* which begin with *uṇ*. \[175,2\]

uṇ-**ādi**-**sūtra**  
• *n.* *pl.* the *Sūtras* (*Pāṇ. 3-3, 14, 75*) treating of the *Uṇādi-affixes*.  
• *-vṛtti* *f.* a commentary on the *Uṇādi-sūtras.* \[175,2\]



 What has uṇ-**ādi**got to do with sewing?





 Embroider perhaps:

. . .

to adorn or embellish rhetorically, esp. with ornate language.

- I'm sure you know what I mean . . .
