Thanks Pramod for giving suitable meaning applicable to Lord Ganesh.

  

The traditional etymologists offer different ones as I have collected below:

  

हे = शिवसमीपे, रणे वा, रम्बते इति हेरम्बः;

  

"हः शंकरे हरौ हंसे रणरोमाञ्चवाजिषु" इति नानार्थरत्नमाला;

हः = Shiva, Hari (Vishnu or Lion), Swan, fighting, erection of hairs (thrilling), horse. Any meaning applicable can be taken in the context. Choice is yours.

  

It is possible that lion and elephants are mutually enemies as found often described in Sanskrit literature and hence on seeing Ganesha his face being that of an elephant, would produce great sound on seeing Hari (the lion).

  

One more lexicon for ह -

  

हः शिवे सलिले शून्ये धारणे मङ्गलेऽपि च।

गगने नकुलीशे च रक्ते नाके च वर्ण्यते॥ इति मेदिनी

  

Some more addition to the meaning of ह.

  

हिरते = वर्धयति स्तोतॄन् इति हेरम्बः; "हिर वृद्धौ" + म्ब

हे (इति) रम्बते = शब्दायते वा हेरम्बः।  
  

Some consider this like देशी without any derivation denoting Ganesha (which is rationalistic approach, than inventing any sort of derivation to get the form) = देशीपदप्रायं मन्महे according to some remark in a commentary. क्षीरस्वामी

  

Really he is a linguist with modern view. He considers it is borrowed from regional languages. According to Mani, there were a tribal people in South India, called हेरम्ब-s inhabitants of हेरम्बक. on the authority of Mahabharata. SabhaParva Ch.31.13.(Gita Press Edn).

  

प्रत्यूषे हे रम्बते = शब्दायते वा हेरम्बः। इति नैरुक्ता:;देशीपदप्रायं मन्महे।

  

One episode is alluded to that between the child play, Ganesha squeezing all the heads of Kartikeya with his trunk, hid under the bead-stead hanging on it. Out of severe paid, he shouted, हे तात, , विनायकः, मां प्रहृत्य मञ्चे र(ल)म्बते= लम्बतेइति . Thereafter he was called हेरम्ब।

  

The above is the version of ब्रह्माण्डपुराण.

  

Free etymology: हेरम्बशब्दं करोतीति वा (हे अम्ब इति शब्दं) करोति; or हे इति रम्बते = शब्दायते - हेरम्बः।
