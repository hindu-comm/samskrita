î—“

What meaning you would like to apply to Ganesha, with the name Heramba? In many cases, the meaning derived from etymology may not be applicable to the thing it denotes as you like or pleasing to you. There would be some meaning derived from some stem or prakriti.  
  

If you would like to have some etymology offered by Indian Grammarians and tradition, I may be able to give it. It may not be the one you expect.

  

With regards
