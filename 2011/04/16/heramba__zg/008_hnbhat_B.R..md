Thanks at last for expressing your intention.

  

You know the attributes of the God from the Puranic episodes and relate them to any name assigned to him. No need to search for derivation and you can assign any meaning to any name.

  

Derivation is to arrive at the meaning through the grammatical status of the word and meaning is decided by their use. There are many words for which one cannot find origin other than historical linguistics tracing back to the origin of the words and their meanings.

  

Try your best with in that way.
