This is the lexical entry meanings for the word Heramba.

  

हेरम्बो विघ्नराजे स्यात् महिषे शौर्यगर्विते।

  

and here is the image of Heramba form of Ganapathy. You can assess the attributes of the form yourself from this or any Tantric Texts describing the form of Heramba for meditation.

Here you can find the image of Heramba.

Heramba Ganapati

Five-faced,white in color, Heramba Ganapati, "Protector of the Weak," rides a big lion. He extends the gestures of protection and blessing while holding a noose, japa beads, axe, hammer, tusk, garland, fruit and*modaka*.

Where you can yourself assess the physical attributes of Heramba Ganapathy.

  

And here is a link to your query about attributes of Heramba:

Here you can find the entry of references to Heramba Purana-s where Herama is mentioned from Puranic Subject Index. You can do a search in the sources to find a suitable explanation serving your purpose:

  

हेरम्बगणेश२.३७.१९(हेरम्बमूर्तिकास्वरूपवमाहात्म्य),२.८३.१७(सिन्धुवधहेतुउत्पन्नषड्भुजगुणेशकोहिमवान्द्वाराप्रदत्तनाम),२.८५.२३(हेरम्बगणेशसेजठरकीरक्षाकीप्रार्थना),पद्म६.२२२(हेरम्बब्राह्मणकीकाञ्चीतीर्थकेप्रभावसेमुक्ति),स्कन्द१.१.१०(गजारूढहेरम्बकीशिवकेत्रिशूलसेमृत्यु,पुन:सञ्जीवन),१.३.२.२२,३.३.१२.१७(हेरम्ब-पिताशिवसेनाभिकीरक्षाकीप्रार्थना),४.२.५७.८४(हेरम्बविनायककासंक्षिप्तमाहात्म्य),६.१४२(हेरम्बगणपतिकामाहात्म्य),७.१.३८(ब्रह्माकाकृतयुगमेंहेरम्बरूप),कथासरित्९.५.१५८,  
  

Here is the link to related page of the Puranic Index:

Check yourself.  

I had already given the episode from BrahmandapuraNa as a commentator had given, how he came to be known as Heramba in my earlier post. Pls. Check. It may be the same or a different Purana he is referring; It is not clear.

  

Try your luck.
