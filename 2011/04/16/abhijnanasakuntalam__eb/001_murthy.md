Valmiki's Ramayanam is perhaps the oldest literary piece, where a  
"signalling" element for recognition is employed in the story. "Signalling"  
is a necessary "element" in any communication system. It is often called the  
"handshake" in Information Technology. PKR has nicely highlighted how  
"signalling" plays a part in the story. This "signalling" is re-employed by  
Kalidasa in "Shakuntalam"too. Those in the know of Telecommunication  
Systems can relate to this.
