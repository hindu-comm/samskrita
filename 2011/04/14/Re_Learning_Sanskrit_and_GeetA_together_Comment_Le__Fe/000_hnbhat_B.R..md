Not at all. Guru doesn't discriminating in teaching. But it will have better effect in the most intelligent like the Mani. It is inherent capacity that makes the difference (not the discrimination in teaching by the Teacher.). This much is emphasized. As a teacher, he will do all his efforts to educate all equally. Even though DroNa taught all equally, Arjuna sprang up as the world known archer than others.

It is clearly mentioned in the verse you had commented. What he has to do as

  

शिष्यस्ते ऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्।

  

I am to be guided by you and you will please guide me surrendering myself at your disposal.

  

This is the idea emphasized in the quoted verse as I have learnt since I learnt the verse, which I remembered through out my student life. Completely surrender to Guru who will take care of you. If you do not approach him for being taught, he will never teach you anything.

  

Hence

  

शिष्यस्ते ऽहम् - त्वया अहं शिष्यः = अनुशासनीयः; धर्माधर्मविवेचने मामनुशास्तुमर्हति इत्यर्थः।

  

The word has been specially noted by Panini, who has derived from the verb शास् अनुशिष्टौ one who deserves to be taught; with the same suffix you have specified, but not the verb you have noted. With the same meaning, the next verbal form is used in the transitive sense. I am to be guided by you and please guide me surrendering myself to you. And it is not necessary to draw some other verb forcibly to mean what you intend it to be clear in meaning than is obvious from the context.

  

  

For grammatical analysis, the verb शिष् is listed among many other groups differing in meaning too widely, but in the meaning विशेषण, it is listed under 7th conjugation:

  

**शिष्लृविशेषणे।**ष्टुत्वं विशिनष्टि। अल्लोपानुस्वारौ विशिंष्ट:। विशिंषन्ति। कत्वषत्वे विशिनक्षि। लङि व्यशिनट्‌। व्यशिंष्टाम्‌। व्यशिंषत्‌। पुनरपि व्यशिनट्‌। लोटि विशिनष्टु विशिंष्टाद्वा। विशिंष्टाम्‌। विशिंषन्तु। सेर्हि: अल्लोप: हेर्धिभाव: ष्टुत्वंझलां जश् झशि(पा०सू० ८/४/५३) इति जश्त्वं डकार:झरो झरि सवर्णे(पा०सू० ८/४/६५) इति वा तस्य लोप: अल्लोपस्य स्थानिवद्भावत्वेन पदान्तेत्यादिना प्रतिषिद्धे नकारस्यानुस्वारपरसवर्णौ शिगाङित्यङि विशिंष्यात्‌। आशिषि विशिष्यात्‌। लिटि विशिशेष। विशिशिषतु:। विशिशिषु:। विशिशेषिथ। लृङि लृङित्वादङ्‌ व्यशिशिषत्‌। विशेक्ष्यतीत्यादि।

  

To distinguish, qualify as transitive, it is used with prefix वि as it is illustrated above. But without the prefix, it is not seen used in the transitive sense. like शिष्यते इति शेषः, left out, or stand alone.or even with prefix it is seen used as:

  

*तेषां ज्ञानी*नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते । (भगवद्गीता ७.१७।)



Is this more clear than the one from शासु अनुशिष्टौ - derived from Panini and used in Gita by proximity of the two forms which is very simple. I deserve to be guided by you and please guide me as to the right thing to do.
