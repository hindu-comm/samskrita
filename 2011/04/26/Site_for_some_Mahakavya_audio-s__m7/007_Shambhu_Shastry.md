Sunder ji,

  

Good site. But wah, wah, the "devil" of chronology is in the CD -:).

  

It is noted therein in English that the Megha Sandesha was "written in the 4th century by India's greatest Sanskrit poet Mahakavi Kalidasa", whereas the CD voice (of Sri Aravinda Rayah) citing numerous "BhAratIya paNditAH" informs about Kalidasa as being "kristapUrva... VikramAdityasya sabhAyAnAm". One posturing to the English world, and another to the Samskrita world! Keeps all happy....

  

Time to email a nasty note to Sri Aravinda RayaH!
