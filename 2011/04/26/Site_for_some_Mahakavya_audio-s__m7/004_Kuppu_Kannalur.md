hi Sundar,



Thanks for sharing the information.  

Kind attention : **Sri SSri SitaRama VedaSamskrutha Vidyapeethamu web site developer  
  
**i was going thro your website and in the home page picture, all the listeners sitting on the ground are wearing their Yagnopaveetham from right to left (Apasavyam).. is there a particular reason, else this could be changed to savyam. My humble suggestion.



Pranams
