Although the thread was closed and there was this note by Jambunathan  
mahodaya, I am adding some thoughts.  
  
While accepting the sanyAsAshrama by a dwija, the seeker undertakes  
the virajA hOma, among other things. Although now it is a popular  
notion that sanyAsa means abandoning everything, there is no such  
import in this hOma (or in the life of great sanyAsis such as  
VidyAraNya, MaDhva, RAmAnuja, or Shankara). Instead, the hOma is a  
process of prAyaschchitta, cleansing, and merging the individual self  
with all that there is, i.e., the Brahman (jyOtiH) and its manifest  
universe. Hence probably it is said, for a sanyAsi, svadEshO  
Bhuvanatrayam. The seeker runs away from nothing except his ego and  
self-interests: avyaktaBhAvairahankArairjyOtiraham virajA vipApmA  
BhUyAsaG swAhA. He is seeking shudDhi in everything else, in his  
physical body as well as in the prapa\~Ncha. There is no abandonment  
but total acceptance of all as his own and that he indeed is He.  
“jyOtiraham” can be taken both ways, I want to, and I am. Such a  
person, merged with all there is, is free from any karma! He also has  
no uttara-aDhikAri and kartr to do his anthyEShTi! He owns nothing; he  
is not a legal person (this was not the case with Bhagawan Shri Baba).  
This seems to be the basic logic of the sUtras (bODhAyana, 800 BC  
onwards), from which all the diverse paDhatis for the death ceremony  
for the sanyAsis have sprung up (which many members have narrated).  
Now the social reformations have benefited the shUdra too to become  
sanyAsi/sanyAsin.  
  
Members may check <http://www.shraddhananda.com/The_final_fire_sacrifice.html>  
on some of the virajA hOma mantras (there are some typo errors –  
'AGhrANa rEtO' as 'AGhrAN arEtO' etc. that members may readily spot).  
You may be able to hear it here (keeping in mind some uchChAra errors  
-:): <http://www.rhapsody.com/uma-mohan/sounds-of-harmony>.  
  
In some traditions (padDhatis), the tila hOma mantras (from  
mahAnArAyaNOpanishad) are also added, where the prapa\~Ncha (gAvaH,  
hiraNyam, Dhanam, annam, pAnam, sarasAn, sapiShtAn, ganDhAra, shriyam,  
lakShmim, puShtim, kIrtim, anr\`NyatAm, brahmaNyam, bahuputraTtAm,  
prajAm, shradDhA, mEDhA, prajnA) and the spiritual world are not  
merely sought but "sam dadAtu swAhA"; only the accumulated pApam is  
discarded and burnt.  
  
An interesting insight narrated in the voice of the jIvAtma is here:  
<http://vi1.org/mantras/virajahomam/virajahomam.mp3>.  
  
Countless are the ritual ways of becoming a sanyAsi (male) or sanyAsin  
(female), through the various padDhatis as well as, these days,  
outside of them too, with infinite kinds of dilutions, mutations, and  
distortions in practice and in documenting them, as you may spot here:  
<http://www.adolphus.nl/xcrpts/xctripa.html> (“virajA hOma mantras are  
from puruSha sUkta”).  
  
Some undertake the virajA hOma in the gr\`hasThAshrama as well, as part  
of several other prAyaschchitta hOmas, such as in the annual  
upAkarama, kUShmANda havana, pAshupata vrata, etc.
