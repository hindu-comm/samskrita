Just I mentioned about Yati-s in Hindu muths. At the time of adopting sanyasa, all the ceremonies during whole life are performed and they are said to be relieved of the relieved of the bondages with body as observed by Vidya. This goes without saying that Buddha and Mahavira are out of Vedic religion and need not be considered with Yati-s who adopted sanyasa- according to Hindu custom. This much I have heard. That may be the reason as an exceptional case, all the yati-s who are adopted sanyasa-ashrama are buried and the burials are are called holy samadhi-s worshiped in the belief they are still live.
