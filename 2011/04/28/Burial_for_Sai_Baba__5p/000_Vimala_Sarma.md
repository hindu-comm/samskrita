Everybody

Please note that I don’t want to start a thread about Sai Baba himself because I know this will be divisive and will go on without resolution. Naresh Mahoday – please do not allow this debate.



However the question I put to the group is this.

On Australian television last night it was stated that “He will be buried because it is the custom for holy men to be buried”.

I must confess I have not heard about this custom in the Hindu tradition which requires cremation as soon as possible.

Any comments on this point?
