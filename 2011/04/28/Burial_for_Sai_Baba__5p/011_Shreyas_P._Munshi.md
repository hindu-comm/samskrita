I dont know about the Saints but I can say this for sanyasins:  
  
Some thirty years ago, I had asked the same question to none other than Swami Chinmayanand-ji, and he,in his typical humorous style, said he did not know and hoped that I told him 'why'! Then he said he could only give his personal understanding and nothing more (note the humility)! He said, even among the Hindus, the funeral pyre is allowed to be lit by only the son of the deceased; if the son is not there or is unavailable, the grandson or great grand son. If none of these are available, the deceased's brother or the closest relative from the paternal side. If no relatives are available, a brahhmin priest or the King is authorized to lit the funeral pyre. He then laughingly said that sanyasins like him have no relatives...only followers or critics! They can all get together and bury him and each as an individual can safely say "I am not guilty, I didnt burn him"!  
  
So Vidya-ji is right when she says "My understanding is that saints do not need 'last rites' because they have been redeemed from worldly bondages". The difference is, as Swamiji humorously but effectively explained, not only that there no 'need' but there is no individual authourized to perform the last rites. In absence of any other explanation, I would humbly go with Swamiji's explanation. It sounds so logical!

The Buddha was cremated.  
Even Mahavira.too  
AFAIK the usual Indian practice if one passes away is Cremation, unless one attains Jiva Samadhi like Swami Raghavendra.

EverybodyPlease note that I don’t want to start a thread about Sai Baba himself because I know this will be divisive and will go on without resolution. Naresh Mahoday – please do not allow this debate.  
  
However the question I put to the group is this.On Australian television last night it was stated that “He will be buried because it is the custom for holy men to be buried”.

  
  
I must confess I have not heard about this custom in the Hindu tradition which requires cremation as soon as possible.Any comments on this point?Vimala
