As Vidya says, what I have heard is that anyone who has attained samadhi, in the sense of voluntarily leaving their bodies to join with the infinite (unlike everyone else who cannot control when they die and whose souls are then re-born in another body), is not cremated.
However, what I thought is that the body would be put into a river or some other water-body.This at least is what happened tooneof my husband's relatives who was a sadhu, and I think he was living in Varanasi so presumably the Ganga.

I would be interested to learn more if others know more about this.
Thanks
