But I have seen that the yati-s are burried, some after they leave this body and some while they are live. As in Mantalaya, Raghavendra Yati, the Yati is said to have entered the grave himself, and it was closed as in the film Saleem and Laila film. Burried alive. I do not question the belief nor the tradition. But is the very common view to have the graves, of Yati-s called Vrindavan, as they are frequently visited with devotion and prayers. We can see as many as the number of the Yati-s in the muth, so many numbers of Vrindavan-s in the Muth. This is meant by the custom as reported by the Australian TV.

  

I also would request for any authentic reference from Dharmashastra or SmRiti-s to that custom from the members. I myself do not have access or interest in looking for them in the vast body of Dharma-shastra and SmRiti-s. But it somebody knowing can come up with it, it is welcome.

  

But I can quote one verse in regard to the query from the excerpt of धर्माकुत commentary on Ramayana :

  
एते धर्मा मनुनापि सङ्गृहीता:---- 'वयस: कर्मणोऽर्थस्य श्रुतस्याभिजनस्य च। वेषवाग्बुद्धिसारूप्यमाचरन्विचरेदिह' इत्येवम्प्रकारेण। स्मृतयो वेदानुसारिण्य:। तथा च कालिदास:---- 'श्रुतेरिवार्थं स्मृतिरन्वगच्छत्' इति। स्मृत्यनन्तरं महतामाचार: प्रमाणम्, तत्सन्देहे व्यवस्थापकत्वात्। तदुक्तम्---- ***'अर्थोऽपि नैक: स्मृतयो विभिन्ना नैको मुनिर्यस्य मतं प्रमाणम्। धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायां महाजनो येन गत: स पन्था:'*** इति।

  

The same is meant by custom. The variant is the first stanza, begins with"श्रुतिर्विभिन्नास्मृतयो विभिन्नाः" So it may be difficult to trace the origin of the custom exactly to any source.

  

I too don't want any debate on this.

  

With regards
