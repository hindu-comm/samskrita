I believe that it is common practice for a saint to be buried rather than cremated, Swami Sivananda, Swami Muktananda, Trichy Swami have been buried. The usual practice is to place the body in a salt filled crypt, rather than bury it in the ground and it is done to polarize the saint's presence to a particular place, to preserve his power on the earth. Some guru lineages do not bury, but rather cremate.  
I don't know about Ramana Maharishi or Sri Ramakrishna.
