The norm for people that have been formally ordained into sanyAsa, is that they are buried and not cremated. All the pontiffs of the various religious ashrams in India are interred in burials and often have memorial *brindAvana-s**,* funerary structures erected over their samAdhis.*  
*  
a single shrAddha called the yatishrAddha is performed for monks, after which it isn't necessary to perform annual rites.  
  
There are minor differences in theactual burial details for variuos kinds of sanyAsins, depending on whether they are of the kuTIcaka, bahUdaka, hamsa, paramahamsa or parivrAjaka kind of monk.
