Dear Vimlaavarye

  

The ordinary form of sansakaara is with fire. You are right about that.

  

However, there are certain categories of people who are not put to that sansakaara.

Usually the sanyaasi and yogi of certain orders are buried.

  

I am not sure if this has something to do with their special capacity to sit in samaadhi where life signs are hard to detect - just my guess.

  

Very young born are also put to fire.

  

I hope this should be enough for now as this group is primarily for sanskrit and not about practices related to life.
