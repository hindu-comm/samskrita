I have heard from my father(who was a Sastri) about 70 years ago that a sanyasi is buried

in a sitting position and his head is broken by pounding coconuts on the head before

covering with mud. The idea is that the soul of the sanyasi goes up through the head and

joins the paramatma or the supreme soul.

  

Perhaps I am adding one more point for discussion.
