I'm starting this thread to update this GROUP about my activities @ my blog.  
As my blog is a Sanskrit-Blog, so this topic will not go against rules of this thread (although it seems as advertisement).  
  
I've published a few works of sha\~NkarAchArya, padmapAdAchArya, vidyAraNya, madhusUdana-saraswatI, etc. Most of them are not easily available now a days and some were never published ever (or in near past).  
Few are my original contributions with my small commentaries on bhAShya, etc.  
I also developed an IME (Sanskrit Keyboard Layout) called medhA which enables me to write devanAgarI anywhere. Details are on my blog.  
And, I've developed some pictures of Mother shrI lalitA-mahAtripurasundarI with help of my friends. A new photo was just posted on blog @ <http://bit.ly/gkz9Qi>
