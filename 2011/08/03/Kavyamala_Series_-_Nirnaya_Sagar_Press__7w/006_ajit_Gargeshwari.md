Dear Shakar,  
Kavay Mala series was published by Nirnaya Sagar Press (NSP) and not Chaukhamba. Chaukhamba Publishers have only published Kavmala Guchhka (in 14 volumes priced at around Rs. 1000) and a few work published by NSP. Most of Kavya Mala series and other NSP are available in on DLI site and [archive.org](http://archive.org). To compile a list download any one book and look at the list of titles published which will be on backside of the cover pages.  
  
As NSP press is out of business for more than 50 years, to collect a copy of all their publications which runs to hundreds of titles may be an extremely difficult task  
  
Regards  
Ajit
