A list of 11 titles are found in this site:

  

<http://library.du.ac.in/dspace/simple-search?query=Kavyamala&sort_by=0&order=DESC&rpp=10&etal=0&start=0>

  

as I googled. The may be available in DLI or [archive.org](http://archive.org). Just google and you should get some titles from different books with titles. Hope this will work. "Kavyamala Series"

  

In the above link there is one volume as Kavyamala Part II which is a collection 13 poems. May be a first volume be available in the same. There is no Series number.

  

No.1 should be here:

  

<http://www.archive.org/details/KavyaMala>

  

and No.14 is also available.
