I would also be extremely grateful for any more information anyone comes across on either Nirnaya Sagar Press or the Kavyamala series. I have one Kavyamala volume scan (from the DLI) which I can easily send to anyone who would like it.



On a more general note, I find it very difficult to get hold of books that are out of print (even from publishers who are still in business).

It would be wonderful if someone would re-publish some of these books many of which contain the only ever published copy of a text (in many cases the texts do of course exist in mss libraries, but mss are oftenvery difficult to access and decipher for those who are not full time scholars). If anyone ever hears of a publisher who is republishing these out of print books, especially the very rich NSP collection, please do let me know.



Thank you
