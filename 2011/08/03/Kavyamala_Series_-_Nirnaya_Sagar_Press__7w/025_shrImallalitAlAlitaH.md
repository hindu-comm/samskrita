I checked again and talked with shankara.

Now, I can say that there were two series with same name.

First series had title kAvyamAlA too. It had only 14 volumes. These are now published by chaukhamba.

Second series had different titles, as kAvyAnushAsanam, etc. And these were 90+ in numbers. These are out of print now. We have some volumes from delhi university and dli.
