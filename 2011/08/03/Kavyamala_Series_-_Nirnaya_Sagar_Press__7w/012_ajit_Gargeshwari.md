Hi Vimala  
  
DLI is digital Library of India <http://www.dli.ernet.in/>. Please use dli Downloader to down load books. I have downloaded more than 70 books from KM series using this site and [archive.org](http://archive.org). Please also got to the site **sanskritdocuments**.org/ it gives you all the sites where books can be downloaded. I have a personal digital library collection of over 2,000 Sanskrit and Indology books downloaded from these sources.  
  
A Member said " It would be wonderful if someone would re-publish some of these books many of which contain the only ever published copy of a text (in many cases the texts do of course exist in mss libraries, but mss are oftenvery difficult to access and decipher for those who are not full time scholars)."  
  
The answer is who would pay for republication?  
  
You are right on the secod part  
  
  
  
Thanks  
Ajit
