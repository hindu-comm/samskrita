Namaste,

  

I came to know from Sunderji that there were 2 separate series named Kavyamala. One was a series of single books and the other was named "Kavyamala Guchchaka" - collection of smaller works (4 to 10 in each volume). The former are around 100 in number and the anthologies (guchchakas) are less than 20 (may be 14).

  

So, I assume that what Chaukhamba has published must be the Kavyamala Guchchakas series. I will be thankful if someone can confirm this or add any more info on this.



regards  
shankara
