Namaste to all,

  

I would like to gather details of Kavyamala series of Sanskrit books published by Pandurang Jawaji, Nirnaya Sagar Press, Bombay in the first few decades of 20th century. It appears that there are at least 100 volumes of rare and previously unpublished Sanskrit books in this series. I could find some of them at the Digital Library of India. Is the complete list of books of this series available with anyone?

  

regards  
shankara
