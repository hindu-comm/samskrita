Namaste,

  

Thanks for the info about Chaukhamba edition.  

  

In fact, I was looking for a complete list of the titles in the Kavyamala series. Do you know if Chaukhamba published all the volumes separately or together?



regards  
shankara

I'm not sure about availability of digital copy of complete series. But, it was printed by chaukhamba in near past. It is available with them even now, I think.  
I've also collected some copies from Dli.
