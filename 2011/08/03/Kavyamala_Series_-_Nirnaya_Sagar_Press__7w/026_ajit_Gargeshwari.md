Dear Sharnkar  
What was originally published as Kavyamala Guchchaka by NSP is 10 Volumes ( which account for more than 325 works) have been Re Published by Chaukhamba in 14 volumes with the title Kavayamala  
  
Please note and do not be confused between Kavyamala Guchchakas which are different from Kavayamala Series both have a different numbering system.  
Many of the books published under Kavyamala series have more than one edition not just reprints  
  
NSP have also published several books outside Kavyamala series also which will not have a number  
  
I hope this is clear enough  
Thanks  
Ajit
