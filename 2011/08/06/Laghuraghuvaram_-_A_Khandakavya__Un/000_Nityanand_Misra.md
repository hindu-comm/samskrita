Namaste,  
  
I am a new member here, just joined today. I am pleased to share with you a digitized version of Laghuraghuvaram (लघुरघुवरम्), a minor poem (खण्डकाव्यम्) composed only in the short syllabes of Sanskrit (hence the name, "laghu"raghuvaram). The poem consists of 84 verses composed in the Gityarya (गीत्यार्या) metre, otherwise known as Acaladhriti (अचलधृति) - which has 16 short syllables in each quarter. As a result the entire work of 84 x 16 x 4 = 5376 syllables does not contain a single long syllable.  
  
The work was composed in the late 1990s by the Sanskrit poet [Jagadguru Rambhadracharya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagadguru_Rambhadracharya) and was published in the Hindi and English versions of the [Swarnayatra Granth](http://www.rightbooks.in/product_details.asp?pid=9788176462884&Holy%20Journey%20Of%20A%20Divine%20Saint%20%28in%202%20Vols.%29%20Being%20The%20English%20Translation%20Of%20Swarnyatra%20Abhinandan%20G) (published to commemorate 50 years of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya) which came out in 2000 and 2002 respectively. The digitized version is currently without a translation, but both Hindi and English translations are available in the respective Swarnayatra Granth.  
  
The Sanskrit only manuscript of the work is available under [this link](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/ViewContent/pdfs/Jagadguru%20Rambhadracharya%20-%20Laghuraghuvaram.pdf).  
  
Read and enjoy,
