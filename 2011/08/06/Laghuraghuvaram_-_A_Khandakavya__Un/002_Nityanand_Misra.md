Glad you liked it Srinivasan Ji.  
  
To get an idea of the complexity of the work, assuming a 50-50 probability of short and long syllables, the joint probability of 5376 consecutive short syllables while speaking Sanskrit is 2 ^ -5376, which is around 4.6 x 10 ^ -1619.  
  
Now that's just the probability of the metrical rule being followed, all four quarters of each verse rhyme as well (not needed in Sanskrit but a requirement in Prakrit metres - Achaladh.rti is a Prakrit metre).  
  
So the work is indeed very difficult.  
  
सुदुष्करोऽयं कार्यः परन्तु कवेः पराऋतम्भराप्रज्ञा तु प्रसिद्धा एव, वशीकृतशारदेभ्यः किमपि न दुष्करम्\|  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
