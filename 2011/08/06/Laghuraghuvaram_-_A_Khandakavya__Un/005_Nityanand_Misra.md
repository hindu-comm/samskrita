It's not surprising that the rhythm of the work matches that of hanuman chalisa. The hanuman chalisa is in chaupai metre which is 16 instants X 2. Achaladhriti metre is 16 instants X 4 with the additional constraint that all syllables are short. So one achaladhriti metre is a special case of two chaupai metres.
