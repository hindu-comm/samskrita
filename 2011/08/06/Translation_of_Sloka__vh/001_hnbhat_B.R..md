In another recent post, there is one link to a translation of the Stotra with a commentary. Please refer to the commentary in English. Hope you will find a solution.  

Even after you have the question, please raise it specifically.



Generally in the context of Vedanta phylosophy the guidance of a Guru is sought for achieving the goal. पद. In view of this it can be translated as तत्पदं refers to the ब्रह्म by referring to the preeding attributes by relative clausees, yat and tat. Which is grammatically at first seems to be normal. It emphasises the guidance to ahcieve the target of attaining the state of Brahma (or different terms according to different Vedanta Schools).

  
The link is in the thread shree guru stotra.
