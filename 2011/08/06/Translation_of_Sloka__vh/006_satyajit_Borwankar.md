The third one comes nearer to the meaning sought to be conveyed, I feel.



In coloquial Hindi we use the word "pada" for Station i.e if a person has reached a given stage in his career, it is referred to as "pada" similarly we could also say, that tat-pada is That Station (The seat of the Brahman)
