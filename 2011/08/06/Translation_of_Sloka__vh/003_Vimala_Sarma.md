Thank you Shan – Ji, Murthyji and Meenu Ji

I am very touched by your e-mails.

Thank you all for good wishes – I go in for surgery in a weeks’ time.



Tatpadam darshitam yena – by whom ‘that place’ is seen or is shown.

Tatpadam here has special meaning.

Comes from Katho – see valli 3, verse 8



sa tu tatpadam āpnoti yasmāt na jāyate – he reaches that place from which he is not born again.

Also referred to as paramam padam, the highest realm.



Vimala
