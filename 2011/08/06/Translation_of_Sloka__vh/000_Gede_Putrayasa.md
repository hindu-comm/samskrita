namo namaH brothers and sisters,  
  
I have question on translation of the following sloka from Guru Stotram  
  
अखण्डमण्डलाकारं व्याप्तं येन चराचरम् । तत्पदं दर्शितं येन तस्मै श्रीगुरवे नमः ॥ १॥  
  
Frommy understanding after searching the web and dictionaries, forपदम् fromतत्पदं दर्शितं येनthere are at least 3 meanings: foot, word, and state.  
My question is, which of the 3 is most suitable for the sloka? Or maybe have more proper meaning for the sloka?  
--  
Thank You  
Sincerely,  
Gus
