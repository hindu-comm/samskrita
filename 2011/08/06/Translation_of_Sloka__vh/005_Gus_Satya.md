namo namaH,  
  
Thank you brothers and sisters for the responses to my questions.  
  
akhaNDa maNDalaakaaraM vyaaptaM yena caraacaram \| tatpadaM darshitaM  
yena tasmai shriigurave namaH \|\|  
  
From googlings I found some translations for the above sloka:  
  
- Salutations are to that guru who showed me the abode, the one who is  
to be known,  
whose form is the entire universe and by whom all the movable and  
immovable are  
pervaded.  
  
- Salutations to that glorious Guru who has shown me the Reality of  
the pervasive,  
unbroken infinite mandala of moveable and immovable beings. (from  
[www.jayakula.org](http://www.jayakula.org))  
  
- My Salutations to that Guru who revealed to me that Truth, which is  
unfragmented, infinite, timeless divinity, and which pervades the  
entire universe – movable or unmovable. (Translation by Swami  
Atmananda)  
  
And the following is my attempt at translating the sloka after  
considering your responses:  
  
akhaNDa – not fragmented, maNDalaakaaraM – cosmic form, vyaaptaM –  
pervaded, yena – by which, caraacaram – moving and unmoving, tatpadaM  
– that place/that state, darshitaM – shown, yena – by whom, tasmai –  
for him, shriigurave – for glorious Guru, namaH – salutation  
  
- It is an unlimited and continuous cosmic form which pervaded the  
moving and unmoving, to that glorious Guru by whom has shown to me  
that state, I offer my salutation.  
  
  
Putrayasa
