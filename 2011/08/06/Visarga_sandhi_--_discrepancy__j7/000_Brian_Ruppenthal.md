Friends, esteemed scholars,

  

I am aware of the combination of sandhi rules whereby रमः+ अस्ति --> रमोऽस्ति .

  

Does the same transformation hold for नमः + अस्तु ? Would we then get नमोऽस्तु ?

  

I suppose these two examples may differ, since the latter began with an -as ending (in the nominative case) whereas RamaH has an -aH ending in the nominative. And I vaguely remember an ordering feature of the sandhi rules whereby one cannot go back through to an earlier transformation.

  

Is that correct? Can anyone explain it?

  

Here is why I ask: I saw this example, from the Valmiki Ramayana, sundara kAnda, sarga 13: 

  

namo astu raamaaya salakSmaNaaya \|

devyai ca tasyai janaka aatmajaayai \|

namo astu rudra indra yama anilebhyo \|

   namo astu candra arka marud gaNebhyaH \|\| 5-13-59

  

<http://www.valmikiramayan.net/sundara/sarga13/sundara_13_frame.htm>  

  

Does this show a discrepancy in applying visarga sandhi, whereby  नमः + अस्तु --> नमो अस्तु rather than नमोऽस्तु ? Or is there a rule that covers this.  

  

Thanks!  

  

Brian
