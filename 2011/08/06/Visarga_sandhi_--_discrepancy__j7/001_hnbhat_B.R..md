I think it is just split like that because of the facility of roman transliteration for the sake of clarity of understanding the two words like the ones splite inside the next large compounds





candra arka marud gaNebhyaH

janaka aatmajaayai .



in which cases it doesn't go against Sanskrit Sandhi, but in this case too it doesn't go against sanskrit sandhi - namaH + astu \> namo astu \> namo 'stu. It is the intermediatary stage in the process. The symbol ऽ is only orthographical convention to facilitate understanding as in the case of रामोयं - can be रामः + अयम् or रामः + यम्। the addition makes clear रामो ऽयम् in the first case differenciating it from the second. In practice, this has been accepted to show the elision of अ in the Sandhi, following ए, ओ and nothing more than that. The same with the compound words too. They are split with spaces to show the members in the compound distinctly without the spliting of the compond grammatically. But in namo astu - it would add one more syllable in the metrical structure, and it would affect the fluent reading.



Hope this much makes clear.
