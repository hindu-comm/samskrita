**Subject:** Where is Meru.  
  

  

There was a discussion in this group about the reference in maha-samkalapa -Bhartavarshe

Meroh dakshine parshve -bhuumadhyarekhaayaah uttaradigbhaage मेरो: दक्षिणे पार्श्वे भूमध्यरेखाया: उत्तरदिग्भागे.

  

I am quoting a verse from Aryabhatiya which states that meru is the north pole. Those residing

downwards upto the equater, meru is in the north. So Bharatahvarsh is in the south side of Meru.

From the equater upto meru is land. Bharatavarsha comes north of the equater. Gods(Amaras)

reside at Meru. From the equater down upto the south pole is all water.
Australia and Antarica

had not been discovered then. The South Pole is called Badavamukha.
Maras (Demons) reside

there. For people resding between equater and South pole, south pole would appear to be at their north.

  

For people standing at the north pole as well as those at the south pole, it would appear that they areall standing up below the sky. Each consider themselves positively and permanently below each other.

  

स्वर्मेरु स्थलमध्ये नरको बडवामुखं च जलमध्ये /

अमरमरा मन्यन्ते परस्परमधस्थितान् नियतम् //
