Namaste:  
There is a great difference between objective truth and subjective  
truth. The Puranas are meant to illustrate deep mythical,  
psychological, and spiritual truths, not map out physical geography.

Mount Meru can be viewed as many things, but my favorite explanation  
for it is entirely internal. Jambudvipa can be viewed as an analogy  
for our own bodies, Mt. Meru as our spinal column, our eyes the sun  
and the moon, the Devas living all within us.

-Santo  
aum shanti shanti shantih.  
"The world is like the impression left by the telling of a story." -  
from the Yoga Vāsiṣṭha
