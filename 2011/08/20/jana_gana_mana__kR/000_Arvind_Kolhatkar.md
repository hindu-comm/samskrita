Dear Group,  
  
This is not exactly 'Sanskrit' but since everyone here is an  
Indophile, I am sure this will be liked.  
  
A new rendering of जन गन मन has appeared on youtube and can be heard  
at:  
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JltFQS9kFXA>  
  
The old one by A.R.Rehman is here:  
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD3gDA-5S0>  
  
The new rendering displays the names of the artistes while they are  
before us. It also gives all five stanzas of जन गन मन.  
  
Between the two of them, I would say that Rehman's version is a wee  
bit better.
