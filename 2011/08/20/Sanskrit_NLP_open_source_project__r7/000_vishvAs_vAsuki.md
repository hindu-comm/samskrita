priyANi mitrANi.

  

0\. Following discussion in [another thread](http://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/browse_thread/thread/e3ac5dea945d3ec0), and some positive responses, I have created a Mercurial[repository](https://bitbucket.org/vvasuki/sanskritnlp/)on bitbucket for an open-source sanskrit NLP project.

  

1\. Contributors may use any language compatible with the Java Virtual Machine as long as they try their best to write correct code (I personally prefer Scala, as it combines the speed of Java with the conciseness of Python, though people may be more familiar with java).

  

2\. It uses [sbt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Build_Tool) as a build system. All you need to run or build your code is to invoke bin/sktnlp with the appropriate command (Please take a look at that code for details). After getting code from the repository for the first time, you will runbin/sktnlp build.

  

3\. As proposed in the earlier[thread](http://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/browse_thread/thread/e3ac5dea945d3ec0), we could first focus on developing a wiktionary bot.However, currently there is no code currently in the project.

  

4\. License we will use is undecided, but we should go for one with the least restrictions possible. Note that, if necessary to take advantage of others contributions, we can have different licenses for subcomponents.

  

5\. Others are welcome to contribute code which runs on the Java Virtual Machine. All contributions will be gratefully acknowledged. Anyone who would like check-in access, please let me know.
