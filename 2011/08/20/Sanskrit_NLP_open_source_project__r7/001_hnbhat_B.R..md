Welcome to your effort. I am not at all familiar with computer language and only with Sanskrit Language Morphology (traditional). My all the best wishes for success.

  

Here is one offering different analysis of the synonyms found in Amarakosha:

I don't know whether it would help you. There are two searchable database in CD forms for the Indian lexicons: वाचस्पत्य of Taranatha Bhattacharya and शब्दकल्पद्रुम of Radhakantha Debh, both released by Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan and Sanskrit Academy respectively. Both deal with traditional morphological analysis of the words included with sources quoted.

  

Both are available in IN Eversions too in pdf format. Both can be utilized for data collection.
