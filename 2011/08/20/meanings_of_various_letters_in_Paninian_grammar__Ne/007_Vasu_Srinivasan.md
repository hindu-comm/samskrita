bhat mahodaya  
  
  
thanks for a detailed explanation.  
  
dhananjaya-varya  
  
dhanyavaadaH, yes this helps. I was also looking for the characteristics of it-markers and their commonality.  
  
In addition to what you have described, for eg टित् means some modification in the beginning, कित् means modification in the end (aadyantau Takitau). In णिच् the presence of "Nit" indicates a vriddhi (10th gana, causative) etc.  
  
Is there a comprehensive list of the characteristics of "it" and pratyaya-s ? (like a detailed analysis of all "it" and pratyaya-s).
