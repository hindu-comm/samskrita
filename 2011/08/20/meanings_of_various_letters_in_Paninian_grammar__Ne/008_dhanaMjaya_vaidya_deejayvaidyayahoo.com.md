Because you are talking of details of the metalanguage (or algorithm  
language), this gets slowly more complex.

"आद्यन्तौ टकितौ ।" speaks of the characteristics of टित् कित् for आगमs  
not प्रत्यय. The प्रत्यय terminations beging governed by the rule  
परश्च, are always AFTER the word form to which they are described to  
be attached. How can you tell which is आगम and which is प्रत्यय ? My  
guess is that all matters from chapters 3-5 in the aShTAdhyAyI are  
प्रत्यय.

In प्रत्ययs कित् prevents गुण and वृद्धि changes to the stem.

I would also like a good reference list of the इत्-markers :-) I will  
check if one of my books has a cheat-sheet. The introductory volume to  
the mahAbhAShya translated in marAThI has a table (introduction  
written by the late mahAmahopAdhyAya K.V. Abhyankar.). But my memory  
is that the section is only meant to be explanatory, not  
comprehensive.

धनंजय
