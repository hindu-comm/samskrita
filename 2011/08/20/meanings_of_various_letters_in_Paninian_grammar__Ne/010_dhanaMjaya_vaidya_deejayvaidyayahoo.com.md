Your guess about bottom-up approach is probably correct.  
  
भर्तृहरि (many centuries after पाणिनि) explains in detail, पतञ्जलि  
(just a few centuries after पाणिनि) explains in passing, that the  
rules of grammar are deduced by अन्वय व्यतिरेक i.e., the observations  
of similarities and differences. And then the similarities are  
abstracted (अपोद्धार) into mental constructs. (It is sentences, and  
not mental constructs that have "reality" that can be used for  
meaningful conversations.)  
  
For example, a child observes two adults conversing:  
"Bring a cow" says the elder; the younger adult performs the action,  
and the child observes it.  
At another time, the elder says "Bring a horse"; the younger adult  
performs the action, and the child observes it.  
  
It is only after the child has heard and seen both, that the child  
realizes that the sound of "bring-a" was similar in both situations.  
Also there was something similar in the actions performed. So whatever  
the child observed to be similar in the two actions, that is impressed  
on the child as the meaning of "Bring-a"  
Whatever the child observes that was different in the two situations,  
that is impressed on the child as the meaning of "cow" and "horse",  
respectively.  
And so on, for the rest of the language with a lifetime of observation  
of similarities and differences.  
  
The fact is that there should have been something parallel at all in  
the two actions. If not, the child is not likely to try to divide the  
sound-stream into parts. For example, if the two situations were "pit  
bull" (a kind of dog) and "total bull" (an expression of disgust)  
there is nothing similar in the situations so, there is no motivation  
to divide the sounds and try to find a meaning for "bull".  
  
Similarly for dividing words into stems and terminations. And then for  
grouping terminations. And so forth.  
  
However, it is acknowledged by संस्कृत grammarians that unlike the  
understanding of sentences that are associated with actions, the  
division of sentences into words, and of words into stems and  
terminations is only a formal exercise of mental abstractions, with no  
guarantee of the conclusions being "real".  
  
The only reason that पाणिनि is so popular is that his system is very  
compact. I.e., similarities and differences have been observed, and  
similarities compiled into categories to the maximum extent possible.  
Every time similar elements of the world (of language) are gathered up  
into a single entity, this makes the description of the world (of  
language) more compact. Language is so vast, that without compact  
descriptions, if we tried to describe by enumeration expression-by-  
expression, even a whole lifetime would be insufficient :-)
