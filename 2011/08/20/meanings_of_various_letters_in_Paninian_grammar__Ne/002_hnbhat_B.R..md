I don't think any letters in Paninian Grammar have any lexical meaning, but many have technically assigned by Panini to them to suit the functions in the broader scheme of his Grammar. Generally all the words related to lexical items also do relate to the form of the words and they do not mean the sense conveyed by them. If he wants to convey specific meaning, he will do it with describing them and not directly use the words.

  

  

1-1-68*स्वं रूपं शब्दस्य*अशब्दसंज्ञा काशिका शास्त्रे स्वम् एव रूपं शब्दस्य ग्राह्यं बोध्यं प्रत्याय्यं भवति, न बाह्यो ऽर्थः, शब्दसंज्ञां वर्जयित्वा। शब्देन अर्थावगतेरर्थे कार्यस्य असम्भवात् तद्वाचिनाम् शब्दानाम् सम्प्रत्ययोमा भूदिति सूत्रम् इदम् आरभ्यते।

  

The words (used in the rules of AshTadhyayi) 

i.e. augmentations of letters with the suffixes are classified and listed below by Panini before he starts the description and actual use of them which are technically called इत्- generally called as अनुबन्ध = augmentations (to the suffixes, words etc.)

  

  

1\. उपदेशेऽज्-अनुनासिक इत् । । १,३.२ । ।

  

In the scheme, a nasal vowel is इत्;

  

For example, "अत इनि-ठनौ" which prescribes a suffix "इनि" by which we get the secondary derivative words ending in -in like करिन्, धनिन् - meaning having कर (the tusk - i.e.elephant), having धन (- having wealth, i.e. rich) etc. Here the last vowel "i" is termed इत्, but it doesn't find place in the actual form of the word. See the last rue in the end of this section, तस्य लोपः - it (the item listed as "इत्") is invisible (in the actual form of the word). 

  

2\. हल्-अन्त्यम् । । १,३.३ । ।

  

The finale consonant (हल् = consonants, अन्त्यम्) as you can see in the next suffixठ\[न्\], which by some other substitution ठ becomes इक, as in धनिकः (in the above sense itself - one having wealth).

  

\[Except\]

न विभक्तौ तुस्माः  । । १,३.४ । ।

(But) not the (final consonants in ) तवर्ग (t, th, d, dh, n) and "s" "m" in the case endings (are not designated as इत्).

  

Ex. रामान्, रामात् - etc.

अम् in the accusative singular: सुहृद्+अम् - सुहृदम्।

  

3\. आदिर्ञि-टु-डवः  । । १,३.५ । ।

Initial ञि, टु, डु in the listing of verbs (धातुपाठ) (are termed as इत्).

  

Ex.\[ञि\] धृषा - धृष् \> धृष्टः।

\[टु\]वेपृ - वेप् \> वेपथुः - वेपते etc.

\[डु\] डुपच\[ष्\] - पच् - पक्त्रिमम्। पचति

  

4\. षः प्रत्ययसय  । । १,३.६ । ।

  

The initial ष in a suffix (प्रत्यय) (इत्):

Ex.बहुव्रीहौ सक्थ्यक्ष्णोः स्वाङ्गात् षच्॥

  

In बहुव्रीहि - compound, the words सक्थि, and अक्षि take \[ष्\]अ\[च्\].

like: विरूपाक्षः (विरूप+अक्षि + अ \> अक्ष्\[इ\]+अ>अक्ष)

  

5\. चु-टू  । । १,३.७ । ।

  

The initial consonants belonging to the groups च-वर्ग (च, छ, ज, झ, ञ), ट-वर्ग (ट,ठ,ड,ढ,ण) (termed as इत्)

  

Ex. The feminine suffixes, टाप्, डाप्, चाप् - affixed to the words to get corresponding feminine gender forms:

  

अज - अजा (अज + \[ट्\]आ \[प्\]; etc. In all, the ट्, ड्, च् are elided in the form.

सीमन् - सीमा (सीमन्+\[ड्\]आ\[प्\];

This word is in form itself in feminine gender. But it takes this suffix. Ending in consonant "n" and ending in "आ" with this suffix. Hence, declined in both ways:

सीमा, सीमे/सीमानौ - सीमाः/सीमानः (the second alternative form is ending in consonant).

चाप् - कोसलस्य अपत्यं स्त्री - कौसल्या-

कौसल्य+\[चाप्\] \> कौसल्या;

  

Of the other consonants, ठ is substituted with इक, ढ by एय, छ \> ईय. So these suffixes do not comply with these rules.

The remaining are the suffixes, झि, झ suffixes for verbal conjugation, in both the झ् is substituted by अन्त् and we get पठ+अन्त्+इ - पठन्ति; एधन्ते etc. वस्+झ \> वसन्त \> वसन्तः;

  

6\. ल-श-क्वतद्धिते  । । १,३.८ । ।

  

The initial ल्, श्, कवर्ग (क, ख,ग, घ, ङ) (designated as इत्)

with theException:

of those suffixes designated as तद्धित

  

Ex. The participle forming suffix ल्यु -

  

नन्द्+ल्यु \> नन्द्+\[ल्\]यु \> (यु \> अन) \> नन्दनः;

वद्+ल्यु \> वदनम्। etc.

श् - शस् - सुहृद्+\[श्\]अस् \> सुहृदः (the final स् becomes visarga)

कवर्ग -

ज्ञा+क \> ज्ञः;

वद्+खच् - प्रियंवदः;

जि + ग्स्नु - जि+\[ग्\]स्नु \> जिष्णुः

लिख् + घञ् - लेखः;

The feminine suffix ङीप् \[ङ्\]ई\[प्\] -

पाञ्चाल . पाञ्चाली; etc.

  

There are suffixes, like लुक्, श्लु, and लुप्

which are zero morpheme suffixes. Instead of saying lopa, these are used to denote the loss of any suffix. All the letters are lost, either by included in one or other of the above categories in these three.

  

Exception to the above:

of those suffixes designated as तद्धित suffixes:

-

वाच् + ग्मिन् - वाग्मीन् - वाग्मी; (orator, eloquent in speech)

केर+ल \> केरलः having Kera-s coconut trees - )

वटु + क \> वटुकः - (small boy)

बहु+शस् - बहुशः mostly. or in most cases;

etc. does not disappear in their secondary derivative suffixes (तद्धित-suffixes).

The above meaning is the result of the suffixes.

  

  

तस्य लोपः । । १,३.९ । ।

Its lost (the item termed as इत् by the above rules will be invisible in the actual formation of the word).

  

The above is the general scheme. Many more would be found in the total corpus of nearly 3000 rules and it would be a content for a single book to collect and explain all the augmentations as already worked out by some scholars. "Anuandha" all types of augmentations. The above I have listed only those called इत् and their purpose in the derivation of actual forms of the words with them. The augmentation of specific letters serve different purposes of other functions too. For example;

  

चूटू - The initial letters of the two categories for obvious purpose they are elided in the actual form. But they have some other functions too which are called for by affixing the specific letters. For example, च् augmentation has relation to some operation governing the accentuation system in the Vedic scheme of words accents. Others augmentation of घ् -

in the participle forming suffix: as it is elided, it warrants the application of the rule "चजोः कुः घिण्ण्यतोः" which prescribes the final च् and ज् of the stem/root to which it is affixed, substituted by कवग. i.e. k, and g corresponding to them.

  

Thus, you get with the same suffix -

पच् + घञ् - पाच्+अ \> पाकः;

भुज्+घञ् - भोज्+भोगः

रज् - रागः etc.

  

This would give the idea of explaining each and every augmented letters, would be amount to studying the original work of Panini अष्टाध्यायी itself. Books and Dictionaries can give some partial explanations only. There are exceptions to the above general rules either by modification, extention, emendation by subsequent writers.



Sorry for the lengthy message. Ignore this, if found too much boring.

  

With regards
