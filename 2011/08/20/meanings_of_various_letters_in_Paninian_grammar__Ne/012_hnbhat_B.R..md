I think the discussion has turned into the philosophy of language via theories of language from Panini's Metalanguage. I do not make any addition, but point out to the two books written on the subject long ago:

  

1.Panini's metalanguage -Hartmut Scharfe(American Philosophical Society, 1971)

  

2\. Indian Theories of Meanig, by K Kunjunni Raja,ALS 91, 1969 (3rd Edn)

  

3\. The Word and The World - by BK Matilal, OUP, 1990.

  

I don't want fill in the message boxes with the contents wanting books to have a least glance. Regarding the view of the basis of Paninian classification, this has been discussed in the introduction - It is the shortest way of deducing general principle behind the formation of the words and exceptions to them noted at a place easy to handle the whole scheme of the words used in the language. It is called उत्सर्ग (Generalization) and अपवाद (Exceptions). In addition to these, the rules are classified into six types by their function:



सञ्ज्ञा च परिभाषा च विधिर्नियम एव च ।

अतिदेशोऽधिकारश्च षड्विधम् सूत्रंलक्षणम् ॥  

This explains the general scheme of Paninian Grammar. This is sorting is based on the functions of the सूत्र-s. Hence there is no mention of these terms in his rules, exceptआदेश-प्रत्यययोः which casually means substitution for any word, syllable etc.  Hope this explains the question of Venetia. The simple differentiation between the आदेश and आगम are explained with the maxim शत्रुवदादेशः, मित्रवदागमः - any letter prescribed as substitution, replaces the original one for which it is prescribed, like an enemy dethrones the original ruler. The आगम augmentation is just comes in like a guest and stays with it, to which is prescribed.

  

The most of the संज्ञा-s are explained in the first Chapter with परिभाषा-s in अष्टाध्यायी. सिद्धान्तकौमुदी explains them in suitable topics संज्ञा, and परिभाषा sections, gathering from different parts.

  

  

Regarding कित् - in the previous post,

  

In suffixes generally, "आद्यन्तौ टकितौ" holds good in आगम-s. It has other functions too. When a कित् suffix is added, it prohibits गुण and वृद्धि to which it is prescribed in primary suffixes. For example, कृ + \[k\]ta - कृतः here it prohibits the गुणः, which was applicable in the case of तृच्. कृ+तृ - कर्तृ - कर्ता; by virtue of the rule "सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोः" as both being आर्धधातुक - suffixes, warrant गुण. But in the case of तद्धित secondary suffixes, the same कित्, warrants वृद्धि to the initial vowel of the word to which a कित् suffix is affixed. Thus, पुरोहितस्य भावः - पुरोहित + य\[क्\] - पौरोहित्य - पौरोहित्यम्.

  

And so on, there are many interlinked functions related with the augmented letters to suffixes.

So knowing fairly the function and purpose of them will amount to the study of complete अष्टाध्यायी which is certainly beyond the scope of some messages in this thread. As Dhananjay remarked, Abhyankar's dictionary gives an outline of them only.
