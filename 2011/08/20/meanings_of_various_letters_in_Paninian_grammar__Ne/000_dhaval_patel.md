Hi all,

I want to have a fair understanding of what all the letters in the Paninian grammar stand for.

If somebody can tell what are the meanings of the letters like

  

छ, ड, घ ....

  

like what would be the difference between टाप्‌ and डाप्‌

  

what would ट, प mean here ?

  

and so on....

  

Dhaval
