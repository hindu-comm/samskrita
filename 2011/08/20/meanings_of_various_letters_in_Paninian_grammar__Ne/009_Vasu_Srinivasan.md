thanks for correcting on the आगमs vs प्रत्यय  
  
Just to add details about "characterstics of it, pratyaya"... what we study now is more like a top-down approach. we take panini sutras and analyze to see what it means and where it applies.  
  
i was looking for a bottom-up approach of how panini may have done it.  
  
(this is my guess) - For eg panini might have taken all the vibhakti-endings for all the shabda-s and come up with a few common pratyayas. Then abstract them to a fewer common pratyaya-s and finally to one pratyaya (say \~gas or \~gis). Then notes the differences to reach the actual vibhakti in "offset" sutras (eg from s to visarga). The pratyaya possibly offers the shortest distance to a destination for majority of the scenarios. Reading the characteristics of it-s & pratyaya-s will give a glimpse of that.
