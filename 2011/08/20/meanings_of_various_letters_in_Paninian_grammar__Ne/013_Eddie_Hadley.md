Dr,

The words (used in the rules of AshTadhyayi)

i.e. augmentations of letters with the suffixes are classified and listed below by Panini before he starts the description and actual use of them which are technically called इत्- generally called as अनुबन्ध = augmentations (to the suffixes, words etc.)





1\. उपदेशेऽज्-अनुनासिक इत् । । १,३.२ । ।



In the scheme, a nasal vowel is इत्;



For example, "अत इनि-ठनौ" which prescribes a suffix "इनि" by which we get the secondary derivative words ending in -in like करिन्, धनिन् - meaning having कर (the tusk - i.e.elephant), having धन (- having wealth, i.e. rich) etc. Here the last vowel "i" is termed इत्, but it doesn't find place in the actual form of the word. See the last rue in the end of this section, तस्य लोपः - it (the item listed as "इत्") is invisible (in the actual form of the word).



2\. हल्-अन्त्यम् । । १,३.३ । ।
