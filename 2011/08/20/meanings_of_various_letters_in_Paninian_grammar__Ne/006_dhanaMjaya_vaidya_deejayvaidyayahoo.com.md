Excellent introduction to इत्-markers by Bhat mahodaya.

In today's world with printing and writing being common, a modern  
पाणिनि-like grammarian would use asterisks, typographical symbols etc  
instead of इत्-markers. For example, a modern dictionary may list the  
verb कृ thus:  
कृ\*#  
and have endnotes in the dictionary  
\*All verbs marked with \* have forms -त्रिम (In this instance कृत्रिम)  
# All verbs marked # are used with आत्मनेपद terminations if the agent  
gets the benefit of the verb-action, but परस्मैपद terminations if the  
benefit of the action goes to someone else. (In this instance कुरुते,  
करोति, respectively)

The modern dictionary writer does this, because there is no chance  
that someone is going to get confused that \*, # etc, are actually  
part of the verb, because they do not represent any normal संस्कृत  
sounds.

In पाणिनि's time, the book was transmitted orally. So instead of  
typographical symbols, he chose syllables and sounds that any संस्कृत  
speaker would hear as "weird", nor normal संस्कृत sounds. These  
function the same as the asterisks and other symbols in today's  
dictionaries and computer programs.

So for the listing of the verb कृ , one orally memorizes thus:

(डु)कृ(ञ्)

And elsewhere in the book, the notes are given:  
\*(डु) All verbs marked with \*(डु) have forms -त्रिम (In this instance  
कृत्रिम)  
#(ञ्) All verbs marked #(ञ्) are used with आत्मनेपद terminations if  
the agent gets the benefit of the verb-action, but परस्मैपद  
terminations if the benefit of the action goes to someone else. (In  
this instance कुरुते, करोति, respectively)

  
The इत्-markers are pure footmpte markers are are not short forms for  
longer words. After using the footnote, no trace of the marker is left  
in the final word forms.

There is another class of short-forms that पाणिनि uses. There are  
actually longer sounds that end up in words, but for ease of  
memorization some short-forms are used in the rule book. The long  
forms are also given once within पाणिनि's book, after that short forms  
are used again and again. This is also done in modern technical books.  
For example, in my mathematics book there is a note early on that "e -  
base of natural logarithms", "i - square root of negative 1", etc.  
After that throughout the book only the symbols "e" "i" are used for  
convenience. In fact, the long forms have to come to my mind if I ever  
have to apply the formulas. But you cannot deny the convenience of the  
short forms.

Such are the पाणिनीय short forms फ् छ् झ् etc.  
फ -> आयन,  
झ् -> अन्त्  
etc.

Now the specific example from the original query:

\> like what would be the difference between टाप्‌ and डाप्‌  
\> what would ट, प mean here ?

ट् ड् प् are all इत्-markers  
प्‌ refers to the स्वर not being strong-on-its-own for this  
termination. (The original word's स्वर, before adding the termination  
determines the feminine word's स्वर. Usually, the termination gets to  
determine the स्वर of the new word formation.)  
ड् refers to the fact that if the original word ends with a consonant,  
that consonant and its prior vowel are to be deleted before addition  
of the termination,  
सीमन्+(ड्)आ(प्) = सीम् - (delete अन्) + आ = सीमा  
ट् here is to distinguish this termination from डाप् चाप् as needed.  
(In चाप् , च् specifies that the newly formed word's final स्वर is  
उदात्त.)

Hope this helps.
