Namaste to all

  

I request the scholars of this group to reply to the following query of a friend of mine. His family has been chanting some selected chapters of Devi Mahatmya for generations. In the 11th chapter, there is the following verse,

  

त्रिशूलचन्द्राहिधरे महावृषभवाहानि  
माहेश्वरीस्वरूपेण नारायणी नमोस्तुते

  

In the first line the Devi is addressed as "महावृषभवाहानि" as per the text used by his family where as all other texts (including that of Gita Press) used the word "महावृषभवाहिनि". Can the word महावृषभवाहानि, used by his family, be right? If so, please explain the meaning of वाहानि and also how the samasa is formed.  



regards  
shankara
