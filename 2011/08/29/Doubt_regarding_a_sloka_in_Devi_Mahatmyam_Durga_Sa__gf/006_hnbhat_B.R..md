Right. Thanks for notifying it. I just said the popular reading could be justified वृषभः वाहनं यस्याः सा - वृषभवाहनी - in feminine nom.sing. from बहुव्रीहि compound*and not in masculine gender. B*ut here it is used like others, in the vocative in the context following and preceding.

So it it should be वृषभ-वाहनि or वृषभ-वाहिनि vocative singular.

  

Here it is derived as वृषभाः एव वाहाः - वृषभवाहाः, now in masculine it would be as you suggested: वृषभवाही - and in feminine gender वृषभवाहिनी, vocative sing. \*वाहिनि (this is the popular reading). This can be explained otherwise also, I am not sure, वृषभेण वाहिनी, like धान्येन धनवान् - but compound formation may not be possible.
