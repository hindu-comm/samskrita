Without the correction in the previous post, it could also वृषभ-वाहनि but the long हा seems to be erroneous anyway print mistake. Either it should be short अ or इ as the case may be, the meaning doesn't differ. One having the great bull नन्दिन् as the वाहन common to महेश्वर.

  

It does not contribute any meaning to the context of attributes as it appears to me. Some body may explain it as having great bull वाहन-s or great bull carts with the help of dictionary, but it does not suit at all in this context with the preceding and following verses in praise of Devi in this context as explained by me in my previous post.

  

I am reminded of a legend seeing your wording "used by his family" a story:

  

"भार्यां रक्षतु भैरवी" line was read as "भार्यां भक्षतु भैरवी" by a Brahmin as he was taught and he married as many as times, but none of his wives survived for long. This was the result caused by following the erroneous reading the story wanted to emphasize. But

|                                           |     |     | |-------------------------------------------|-----|-----| | ***भक्ष (अदने, चुरादिगण, परस्मै, लट्)*** |     |     |

will take only भक्षय instead of भक्ष. Just some one floated this story.

  

Here there is some meaning but unsuitable to the context.
