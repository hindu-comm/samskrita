Here is the correct version:

  

**त्रिशूलचन्द्राहिधरे**महावृषभवाहिनि ।

माहेश्वरीस्वरूपेणनारायणि नमोऽस्तुते ।। १४।।

  

It simple says who has the वाहन a great bull and others attributes of महेश्वर corresponding to him that she is called माहेश्वरी - with the attributes of माहेश्वरी she is having the attributes. And it is नारायणि addressed to Devi as she is born out of the वैष्णव शक्रि:

  

### त्वं वैष्णवीशक्तिरनन्तवीर्या विश्वस्य बीजं परमासि माया । सम्मोहितं देवि समस्तमेत- त्वं वै प्रसन्ना भुवि मुक्तिहेतुः ।। ५।।

The verse is a 11th chapter of देवीमाहात्म्य and after the शुम्भवध in Ch.10 देवी is praised in this Chapter completely and hence it is called नारयणीस्तुति emphasising and enumerating different feminine forms of Devi corresponding to many male Gods, like ब्राह्मी,माहेश्वरी, वाराही, नारसिंही etc. with the same attributes. In this verse it is corresponding to शिव - महेश्वर. Many other अवतार-s are also listed at the end.

### इति श्रीमार्कण्डेयपुराणे सावर्णिके मन्वन्तरे देवीमाहात्म्ये नारायणिस्तुतिर्नाम एकादशोऽध्यायः ।।

Hope this makes clear the idea of the verse.

  

There are two popular stuti-s for daily recitation, this one and the one in 4th Chapter which also another beautiful स्तोत्र by the gods after the महिषासुरवध in the 3rd Chapter. I hope not more introduction to this text popularly called सप्तशती (700 verses) or देवीमाहात्म्यम् from मार्कण्डेयपुराण as it is said.
