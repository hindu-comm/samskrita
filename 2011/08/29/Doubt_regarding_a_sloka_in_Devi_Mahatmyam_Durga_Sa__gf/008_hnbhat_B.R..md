You are right. The regularly she rides a lion or occasionally a tiger (I am not sure) as some pictures project her. But she rides a lion when she killed Mahishasura according to देवीमाहात्म्य of which this is the 11th Chapter. The present verse is a part the whole chapter and has to be taken into account considering preceding and following prayers.

  

ब्राह्मी माहेश्वरी चैव कौमारी वैष्णवी परा।।15।।

वाराही चैव माहेंद्री चामुंडा सर्वदेवता।

  

These are the forms corresponding to the male counterparts up to माहेन्द्री. So all the attributes of the male counter-parts are described in respect of the corresponding female form of देवी. I had already explained this in my first post itself. In the present case, it is माहेश्वरी, having the same old bull common for the two (two seater car) but now she is riding it solely in her माहेश्वरी form. Here is the complete text of सप्तशती (seven hundred verses) otherwise known as देवीमाहात्म्य -

Hope you can enjoy reading it, if not read earlier.

  

    ब्राह्मी माहेश्वरी चैव कौमारी वैष्णवी तथा ॥ २-८७४ ॥

    वाराही चैव माहेन्द्री चामुण्डाः सप्तमातरः ।

The seven are called सप्तमातरः the main incarnation being चामुण्डा the fierce one among the seven.

  

I think now it should be clear, why she addressed called as वृषभवाहिनी in the verse. For more information on other forms, you can refer to the text of 11th chapter in the link provided. Each having their own riders tentatively.
