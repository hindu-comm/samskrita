I think no two authorities agree about nomenclatures of meters.  
पादाकुलक/मात्रासमक is a good example of this. A मात्रावृत्त with 16  
मात्राs is called by Apte as मात्रासमक, with the 9th place in many  
instances occupied by a लघु and the end being a गुरु.  
Vrittaratnaakara has a chapter called मात्रासमक on 16 मात्राs,  
containing vrittas with different names depending upon the placements  
of लघु गुरु at specific places. One of these is also called  
मात्रासमक, in which the 9th place is a लघु and the end a गुरु. A  
Hindi book called 'Chandprabhaakara' consulted by me calls a meter of  
16 मात्राs as पादाकुलक and includes it in a general chapter called  
मात्रासम. This chapter has several other meters with more or less  
than 16 matras.

I think there would be no commonly agreed final answer in such  
questions, where the meter is not one of the most popular, such as  
शार्दूलविक्रीडित, वसन्ततिलका, शिखरिणी etc.
