I agree with Dhananjay that the meter of this stotra is पादाकुलक,  
consisting of four पादs, each पाद consisting of 4 मात्रागणs, each  
मात्रागण of 4 मात्राs. I am also somewhat surprised that this escaped  
the attention of C.P. Brown, a renowned scholar of his times.

This also enables us to understand why he said that the meter has

  
different arrangements of भगण (-- u u) सगण (u u --), २ गुरु (-- --) ४  
लघु (u u u u), with २ गुरु (-- --) at the end of each line out of  

four. (According to Brown, he has himself discovered this defining

  
feature of the meter of charpaTapaMjarika Stotra, previously unknown  

to any published volume.)

Among the अक्षरगणs, only भगण (-- u u), सगण (u u --) and जगण (u -- u)  
have exactly 4 मात्राs. All other अक्षरगणs have more than or less  
than 4 मात्राs. It is not surprising that other अक्षरगणs cannot occur  
in पादाकुलक. Apparently, relying on Brown's statement, it also  
appears that जगण (u -- u) too does not appear anywhere in  
charpaTapaMjarika Stotra, though there is no reason to proscribe it in  
a general arrangement of a पादाकुलक.

It is observed by Shreevatsa that the meter has the name of  
पज्झटिका. According to Chhanda-Prabhakara of Jagannath Prasad  
'Bhanu', an excellent Hindi book on prosody available at DLI, पज्झटिका  
satisfies the requirements of पादाकुलक, but has an additional  
requirement that the arrangement of its 16 मात्राs should follow the  
pattern 8+गु+4+गु =16. As worked out by me above, the first line of  
the following verse of the Stotra fails in this test:

यावत् । पवनो । विलसति। देहे -- --। u u -- । u u u u । -- --।  
तावत् । पृच्छति । कुशलं । गेहे। -- --। -- u u । u u -- । -- --।  
गतवति । वायौ । देहापाये u u u u । -- --। -- --।  
भार्या । बिभ्यति । तस्मिन् । काये॥ -- --। -- u u । -- u u । -- --।
