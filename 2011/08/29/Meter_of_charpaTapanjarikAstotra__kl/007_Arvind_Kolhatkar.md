Re: Chhandoracana of Madhav Trimbak Patwardhan (1894-1939):  
  
Madhav Trimbak Patwardhan was a professor of Farsi in the Fergusson  
College, Poona and Rajaram College, Kolhapur. Writing under the pen-  
name of Madhav Julian, he was also a prominent member of the circle  
of romantic poets in Marathi and a member of like-minded young poets  
called 'Ravikiran Mandal' in the 1930s. His personal beliefs  
regarding intermingling of young men and women in colleges cost him  
his position of a professor in the conservative Fergusson College,  
forcing him to move to Kolhapur. For a brief bio. please see  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhav_Julian>  
  
From being a Farsi expert, he later became an ardent advocate of  
'purifying' Marathi of alien - especially Persian and Arabic -  
influences.  
  
He wrote a monumental book called Chhandoracana in the latter part of  
his life. It brought him a D.Litt. of the Bombay University a few  
days before his death.  
  
I have been searching for this book online, if available, for a long  
time but without success so far.
