It is a mātra-based metre. As the other post observed, all of these are exactly 4 mātras (with laghu = 1 mātra and guru = 2 mātras). Each line consists of 4 groups of 4 matras (or 16 matras in total). Subject to this constraint, the rest is more or less free variation. (All the verses I've checked share this property, and no nice property based on looking atगणs.)

  

I have heard that this metre is called **Pajjhaṭikā (पज्झटिका)**.

  

If this is not right, someone please correct me.
