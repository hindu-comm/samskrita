Dear Kolhatkarji,  
I believe that it is not a gaNabased( yamaataaraajabhaanasa ) vRutta. Each  
quarter consists of four numbers of 4-matra groups. It is in detailing of  
such matra-based gaNas that Fibonacci numbers were discovered by our  
prosodists. For example  
4-matra gaNas are 22,112,211,121, 1111, a total of 5 which is a Fibonacci  
number. (1=laghu,2=guru).  
Any one of these 5 combinations can be used.  
Such type of matra gaNas are extensively used in Kannada versification  
although they are a rarity in Sanskrit.  
Regards  
Murthy
