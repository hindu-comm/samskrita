The Vedic Sukta has the deity ब्रह्मणस्पति, whereas in its modified version later, we use to change the deity in worshiping in पञ्चायतन with the same ऋषि is changed to गणपति conveniently to suit the purpose. गृत्समदो गणपतिर्जगती - whereas according to वैदिकानुक्रमणी-s the deity is ब्रह्मणस्पति explicitly invoked by the vocative. When this shift took place is a matter of opinion if historicity is acceptable. If not, voluntary volatile freedom of the worshipers accounted for.
