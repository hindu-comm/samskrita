Replying only from an etymological perspective:

devatA –deva+tA fem sg, secondary nominal, meaning any divinity

preta – departed ones

bhUta – gross elements (philosophical); but could just be something which exists, a being

gaNa – means hosts or crowd (such as the Shiva’s gaNas of dwarfs and goblins)

But there are a hierarchy of celestial beings such as devas, apsaras, gandhArvas, yakshas, nagas, and demons of various types –rakshasas, pishAchas.

There are also different types of semi-divine beings – rishis, such as nArada.



I will leave it to the scholars in this forum to add traditional knowledge.

Vimala
