Anyhow, I do not contribute to this view. The hymn appears as follows in the early part of the Rigveda 2nd Mandala:

  

*गणानां त्वा गणपतिं*हवामहे कविं कविनामुपमश्रवस्तमम्। ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत (ब्रह्मणस्पते voc.) आ नः शृ्ण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम् ।। (ऋग्वेद २।२३।१).

  

But here the mention of गणपति is not addressed to the गणपति of the पुराण-s as it is obviously addressed to ब्रह्मणस्पति a popular Vedic diety In the 23rd Sukta, of the total hymns, the same ब्रह्मणस्पति is addressed explicitly, 5, 9, 11, 17 and 19 who is again called as बृहस्पति also in the other hymns in this सूक्त itself. Hence it is clear that it is different from the गणपति of the पुराण-s project as the son of शिव and the leader of गण-s.



The literal meaning of the above hymn is very clear: O Brahmanaspati, we invoke you, the leader of the group among the गण-s, (the group of देव-s according to the commentator, but it applies to the next groups of which he is distinguished) - the most popular कवि among (the group of) कवि-s, best lord of prayers (for the group of) prayers. In short, it is this deity is addressed as the prominent one among any group, and as example two are cited. And it can be a general statement praising this Vedic deity.

  

Now coming to the identification of this with the invoking the गणपति in the पञ्चायतन system, as the one related to the पौराणिक गणपति, described as एकदन्त, वक्रतुण्ड, विघ्नविनायक, लम्बोदर, गजानन etc. epithets project, the transformation is based on the very word here in this hymn गणपति. I am also the one, among them using this मन्त्र to invoke गणपति in the पञ्चायतन system. The same transformation had already taken in the गणपत्यथर्वशीर्ष which again specifically mentions एकदन्त, etc.

Shri Ganapati Atharvashirsha occurs in the atharva veda . It is considered to be most important text on Lord Ganesha .

  

Several translations of the text are available.  
  
1- Ganapatyatharvasirsopanisad by Sukthankar. 2- Ganapati : Song of the Self by Grimes 3- Saiva upanisads translated by Srinivas Ayyangar 4- Aum Ganesha : The peace of God by Navaratnam 5- Ganesha : Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings by Courtright 6- Glory of Ganesha by Swami Chinmayananda 7- Ganesha Kosha by Rao.

  

I remember there was a study of Ganapati cult too by some European Scholar.Dr.S.M. Michael did fieldstudieson the origin, development and political implications onGanapathi cultin India. Here in this link there are more references to independent studies on different aspects of Vinayaka cult. One gives the idea of a female Vinayaka(I) too. Here is the link:

Here is the extract from गणपत्यथर्वशीर्ष -

  

  

which clearly modifies his form and ideology parallel to other Upanishad-s. Historically it may be a later production and an attempt to combine Vedic and पुराण ontological descriptions into one.
