These are my notes based on Kanchi Sri.Chandrasekara saraswathis discourses Deivathin kural . Based on this what we have as Vedas is only a small drop of the ocean. and based on the argument telling ganesha is not described in the vedas wont be fair.

  

--------------------

  

vyasa classified vedas into 1180 shakas and classified them as four vedas

  

out of that 1000 shakas were in samaveda,21 in rigveda,109 in yajur,21 in atharva

  

but now only 6-7 shakas are available for us

rigveda only 1 is available (shakala shaka)

out of 15 shukla yajur only 2 are available (kanva shaka,mathyanthina shaka)

krishna yajur out of 94 only thaithriya is there

out of 1000 sama only 3 are remaining (thavalavakar (or) jaimaniya shaka,gautuma shakaraanayaneeya shaka)

atharva nobody is there who knows even one shaka they searched and found only one person in gujarat who knew it

they send some ppl from mutt to learn it

  

out of bramhanas only aithreya and kaushethakee are available from rigveda

shatapatha bramhana is only available in shukla yajur

thaithriya bramhana is the only one available in krishna yajur

  

thantya bramhanam,aarsheya bramhanam,thevathaatyaay bramhanam,samhithopanishad brammanam,vamsa bramamam(shatvimsa,samavithana bramhana,santhokya bramhanam,jaimineeya bramhanam) are also available

only kobatha bramhanam is available in atharva veda
