Why did such doubt arise ? There seems no genuine cause. Denying anything without any genuine conflict to suite your own views based on incomplete information is not a good thing. It clearly says that you are biased.  
Again, people saying 'vedic period' are outside tradition and whatever they say after reading writings of others is useless to vaidikas.

gaNAnAntvA is itself veda. What other veda do you need ?  
How could you say that deity developed later ? Just because he is elaborately explained in purANas. According to vyAsa, etc. purANa are either explanation or helpful for understanding of veda. So, they describe only those things which are said in veda in bIja-rUpa even.

No scholar was such shameless and fearless of adharma as are now-a-days' people. So, elders didn't do that. And I don't know any people capable of doing this. Too much speculation is very bad and that too in negative direction.  
Moreover, which mantra is veda and which not is defined by paramparA of veda-pAThins and not by anyone.  
Some people say that, since sha\~Nkara-bhagavatpAda didn't explain such and such upaniShat, so I don't believe that upaniShat. This is wrong, because sha\~Nkara is not an authority on this subject. Same is true for people tainted with negative-speculations.
