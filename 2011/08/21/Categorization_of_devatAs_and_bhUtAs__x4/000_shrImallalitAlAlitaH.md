There was a discussion in a group about vinAyaka.  
bhAShyam of shrI sha\~Nkara-bhagavatpAda on gItA has counted either one or more of : vinAyaka, sapta-mAtR^ikA, rudra-pArShada, mAtR^i-gaNa, chaturbhaginI, yakSha, rakShaH, pishAcha, bhadrakAlI, durgA - as bhUta-gaNa or bhUta.  
  

1.  Now, people following vedas have a view that vinAyaka, etc. said as
    bhUta-gaNa are different from vinAyaka, etc. who are famous as
    devatA. 2.  People having inclination towards tantra say that commentators
    (mainly sha\~Nkara-bhagavatpAda) is against upAsanA of gaNesha, etc. 3.  Their is another view : even if vinAyaka, etc. are counted as both
    devatA and bhUta, it doesn't prove that vinAyaka is more than one.
    It just says that vinAyaka, etc. are subject of worships both as
    devatA and bhUta according to wish of worshiper. Commentaries of
    gItA just say their upAsanA as bhUta is tAmasa.  

This created big confusion.  
  
After reading many posts with little useful information, I came to know that talking without proof is useless in this case and most are doing the same.  
  
So, I checked all commentaries of gItA which were available. All say the same thing and repeat it at other places too. So, I can say that they were firm on their view. It proves that they had access to some standard text according to which they categorized vinAyaka, etc. as tAmasa.  
  
I want to know definitions of devatA, preta, bhUta, gaNa, etc., with quotes from scriptures, dictionaries, etc. So, please post whatever you know and is useful.  
  
  
After getting these definitions,  
  
If devatA and others are proved far different, and vinAyaka, etc. are counted as both devatA and bhUta, then view of vaidikas will gain some force.  
  
Even if vaidikas don't get any clear classification, tAntrikas have to show that their view of holding vinAyaka, etc. as devatA only has some proof. They may say it's popular belief or it is said as such in tantra, we remember vinAyaka, etc. as devatA in viniyoga, etc. of mantra ; but even then the cause of all commentaries being in same line will need explanation. In fact, commentaries of old people with same explanation will prove their view false and based on rumors, lack of deep study, etc.  
  
Third view fits more than other views in present condition. But, any proof of two vinAka, etc. will be enough to make it wrong.  
  
Please share your views regarding this. Arguments based on scriptures are most welcome.
