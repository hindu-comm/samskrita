I am not sure the following words offer any additional information, but i type in anyways -  
  
1. the 'paMchayatana-puja' that shrI sha\~jkara said to have constituted, has gaNapati in there. Since this is daily ritual for most of the vaidikas (depending on how you define this term), I don't believe its tantric. So this should rule out the possibility of gaNapathi being a non-devatA (only). Also, shrI sha\~jkara doesn't seem to be against gaNapati upasana.  
  
2. We offer explicit prayer to gaNapati as 'gaNAAMtwA gaNApatigms havAmahE', which is a vedic mantra, this should rule out the possibility of gaNapathi being a non-devatA (only).  
  
3. May be some explicit references would be there in 'gaNapati Adhwara shIrSha', but I can't mention off my head.  
  
I think there is a description of the terms in rAmayANa uttara kANDa.  
  
Now, a related but unrelated item - In bhAgavata, there is a mention of how viShnu is reborn in different manvantaras under various names (not the dashavatara). For example in a certain manvantara, he is born as a son of 'vikuNThi', and (hence) known as vaIkuNTha and has built a big city (?) called vaIkuNThaM. Lakshmi is also reborn and married him. We don't seem to distinguish between various such 'forms' of nArAyANa, we just worship one.  
  
May be vinAyakA also has similar forms, and that explains your query " is vinAyakA one or two ? '
