GaruDapurANa has the following verse:

  

GarPur, 1, 5, 37.2  
śambhor bhāryābhavad gaurī tasyāṃ jajñe**vināyakaḥ**  
  

to the effect that विनायक was born to शम्भु by his wife of गौरी and his worship to be observed by one who wants to have success in his deeds.

  

GarPur, 1, 51, 20.1  
karmaṇāṃ siddhikāmastu pūjayedvai**vināyakam**/

  

KurmapurANa also has the same line of GaruDa:

  

KūPur, 2, 26, 40.2  
karmaṇāṃ siddhikāmastu pūjayed vai**vināyakam**//

  

### Yājñavalkyasmṛti

  

[TABLE]

  

The last line of the reference in YajnavalkyasmRti draws attention. The leader of the गण-s need be one of them or not is another line of thinking. If he is considered as one of them, विनायक can be considered as गण like भृङ्गिरिटि, नन्दिकेश्वर etc. deformed figures prominent among the गण-s. He is worshiped with his mother too:

  

YāSmṛ, 1, 290.1  
**vināyakasya**jananīm upatiṣṭhet tato 'mbikām /



SkandaPurana has another line:

  

SkPur, 25, 31.2  
tvaṃ bhūto bhūtanetā ca nāyako 'tha**vināyakaḥ**/

  

which is too clumsy to arrive at any conclusion. In the context, Nandin is addressed as vinAyaka, as their head.

  

No decision can be arrived at conclusively from the above references.

  

With regareds
