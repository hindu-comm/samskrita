Etymological Explanation is one thing according to Grammar and their definition according to their usage in different schools/sects of Indian Philosophy/Religion (there has always been a great confusion between the overlapping nature of these two categories in the western view of these two terms in the broader sense) otherwise according to PurANa-s and Veda-s (BrahmaNa-s offer etymological explanation according to derivation following some episode).



Now, coming to the word, अमर classifies देव, असुर, यक्ष, गन्धर्व etc. divine, semi-divine categories without consideration of Puranic legends or Vedic passages. देव and देवता both are considered assynonoms signifiying gods in general. असुर, किंनर, etc. are celestial occupiants according to him.

  

According to my earlier cited quotations, one says there is a group of Vinayaka-s, for which it uses the word in plural: विनायक-s of which I do not have any idea. May be, one of them is considered as their head विनायक, and may be considered as the Tantric one. But Vedic विनायक appears in अथर्ववेद , in गणपत्यथर्वशीर्ष explicitly with the attires of the one described in पुराण-s.
