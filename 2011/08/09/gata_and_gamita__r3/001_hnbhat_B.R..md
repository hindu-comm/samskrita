It may be difficult to show the difference in English Translation as English Translation has to follows its own idiomatic expressions.

Translated properly, The Yaksha, deprived of his godly essence (mahimA) or divine attributes deprived of - by the curse ,,,,,,,,,,,, etc.

  

In Sanskrit syntax, they are grammatically the two forms are simple and causative (प्रेरक) forms of the verb of motion गम् - used as गच्छति, गमयति , of which past participle forms are गतः (-gone) - गमितः (caused to be gone). As it is intransitive verb in English, it cannot be used in passive participle, but in Sanskrit it has got a corresponding passive form. Generally, both would be translated simply lost and made lost as it is inanimate object here, the curse and the greatness. (by itself cannot go, unless if somebody causes it to be moved) for English. Here the loss of glory is caused by the curse. So no direct translation would fit the context in English. either as lost and made lost, or literally the translation of the Bahuvrihi compound, as adjective to Yaksha, as "deprived of his divine glory (power)"" by the curse (शापेन) which is the agent causing the deprivation (or loss) of it. 

  

This is the difference between the two terms.

gata - gone, gamita -caused to go , sent

  

  

गतोऽस्तमर्कः - The sun sets. (is English idiomatic sentence); literally: The sun gone beyond sight. (Astam - adarshanam)
