Dear Group,  
  
While looking for an online English-Sanskrit dictionary I hit upon  
  
'A Practical English-Sanskrit Dictionary, A to Falseness'  
by Anundoram Borooah at  
<http://books.google.com/books/reader>  
id=axkYAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader  
  
I had never heard earlier of Anundoram Borooah. Intrigued by the  
name, I carried out a Google search and came across a few websites  
dealing with his life, one of which is <http://www.amtron.in/htmls/Biography-of-ARB.html>  
  
He had a short life from 1850 to 1889. He was the first Assamese and  
the fifth Indian to make into the prestigious heaven-born Indian Civil  
Service. He was also a good Sanskrit scholar and had many plans to  
further his works in Sanskrit, including a dictionary from English to  
Sanskrit in three volumes. Apparently he completed two, when his life  
was cut short by untimely death at the age of 39. The first of these  
two volumes is available in Google e-books for purchase/free online  
reading at the URL given above.  
  
Looking to his accomplishments in his short life, one can only imagine  
what more he could have done for Sanskrit and oriental scholarship had  
he lived longer. At a time when almost all scholars of repute in  
Sanskrit, trained in the non-traditional way, came from Western  
countries, here was an Indian who, because of his non-traditional  
learning and the prestigious official position, could have held on his  
own among them but that was not to be...!
