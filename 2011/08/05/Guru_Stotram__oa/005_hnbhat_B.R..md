Here is Shree Gurvashtakam which is different from the Shree Guru Stotram:



<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/guru8mean.pdf>



no indication of the author except the commentator indicating it is ascribed to Sri Shankaracharya. The commentary is in English.



Shree Gurupaadukaa Stotra is available in audio rendered by Bombay Sisters along with Sri DakshiNaMoorthy Stotra.



It is a stotra(Ashtaka)by Sri Shankaracharya in eight versesin highly philosophical content with Suresvaaracharya's Vartika and Prakashananda Yati's. It is available with translation also. Both are available in [archive.org](http://archive.org) with translation and without translation. Here is the link to Sri Gurupaadukaastotram:



<http://www.svbf.org/journal/vol1no3/paduka.pdf>



The Dakshinamoorthy Stotra is downloadable in [archive.org](http://archive.org)with the commentaries and with English Translation also.This too ends with



तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये।



at the end of each stanza.



There may befew more Stotra-s dedicated to Guru. But all need not be the same and or different versions ofa single stotra.
