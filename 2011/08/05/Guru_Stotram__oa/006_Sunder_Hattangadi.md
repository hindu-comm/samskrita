Saluatations are to that guru who showed me the abode--  
the one who is to be known--whose form is the entire  
universe and by whom all the movables (animals) and  
immovables are pervaded . (l)  
Salutations to that guru who opened the eyes of the one  
blind due to the darkness (cover) of ignorance with the  
needle (coated) with the ointment of knowledge . (2)  
Salutations to that guru, who is the Creator, Sustainer,  
and Destroyer and who indeed is the limitless Brahman . (3)  
Salutations to that teacher who showed me the one to be  
known, who permeates whatever that is movable and immovable,  
sentient and insentient . (4)  
Salutations to that teacher who showed me (by teaching)  
the pervader of all three worlds comprising the sentient  
and insentient . (5)  
Salutations to that guru who is the sun to the lotus of  
VedAnta and whose lotus feet are made radiant by the  
jewel of all Shrutis (UpaniShads). (The guru is  
established in the vision of the Shruti and is the one  
by whom the Shruti blossoms forth.) (6)  
Salutations to that guru who is Awareness, changeless  
(beyond time), who is peace, beyond space, pure (free  
from rAga and dveSha) and who is beyond the manifest  
and unmanifest (NAda, Bindu, etc.) (7)  
Salutations to that guru who is rooted in knowledge  
that is power, adorned with the garland of Truth and  
who is the bestower of the joy of liberation . (8)  
Salutations to that guru who by bestoying the knowledge  
of the Self burns up the bondage created by accumulated  
actions of innumerable births . (9)  
Salutations to that guru; the perennial flow of wisdom  
from the one rooted in the vision of the Shhruti dries  
up totally the ocean of transmigration (saMsAra) and  
reveals (teaches) the essence of all wealth (the fullness,  
freedom from want). (10)  
There is nothing superior to knowledge of truth; no  
truth higher than the truth, and there is no purifying  
austerity better than the truth; salutations to that  
guru . (11)  
Prostrations to that guru who is my Lord and who is  
the Lord of the Universe, my teacher who is the teacher  
of the Universe, who is the Self in me, and the Self  
in all beings . (12)  
Salutations to that guru who is the beginning and the  
beginningless, who is the highest Deity and to whom  
there is none superior . (13)  
Oh God of all Gods! You alone are my mother, father,  
kinsman, friend, the knowledge, and wealth . You are  
to me everything . (14)
