bahu dhanyavAdaH sarvebhyaH



The version that I have seems to have been pulled from various bits ofthe Guru Gita and has some crossover with the last of Sunder's links below (which is the same as the Chinmayananda one others sent), but is otherwise quite different. Perhaps the version I have is a traditional family shortened(it is only 7 or 8 verses) version of the Guru Gita.

At any rate, you have solved my query, so thank you again.
