there is this slokam advised to me by a saintly person. This is from the Ramayana,



" Mrugah Pakshino damshakah echa dustah

tatha vyadhayo padakha ye Matangey

Bhavadakshi Dikshna grabhinnah chaturey

vinashyanthu che choornitha krouncha shaila"



to be recited 48 times in the morning and evening.



regards

Kuppuswamy
