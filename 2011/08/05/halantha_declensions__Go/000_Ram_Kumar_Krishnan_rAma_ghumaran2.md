Respected veterans,

  

I was going through sabda manjari and i perplexed seeing so many declensions for various noun ending words (हलन्थ ) . for example तकारन्त नंपुसक has been given 5 different kind of declensions (जगत्, ददत्,मरुत्,तुदत्,पचत) . I want to learn these somehow but its very difficult to memorize all these different forms. Is there any easy way to do this.
