PM and the question of foreign origin



A STORY FROM HITOPADESA



Hitopadesa was written about 1500 years ago. Hitopadesa means good advice. The author  
himself says that he has taken most of the stories from Panchatantra. All situations  
are given in the form of stories using birds and animals as characters.



In the country of land birds a peacock named Chitravarna was the king.
He had a  
visitor called Diirghamukha, a crane from the country of water birds.
Chitravarna’s  
PM was a vulture named Duuradarshi. He enquired from Diirghamukha who the king and PM  
were in his country. He gave their names as Hiranyagarbha, a swan and Chakrvaaka, a  
goose. Duuradarshi opined that it was very proper that Chakravaka was the PM as he  
was born in the same country.



He supported this by a saying -



svadeshajaM kulaachaara-vishuddhaM upadhaa-shuchim.

mantraj\~naM avyasaninaM vyabhichaara-vivarjitam ..

adhiita-vyavahaaraarthaM maulaM khyaataM vipashchitam.

arthasyotpaadakaM chaiva vidadhyaat mantriNaM nR^ipaH ..



The king should appoint a Prime Minister who should

have the following attributes.



svadeshajaH (born in the same country ),

kulaachaara-vishuddhaH (correct in observing the

traditions of the family/community/country ),

upadhaashuchiH (of tested loyalty),

mantraj\~naH (a good advisor),

avyasanii (not addicted to any vice),

vyabhichaara-vivarjitaH (not deviating from the right course),

adhiitavyavaharaarthaH (well versed in administrative matters),

maulaH (of good family),

khyaataH (a celebrity),

vipashchit(learned),

arthasyotpaadakaH (a generator of wealth)
