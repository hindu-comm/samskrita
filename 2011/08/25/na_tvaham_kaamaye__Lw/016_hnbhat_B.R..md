I doesn't matter whether it is written joined or as separate words (possible in Roman script) but the meaning doesn't differ in any way as they are two words as they are translated in other messages.

  

प्राणिनामार्तिनाशनम् - प्राणिनाम् आर्तिनाशनम् -

praaninaamaartinaashanam orpraaninaam aartinaashanam

  

Meaning the same:

the getting rid of sufferings of the living beings.
