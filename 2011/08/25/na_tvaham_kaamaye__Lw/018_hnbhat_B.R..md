Dear Ajit Gargeswari,

  

I don't know whether BHU motto as quoted by Namboodirippad as above, (I have reproduced his message) or as you have quoted from Bhagavadgita.

  

Anyhow, the lines you have quoted have many errors that could not have made it as the motto of a large popular University as you have quoted. The real lines of the Bhagavadgita is as follows:

  
अहं वैश्वानरो भूत्वा प्राणिनां देहमाश्रितः ।  
प्राणापानसमायुक्तः पचाम्यन्नं चतुर्विधम्॥  

  

and I could not follow your interpretation of it and relevancy of the subsequent explanation to the thread too.
