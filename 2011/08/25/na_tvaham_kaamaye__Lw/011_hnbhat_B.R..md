I think it should be cakamethe form you cited, derived from the simple stem kam- + perfect tense as the aorist forms will not be such, as given below.The other optional form will be कामयांचक्रे, कामयामास, कामयांबभूव.
like एधांचक्रे etc.

  

Again, it is the most unusual form according to Paninian system, is the aoristic one. As acknowledged by Bhashya, under the Vartika,

  

(पा-३,१.४८; अकि-२,५५.२-१६; रो-३,१३८-१३९; भा-१/२४) णिश्रिद्रुस्रुषु कमेः उपसङ्ख्यानम् । णिश्रिद्रुस्रुषु कमेः उपसङ्ख्यानम् कर्तव्यम् ।

  

by virtue of which we get अचकमत  in the aorist

for the normal form अचीकमत।

derived corresponding toकामयते। Hence, after citing this Vartika, he cites a verse, which states that thethe users of thisspecial form (derived according to the Vartika), :

  

नाकम् इष्टमुखम् यान्ति सुयुक्तैः वडवारथैः ।

  

go to the celestial region (svarga) which provides all the pleasure of their choise,

  

अथ पत्काषीणः यान्ति ये अचीकमतभाषिणः ।\|



And, those who use the (normal) form अचीकमत go stroll over. with galling feet.

  

So he commends the special usages of words than normal ones. MW gives the form under अचीकमत under Causative, but in the 1st conjugation, he gives अचकमत. 

  

The other special usages are noted by MW also

  

Ë to wish , desire , long for (with acc. or inf. or Pot. P‚². 3-3 , 157

Ë e.g. {kAmaye@bhuJjIta@bhavAn} , I wish your worship may eat

Ë {kAmaye@dAtum} , I wish to give K‚½.) RV. AV. TS. MBh. &c.

  

The special feature of the verb is that it is used with the form corresponding to the 10 conjugation (णिच्) even without causative sense and is conjugated without the णिङ् suffix innot used in the non-conjugational suffixed tenses (according to Paninan terminology आर्धधातुक suffixed conjugations) with the simple stem (kam+) as listed by MW. It is only a difference of approach.

  

It is always conjugated in the Atmanepada, whereas causative or 10th conjugation(according to MW), it may take परस्मैपद also. कामयति.
