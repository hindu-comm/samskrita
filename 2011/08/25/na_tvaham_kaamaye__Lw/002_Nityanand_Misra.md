To preserve the metre, there must be sandhi between "na" and "apunarbhavam" and also "praaninaamaartinaashanam" is one word.  
  
न त्वहं कामये मोक्षं न स्वर्गं नापुनर्भवम्  
कामये दुःखतप्तानां प्राणिनामार्तिनाशनम्  
  
na tvahaṃ kāmaye mokṣaṃ na svargaṃ nāpunarbhavam  
kāmaye duḥkhataptānāṃ prāṇināmārtināśanam
