There is the difference between moksham and rAjyam also - where rAjyam seems a materialistic (kingdom) goal but moksham is spiritual release.  
  
There is also the interesting use of the kAma as a verb - Atmanepada cl 1, present tense instead for the more usual Apnomi or icchAmi. The more usual stem is aorist - cikame, according to MW.
