But according to Panini, it is a simple present tense form in the first person singular of the verb कम् - कान्तौ; (√**कम्**(कमुँ**कान्तौ = desire**१.

५११) which takes the suffix णि in the simple form itself. Ref. "कमेर्णिङ्" (3.1.30) conjugated aswhich you can find in the conjugation table (of the verb itself meaning to desire/wish).कामयते - etc.

Pardon if I can't understand your remark fully and not the word काम used as verb as you seemed to think. 

  

Thanks Arvind for pointing out the defect in my posting in the verse. He is right and some how it was deleted. Sorry for for not noticing it before posting.
