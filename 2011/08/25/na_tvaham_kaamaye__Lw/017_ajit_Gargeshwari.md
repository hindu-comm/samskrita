Dear Namboothiripad  
  
This verse word is a part of Bhagavat gita. The entire verse is as follows  
Aham vishva naro bhutva pranimam dehamashritha  
Pranad panasamayuktaha pachani annam chatur Vidham  
  
This sholka is recited along with Bramarpanam Brmah Havih etc before eating food. Vivekananda once said Indian speak religiously, eat religiously and sleep religiously. A translation of this verse can be given by any scholar of this group.  
Naturally Sri Madan Mohan Malavya believed in the policy eat to live and not live to eat.  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
