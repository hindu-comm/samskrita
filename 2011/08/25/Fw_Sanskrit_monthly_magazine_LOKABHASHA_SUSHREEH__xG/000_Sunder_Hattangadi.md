Dear Sanskrit lover ,  
We are publishing a Sanskrit monthly magazine "LOKABHASHA SUSHREEH" containing interesting information on Science, Veda, Vedic Science, Vedic values etc. I wish it will be interesting to be read by a sanskrit knowing person. Can I send you a PDF copy of our current issue. Also we request you or your sanskrit knowing friends and members of your organisation to send an interesting article in Sanskrit language to be published in our monthly magazine. It may be from Science, Hindu ritual and traditions, great vedic sages, Vedic quizzes, General Knowledge etc. waiting for your reply and cooperation in this regard.
