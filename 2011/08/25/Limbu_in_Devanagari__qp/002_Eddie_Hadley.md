Sunder,



So, I am on the right track.



I learn that Limbu is also known as Kirati.

And it really is a small world, the Serving British Ghurkha (Gorka) Regiment, from those regions, are stationed at their barracks, just 40 mile from where I live.

And it would appear to be their script, also.



The script itself, though, looks rather different from Devanāgarī, so I presume it an alternative that they are known to write in.



Many thanks,



Eddie

All,



 Not really Samskrita, but in connection with the script in which is often written, I have come across a reference to a ‘Limbu’ script in the IAST Unicode code block for Devanāgarī.





In the Chandas Font, it displays correctly.

But in case it doesn’t, it looks very much like a small question mark in the Latin script. With the ‘glyph variant’ the same, but with a long bar on top:





Glottal stop

 ॽ DEVANAGARI LETTER GLOTTAL STOP (Code Point 097D)

 used for writing Limbu in Devanagari

 a glyph variant has the connecting top bar



I’m not looking for detail, just confirmation that I have the right ‘Limbu’, as its a script that I have not heard of before.



Google has it as the script of the peoples of the [Himalayan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalaya "Himalaya") Region, of East Nepal and so on.

Putting the emphasis on the peoples (tribes) rather than Geographical regions.



It is the only code point out of the 127 used, that mentions ‘Limbu’.



Thanks in advance,



 Eddie
