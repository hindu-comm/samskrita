Anyhow I opted not to reply to this thread. But seeing the replies in "advaita" group and in our group, I am tempted to reply.

  

I am not sure whether it is अद्य or आद्य ब्रह्मणः

  

Plainly speaking अद्य means today, this day and the next part of the "sankalpa" ends with the "tithi""vaara" and "nakshatra" as I have heard. Taking from an end, commenting is not sounding ... and the predication .... karma kariShye.

  

I don't know the calculation of kalpa, manvantara, yuga, ....... till date the "sankalpa" specifies the day and date I perform this rite in this place (varsha, dvipa, khanda etc.) specific about the place and date of the performance of the rite intended (which is called saMkalpa - the announcement of the intended rite) .

  

I can see many messages coming in. May be more information available in those.
