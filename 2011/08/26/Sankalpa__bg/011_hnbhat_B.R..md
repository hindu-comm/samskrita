According to poets परार्ध is the maximum number countable whether you count in millions or billions.

  

अस्य क्षोणिपतेः परार्धपरय्ला लक्ष्यीकृताः संख्यया

  

..................बधिरप्रख्याः किलाकीर्तयः॥

  

in which Sriharsha, the great Scholar poet has used this word as the maximum number, beyond which counting cannot be done, amounting nothing beyond परार्ध = nil. This the convention of poets. He has listed obviously among the other impossible things, as the last one बधिरप्रख्याः sung by the dumb, the defames of the king (described) meaning totally absent.

  

The two conventions may differ and one with the mathematicians calculation in which there is no indefinite number and the other PurANa-s imagined calculation पर (the maximum life time) usually 100 years. as you also may be aware, शतमानं भवति शतायुः शतं जीवेम शरदां शतम्। living full life. In this sense, the life time maximum is calculated into 100 years and first half and second half is meant in the Puranic tradition.

  

Now it is up to you whether you begin counting with the परार्ध number up to the present day or from the second half of the life time of Brahma, in which श्वेतवराहकल्प comes the current कल्प.
