In all sankalapas the time, place and purpose of what is going to be done are mentioned.

  

In mentioning the time it mentions at what point of time a person is performing the ritual.

  

So it gives reference to Brahma and his age. adya-brahmanah means of the present Brahma.

There are several Brahmas. Brahma creates and after several billions of years of Srishti starts going back which is called Layam.  Again after going back to the original point comes out.

Then another Brahma comes into existence. That is why it is referred to as adya i.e. todays

Brahmanah. 

  

A brahma life is two parardhas of 50 years each. Todays Brahma has completed 50 years

of one parardha. 

  

His age is mentioned as dvitiiye parardhe -------  kaliyuge prathame paade etc.

  

It is a mind boggling calculation to be posted. Those interested can go to websites mentioning

these in great detail.
