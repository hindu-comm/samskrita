Thanks for providing the exact text possible and your calculation overwhelming arguments.

  

Only I was concerned with आद्य or अद्य as they were typed in roman in the initial sentence would sound alike. अद्य means today or अस्मिन् अहनि and not synonym to एतद् this. Then if you want to make compound with ब्रह्म or ब्रह्मणः कल्प with or without compound related to ब्रह्मणः is left to your choice. I don't find any reason to disagree or agree with it on grammatical grounds. But such a compound should be treated as extra-ordinary, if you relate it to ब्रह्मन् than current year and day and date which is normal.

  

I have no comments on the disagreement between the Purana-s and SmRti and Veda-s. They can be carried out to any extent with numbers and meanings of words flexible in Sanskrit easily.

  

As far as I know, there is no correspondence in the process of creation as explained in PuraNa-s and the Veda-s (if any other than the popular concepts as in तैत्तिरीय upanishat and in others) that can relate it with the creation of Brahma and the "kalpa" concept.

  

Anyway, thanks for mind-blogging calculation of the present year and date announced in the "saNkalpa" according to the reading "आद्य" instead. I am averse to such calculations. Anybody interested can verify the calculations.

  

One more query for you our of curiosity :

1.    
2.    
3.  parashurAmakSetre, 4.  bauddhAvatAre,shAlivAhanashakavarSe,trINitrINiuttaranavashataadhikasahasra(for
    1933 Shaka year) tameshakAbde,asminvartamAnavyAvahArike

After the specification of the region, between the परशुरामक्षेत्रे and शालिवाहनशकवर्षे ourbauddhAvatAre, appears. It is hard to co-relate it with preceding and following part for me. How it is related and what part does it play in the saNkalpa? Though I also had heard this word for many years, I had never thought of it. May the period of बौद्धावतार is meant in the शकवर्ष again stumbling upon the issue of Buddha-s (or Buddha?) raised and discussed long in another thread. But here just I wanted to know its relation with the next part following and in that case "Buddha" (whether Avatara or historical - again there is the confusion who was the founder of बुद्ध philosophy) was born after शालिवाहन शक वर्ष (avatara of Buddha related with शकवर्ष) as it presupposes the relation in between the sentence.
