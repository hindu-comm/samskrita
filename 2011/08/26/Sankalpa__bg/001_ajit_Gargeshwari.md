Hi,  
  
aadhya brahmana means "I a Bramhin of this age". During medieval ages it was a practice to mention ones cast first even before his name. A mans cast was very important. A person has to mention his caste before he takes a Vow (Sankalpa) at the beginning of any ritual. When one takes a vow one has to mention time, place, means employed to fulfill the vow and purpose of the ritual. ( very similar to an Abstract of a research paper). The entire sentence means in this I a Bramhin in the first part of Kaliyuaga ( Kaliyuge prathma Pade), In the reign of Bharatas ( Bharatha varsha), in the Part ruled by Bharatas ( Bharata Kaande) in Island of Jambu ( Jambudvepe) and so on.
