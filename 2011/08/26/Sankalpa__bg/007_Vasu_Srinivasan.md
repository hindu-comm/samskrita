aadya brahmaNa: - (lit. "of current brahman") - refers to the brahma of the present time. In this Brahma's time, in second half (51st year), in shvetavaraha kalpa, vaivashvata manvantara (7th manvantara), etc.  
  
after this brahma, the next brahma is Hanuman. That's why the specific reference to 'current brahman'...  
  
could aadya etymologically mean "from the first?" im not so sure.. "From the first" would be "aadE:". - if samasa then would be just aadibrahmaNa:.  
  
To me "aadya" looks like an avyaya. Correct me if im wrong..
