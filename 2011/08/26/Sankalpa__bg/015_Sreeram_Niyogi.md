Who wrote this below meaning with half knowledge? iT IS TOTALLY WRONG.

  

SANKALPA DEFINES THE ULTIMATE TIME UNIT FOLLOWED BY THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. (TIME AND SPACE)

  

TIME UNIT

Adya Brahmana - indicates that the age of PRESENT BRAHMA. "PARAM" is the "TIME UNIT" which represents the FULL-LIFE-SPAN of BRAHMA.

Dwiteeya Paraardhe means, the second Half of the PARAM (second half of the life span of present Brahma).  

Sweta Varaaha Kalpe (The present Kalpa's name is Sweta Varaha Kalpam (2 Kalpa's are 1 day of Brahma)

Vaivaswata Manvantare (in Sweta Varaha Kalpa, we are in Vaivaswata Manwantara, THERE ARE TOTAL 14 MANVANTARAS constitutes of 72 "MAHA-YUGAS, EACH MAHAYUGA HAVE 4 YUGAS (KRUTA YUGA, TRETA YUGA DWAPARA YUGA AND KALIYUGA)

Kaliyuge pradhama paade (We are in the first phase of Kaliyuga)

  

SPACE (PHYSICAL LOCATION FROM WHERE YOU ARE DOING THIS SANKALPA FROM)

Jampu Dweepe ( This is the EARTH)

Bharata Varshe ( This is a vast land, the Asian landmass which spreads right from southern tip of India up to the plans planes of middle-east Asia)

Bharata Khande (this is the AARYAVARTA which is current India, from Himalayas to Kanyakumari

Meroh Dakshina Dikbhage (the land mass situated South to the MERU Parvata(Mt Kailash in Himalayas)

  

And then continues and further narrows down to...................depends upon the physical location of one who is doing this SANKALPA
