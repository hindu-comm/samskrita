Here is a Foot Note on the BhagavatapuraNa narration of the present creation after the Pralaya:

  

  

Our 1000 four yuga-s = 1 day or "kalpa" of Brahma.

1000 four yuga-s - 1 night of Brahma;

our 2000 x 4 yuga-s - 1 day and night;

360 days of Brahma - 1 year of Brahma;

100 years of Brahma - the complete life of Brahma which is duration of the great deluge also.(Pralaya).

  

Brahma's age is called Para (पर) being the ever known life time. He has now completed one half that complete age, and now it is the first Part of his life. This is called prathama-para+ardha. He has completed 50 years and 51st year is continuing.

So 50 x 360 days - i.e. 18 000 kalpa-s. The first "kalpa" is called Brahma and the last is called Padma. The current "kalpa" is श्वेतवराहकल्प as given in the notes on the नारायणीय verse 8.4 and the process of creation is described in 3rd skandha of Bhagavata too.

  

How this will be reckoned with the "sankalpa" is left to the calculation beginning from the shvetavaraha-kalpa, present manvantara, and kaliyuga and paada of it and days enumerated by astrologers in calculating the days in Pancanga. Here I am at a loss to reckon.

  

आद्य means the first and अद्य means this day/today. अस्मिन् अहनि - अद्य is the etymology. आदौ भवः - आद्यः and it is not indeclinable in any case, while the first अद्य is अव्यय.



The rest is left to you members to carry on the discussion and arrive at any conclusion that will properly justify the purpose announced in the संकल्प.
