Shambhu Shastriji,

  

Thanks for the number provided by you. "ParArdha" is the maxmimum number of the possible counting. It is said it is the last digit of counting.

  

Anyhow, in the present content, the "saNkalpa" अद्य/आद्य -/ + ब्रह्मणः द्वितीयपरार्धे or परार्धे is the question. The query may please be solved by our Shastriji and the meaning was asked for.

  

Whether it is आद्यब्रह्मणः द्वितीयपरार्धे श्वेतवराहकल्पे - It means in the Second परार्ध beginning from the first Brahma (in this case it needs some more calculation as it presupposes two परार्ध-s of the first Brahma). If it is अद्य, it is referring to the second परार्ध of Brahma's life time, in which श्वेतवराहकल्प (a day of Brahma's creation in). As quoted by Narayana Bhattathiri,

  

पञ्चाशदब्दममुना स्ववयोऽर्धरूपम्, एकं परार्धमतिवृत्य हि वर्तते ऽसौ॥

  

which makes it the second of of Brahma's life span in which the second half is now continuing, in which the first day श्वेतवराहकल्प is the present कल्प, in which the present मन्वन्तर is वैवस्वत (i.e. beginning from Manu, the son of VivasvAn), of the 14th Manu-s, in which the current कलियुग ........and so on ends with the current date and time of the संकल्प as I can remember (not complete sentence. but recalling from from memory). This seems to be the basis for the द्वितीय-परार्ध. Otherwise, you have to take the life span of Brahma being 2 परार्ध or more, in which case परार्ध-s may become indefinite. Which has to be reckoned with the accounts offered in PurANa-s.

  

Anyhow you are here, to solve the mystery for me as I am not personally involved in the discussion.
