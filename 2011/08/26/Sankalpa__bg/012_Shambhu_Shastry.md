AdaraNIya Bhat ji,

  

My pATa has been adya brahmaNo… (not Adya brahmaNo….), i.e., in the present brahma’s, etc. My (coastal Karnataka Havyaka) tradition has the below version for the desha-kAla sankIrtanA portion of the generic sankapla (shown on four lines along the changing themes, with a few commas, for aiding clarity ofinterpretations):

1.  shrI kr\`SNa kr\`SNa adya bhagavato mahApuruSasya vAsudevasya
    viSNo(ranujnayA)rAjnayA, 2.  pravartamAnasya adya brahmaNo dvitIye (divitIya) parArdhe,
    shvetavarAha kalpe, vaivasvata manvantare, asta vimshati tame
    kaliyuge prathama pAde, 3.  jambUdvIpe, bhAratavarSe, bharatakhande, merordakSiNa pArshve,
    gorAstra deshe, gokarNa maNdale, parashurAma kSetre, 4.  bauddhAvatAre, shAlivAhana shakavarSe, trINi trINi uttara navashata
    adhika sahasra (for 1933 Shaka year) tame shakAbde, asmin vartamAna
    vyAvahArike….?samvastare -?ayane-?
    r\`tau-?mAse-?pakSe-?tithau-?vAsara yuktAyAm….

In the split-up above, lines 1, 2 and 4 address the kAla, and line 3 addresses the desha. Line 3 is modified depending on the location on the Earth.



Line 1 is suggestive of our existential kAla chakra within the control of our galaxy (adya bhagavato viSNoH anujnayA or AjnayA) – cf. ‘soma maNdalAdhipataye viSNave namaH’ in our panchAyatana nitya pUjA.



[Comment](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/advaitin/message/53412) on the Advaita list does not make much sense.

  

As for why it is 'adya' and not 'Adya', I can't address it cryptically; some background needs covered. Naresh ji hopefully will approve this long note.



First, some posers:

1.  How many kalpas in the dvitIya parArdha have passed is not stated
    (assumption is that it is zero but where is the pramANa?) 2.  Year is not counted from kaliyuga prathama pAda, but from
    Shalivahana era (if the other eras and their durations in the
    bauddhaavataara are assumed known elsewhere, and the bauddhaavataara
    commenced with kali yuga, there is nothing missing - we can fill in
    the blanks) 3.  parArdha as an uncountable (or the largest countable) number does
    not make sense. We can set aside views of Shriharsha and other
    literary figures, while respecting their command on the language but
    not on the shAstras, but accept what the shAstras and shruti say.
    pUrNa is the uncountable (infinite) in the shruti. Later
    Hindu/Buddhist scholars reassigned the values to the shruti
    enumerated tens’ multipliers. So there is a mess of interpretation
    for parArdha. For example, arbuda (abbuda) became 10 power 56 (ref.
    wiki link below). 4.  Just for fun, the largest number named is Bukeshuo bukeshuo
    zhuan10³⁷²¹⁸³⁸³⁸⁸¹⁹⁷⁷⁶⁴⁴⁴⁴¹³⁰⁶⁵⁹⁷⁶⁸⁷⁸⁴⁹⁶⁴⁸¹²⁸, which appeared as
    Bodhisattva's maths in the Avataṃsaka Sūtra
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_large_numbers>.

Sankalpa for special ceremonies stretches to several pages, right out of the purANas, detailing every word in the above generic sankapla, such as naming all the manvantaras, the four yugas, detail of the seven dvIpas and the jambUdvIpa, the ten varSas in the jambUdvIpa, all the khandas in the bhAratavarSa, and so on.



Arriving at the age of our universe (Ayu of the very first brahma in this cycle of universal creation) based on this sankapla, the chaturyuga counting, and purANa notes thereupon has many problems.

-   First, all these purANa commentaries and even Amara’s meaning for
    daivI varSa (not purANa verses per se) contradict Manusmtr\`ti
    (chapter 1), an authoritative shastra overriding any purANa on
    matters not perceptible to our senses. Funny as is, none quotes
    Manusmr\`ti regarding the chaturyuga cycle duration. Manusmr\`ti’s
    commentator kallUka bhatta takes refuge in viSNu purANa to interpret
    it – resorting to a less authoritative text to interpret a more
    authoritative and older text! This was a time when purANas held the
    sway. -   Second, the chaturyuga scheme is a calendar scheme limited to our
    galaxy (soma maNdala), which is a mere spec in the Adya brahma’s
    full cosmos. It is quite a stretch to find temporal connections from
    our soma maNdala to the Adya brahma’s brahmANda. I am not yet sure;
    I think there are mix-ups and logical holes in the purANas regarding
    these matters of shAstra. -   Third, purANas’ purpose is not technical precision but driving home
    for the masses the sole importance of ‘Ashraya’. The other aspects
    (story of creation, geography, time cycles, kings’ lineages, etc.)
    of the purANas are incidental and secondary; they are there only to
    impress that the Almighty alone is the final refuge.

Therefore, for the creation and time cycle aspects, we may take shAstra as primary over the purANas, and go with Manusmr\`ti (until we have a better authority), which only has a clear and precise account of the yugas, manvantaras, and kalpas - all these pertain within our galactic neighborhood.



Therefore, “adya brahmaNo” may be the right thing to say in the sankalpa.



It is not Adya brahma (i.e., the very first brahma) of this universe.

  

Below are the additional arguments based on Manusmr\`ti and following Yogi Yukteshwar ji. Learned members may please scrutinize.

1.  Kali through kr\`ta yuga durations in 1:2:3:4 proportions add to
    12,000 earthly years, called devAnAM yugam (Manusmr\`ti 1-66 to 71).
    The ‘varSa’ defined in the Manusmr\`ti as comprising of the two
    ayanas can no way be twisted into ‘daivI varSa = 360 mAnuSa varSa.’ 2.  1000 deva-yugas are equal in duration to a day of our own Aditya
    (arka) maNdalAdhipati brahma (not Adya brahma). He is the “adya
    brahma”. Proof: In our nitya pUjA’s pita pUjA part, we say, “Aditya
    maNdalAdhipataye brahmaNe namaH.” There is also a practice in the
    nitya pUjA as “aum aM arkamaNdalAya dvAdasha kalAtmane namaH, aum uM
    soma maNdalAya Sodasha kalAtmane namaH, aum maM vahni maNdalAya
    dasha kalAtmane namaH.” The akAra-ukAra-makAras here make the aum,
    springing respectively from the arka (solar), soma (galactic), and
    vahni (galaxy cluster) maNdalas – the three successive higher
    paridhis. 3.  Another 1000 of these chaturyugas = our brahma’s night (Manusmr\`ti
    1-72). 4.  Thus, the 2000-chaturyugas’ duration is our brahma’s one ahorAtri
    cycle as the Aditya maNdala (solar-system-as-a-whole) spins on its
    axis and also goes around in the soma maNdala, around viSNunAbhi
    (from which brahma sprang up through ka-mala shoot – cf. purANa
    imagery). We say in our nitya pUjA, “soma maNdalAdhipataye viSNeve
    namaH”. kshIra sAgara mathanA is the story of the birth of our
    brahma and all his children (deva-asuras, yakSas, gandharvas,
    grahas, chandras, plants, animals, manuSyas, and the rest). 5.  Now, Manusmr\`ti being sutra-like, a little more reflection and
    analysis are needed. On a time-scale, since all celestial motions
    are cyclical, the yugas ascend and then descend, i.e., if we
    commence counting from satya (kr\`ta) yuga through treta, dvApara,
    and kali, then kali, dvApara, treta, and satya must follow. This
    24,000-year cycle then repeats, just as our nominal 12-hour day
    followed by the 12-hour night repeats (google Yogi Yukteshwar ji to
    read more on it). This 24,000-year cycle is a natural cycle of the
    seasons on our earth tied to the precession of earth’s rotational
    axis and earth’s elliptical orbit around the Sun. This is called
    apsidal motion in astronomy. purANa commentators missed this
    ArohaNa-avarohaNa in any natural cycle (Jaina tradition retained
    it), and they also threw in a 360 factor with no pramANa. With these
    two “corrections” we arrive at a picture consistent with
    Manusmr\`ti, shruti, and modern astronomy. 6.  Thus we have 500 of the 24,000-year yuga cycles forming our
    brahma’s one kalpa (either a day or a night). 7.  Two consecutive kalpas = 1000 of the 24,000-year yuga cycles = 24
    million earthly years = our adya brahma’s one ahorAtri. 8.  35 of the 24,000-year cycle + the following 12,000-year chaturyugas
    = one manvantara duration (Manusmr\`ti 1-79). In a 28-nakSatra
    scheme of equally dividing the sky, the apsidal axis moves by one
    nakSatra division through this duration. The 14 manvantaras repeat
    (ArohaNa-avarohaNa). Manusmr\`ti states that there have been
    ‘countless’ (asankhyAni) such manvantaras (Manusmr\`ti 1-80). 9.  Thus, with respect to the ‘fixed’ nakSatras, the apsidal axis moves
    360 degrees in 994 of the 24,000-year yuga cycles. Six more of these
    cycles are needed to complete Aditya maNdala’s one ahorAtri cycle,
    since, by then, it itself has moved around the galactic center by a
    few (about 2) degrees. purANa commentators messed here by throwing
    in all sorts of sandhi or sandhyA durations to "reconcile" the
    manvantaras within brahma ahorAtri. Simple celestial process was
    lost from the picture. 10. This is similar to our earthly experience: on an average, earth
    rotates one full round (with respect to the nakSatras) in a little
    less than 24 hours (23 hr 56 m 4.1 s - this is the sidereal
    duration); about four more minutes are needed to see the Sun again
    in our ahorAtri cycle. 11. The above (#9) gives us a way to estimate the duration of our adya
    brahma’s one year - it comes to about 333 kalpas = 3.996 billion
    years. Per modern astronomy, it is about 21 kalpas \~ 250 million
    years (My), and there is some error somewhere, either in the
    astronomy or in the shastra or in my analysis. The astronomers’
    research paper states that the observed positional shift of a star
    near our galactic center was measured with respect to a far distant
    star during a 7-year duration, and the 250-My time was deduced. This
    may not be the final answer. 12. Our Sun is estimated to be 4.57 billion years young and is expected
    to last (radiate light) that many more years, per modern astronomy’s
    pratyakSa-aitihya-anumAna pramANas. A dim or dark Sun will exist
    after that. 13. Is there a shastra/shruti pramANa for purANa commentators’ claim
    that parArdha = 50 years (or para = 100 years) of our present brahma
    (or of the Adya brahma)? Why not take parArdha in the sankalpa as a
    single word (shruti pramAna = 10e12) and denote it as our adya
    brahma’s one year (since it is of the order of 10e12, i.e.,
    parArdha, earthly days)? 14. Further, if (a big IF) we assume that ours is the first kalpa in our
    brahma’s second year, his current age works out to be 4 billion
    years. The error would equal the kalpas missed counted in the
    dvitIya parArdha (of the sankalpa). If the current astronomy
    assessment of Sun’s age is accepted, we may conjecture that about 47
    kalpas (564 My) have elapsed in the dvitIya parArdha prior to the
    present kalpa. 15. The above analysis gives the time passed in this shvetavarAha kapla
    and age of the humanoids, till the beginning of the present kali
    yuga, as 5.436 My (= 6 manvantaras + 27 chaturyuga durations). This
    is in striking agreement with all archeological evidences on the age
    of the humanoids. 16. Nothing can be said about the age of the universe (Adya brahma) from
    any of these yuga, manvantara, and kalpa considerations. All we can
    say is that it is at least 4 billion years old, since our own Aditya
    maNdala is 4 billion years old.

BhavadIyaH,

Shambhu
