As it is adjective to ताण्डव (m.n.) here used in neuter gender and the बह्व्रीहि compound always take the gender of the noun which is intended to be qualified it. In case you take चण्डताण्डवम् as used in masculine gender, then the second option is there. You can take it as adverb which invariably warrants neuter gender and accusative singular case. In either cases, it will be in the neuter gender, accusative singular form of \*डमरु and not alone it is डमरु. If it were a तत्पुरुषः (which is not the case here), then you can have masculine gender.

Not necessary anyway. There is no such rule for this word which prescribes feminine suffix. Feminine suffixes are prescribed in which they are found derived from corresponding masculine/neuter gender words.




Hope the rest is clear for you.
