They are two words:

  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*डमरु + अयं \[शिवः\] चण्डताण्डवं चकार, - This Shiva performed the fierce dance, with the डमरु producing sound

डमड्डमड्डमड्डम.

  

Hope the rest is clear for you.

भूः - the surface of पादपीठ, embedded in बहुव्रीहि compound formed of the first half wholly as adjective toचकोरबन्धुशेखरः the main subject of the sentence and the predication जायताम्.

It is called तुक् सन्धिः, and चुत्व सन्धि if you are particular about the sandhi "छे च" prescribe mandatory "t" after a short vowel छ appears augmented to the preceding word. So स्मर+त्+छिद् - now श्चुत्व by the rule "8-4-40*स्तोः श्चुना*श्चुः"



<http://avg-sanskrit.org/kalpeshftp/rd.php?hl=en&query=8-4-40>

which makes स्मरच्+छिद् \> स्मरच्छिद् - accusative singular case ending स्मरच्छिदम्। It is not because of case ending, but the following छ.

  

>

जृभि,*जृभ्*, इ, गात्रविनामे, 1, भ्वादि, 266,prefixed with वि+जृम्भ्+ यु - विज्ञ्रुम्भणा - expansion, streching, spreading.

All the preceding clauses in "dvandva" compound in the locative case or genitive case, meaning between the two objects compounded in each, 
related to समप्रवृत्तिकः in the main predication :समप्रवृतिकः = possessed of equal treatment (between the two) (समं प्रवर्तयन्मनः = possessed of mind equally treating without difference between the two) कदा सदाशिवं भजे ॥ १२॥ = When shall I serve सदाशिव giving equal treatment to the pairs listed.

  

Hope now, if you read the whole verse, the meaning will be be clear. Even then, I am translating once again for clarity:

  

Possessed of equal treatment towards the two:



  

दृषद्विचित्रतल्पयोः = the rock and the beautifully decorated bed;

भुजङ्गमौक्तिकस्रजोः = the serpent and the garland of pearls;

गरिष्ठरत्नलोष्ठयोः = the precious gem and a lump of mud;

सुहृद्विपक्षपक्षयोः = friends and the enemy rivals;

तृष्णारविन्दचक्षुषोः = the grass and the beautiful lotus-eyed (women)

प्रजामहीमहेन्द्रयोः = the common people and the great king of the earth;

\[समप्रवृतिकः (समं प्रवर्तयन्मनः)\]

कदा सदाशिवं भजे = shall I worship सदाशिव?

(without any difference between the pairs listed mutually contrasting each other).

  

Hope this will be helpful answers to your queries.
