This compound can be either a बहुव्रीहि compound qualifying \*ताण्डव (n.) in the neuter gener or a general adverb. In either case, it is in the neuter gender and will not change its form in the nominative singular or accusative singular (when used as adverb) in the neuter gender.



Any clarification needed further, can be provided as and when raised.
