I believe the reason why this shloka is traditionally attributed to gaNapati is not because all the adjectives could refer him, since it can easily be argued for any other god, but because of the 'vighnOpa-shAntayE' praise. gaNapati is given/assigned the vighnAdhipatyam, as per the popular understanding. So it would make sense to do his 'dhyAna' for removing obstacles.  
  
Also, in a sort of reverse logic - I was told by some of my vaishnavite friends that they pray to vishwaksEna for 'vighna nAshana'. So i would think that they don't use this shloka to pray to Vishnu for 'removing obstacles'.
