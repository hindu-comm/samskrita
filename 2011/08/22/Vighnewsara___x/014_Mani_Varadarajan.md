Understanding that this discussion may devolve into a sectarian  
debate, in all probability the "suklAmbaradharam" sloka does not refer  
to Lord Ganapati at all but Vishnu himself in his form as Para  
Vasudeva. For one, the word "vishNu" is present in the sloka, and  
there is no reason why it shouldn't be a "samjnA" pada here.

Para Vasudeva is a "jnAnaprada" mUrti, and as with all such mUrtis  
(Hayagriva, Sarasvati, Dakshinamurthi) he is brilliant white in form  
and garment.
