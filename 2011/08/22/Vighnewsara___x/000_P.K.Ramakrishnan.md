While starting any religious function we start with paying obeisance to



Vighneswara the god who removes obstacles.



The following is the shloka –



शुक्लांबरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजम् /

प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत् सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये //



Meaning – wearing a white cloth, all pervading,

having the glow of moon, four armed, having

a pleasing appearance one should pray for

getting rid of all obstacles.



In this there is no word to mean Vighneswara.



Can someone explain.
