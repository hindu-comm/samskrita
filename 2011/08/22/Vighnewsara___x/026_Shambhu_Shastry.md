Is there ‘vinAyaka’ as a specific devatA in the Vedas? Most likely the PauraNikas coined this name to denote gaurI-suta gaNesha (in his kr\`ta-yuga avatAra, ref. gaNesha PuraNa).



The Rigveda mantras used in gaNapati-related ceremonies/rituals do not have gaNapati (meaning ‘vinAyaka’) as the devatA. In Rigveda 2-23-1 ('gaNAnAMtvA gaNapatigm havAmahE'), devataa is brahmaNaspati, while in Rigveda 10-112-9 (‘ni shu sIda gaNapate’), devataa is indra. The word ‘gaNapati’ appears in the entire Rigveda only in these two mantras. These two mantras plus Rigveda sUktam 8-81 (nine mantras with indra as devatA) plus mantra 10-112-10 (also indra as devatA) are placed together in the gaNapati (or gaNesha) sUktam. It is said that ‘gaNapati is identified with brahmaNaspati or bRRihaspati and sometimes with indra or maghavan, agni and even rudra’. Conversely, it may be argued that indra, maghavan, agni, or rudra is eulogized as gaNapati (the One Lord of all gaNas) in these Riks.



The origin to the dhyAna imagery of gajamukha is possibly from the indra-related Rik sUktam 8-81 (cf. *mahAhastI*). However, there are diverse other opinions. There is also an Upanishad (I saw it in a collection printed in Tamilnadu, don’t recall the name yet; it is not among the 108) that narrates the deeper meanings of vighneshvara, vighnarAja, etc., all attributing to the singular Brahman. The head is the un-manifest and the rest of gaNesha’s body is the manifest universe. Gajamukha’s story is every sadhaka’s spiritual journey, chopping off the “material-only” sensory notion of truth and ‘seeing’ the un-seeable Truth. Atharva Veda’s gaNesha Upanishad also declares gaNapati as the all-pervading Brahman: *tvameva sarvam khalvidam brahmAsi*. It also declares ‘gaNapati’ as devatA for the ‘*aum gam* \| *gaNapatayE namaH* \|’ mantra. In the tradition, this declaration is at least prior to Krishnadvaipayana (Veda Vyasa) time, about 5000 years ago.



Within the Rigveda context, according to Mahesh Yogi ji, devatA is the process or medium of knowledge. “**‪A study of deities of Rig Veda: with the help of science”**‬(by S.S. Gupta, available on Google Books) makes a case that the Rigveda devatAs are the divinities in the pancha tatvas (AkAsha = space, vAyu = motion/r\`ta?, agni = photon that never rests, Apa = primordial substance salila, pRRithivI = material universe). In the panchAyatana pUjA scheme, each devatA is a pancha-tatva divinity - it is said in the tradition that



*AkAshasyAdhipo viShNuH agneshchaiva maheshvarI *\|**

*vAyoH sUryaH kShiterIshaH jIvanasya gaNAdhipaH *\|\|



Further, following the taittirIya Upanishad



*tasmAdvA etasmAdAtmana AkAshassambhUtaH *\| *AkAshAdvAyuH* \|*vayoragniH* \| *agnerApaH* \| *adbhyaH pRRithivI,*



*agnerApaH* would be the same as the gaNapati of the panchAyatana pUjA being maheshvari’s son. We may infer that gaNapati in the panchAyatana pUjA is the sum of all Apa-related devatAs of the Rigveda, and that the panchAyatana pUjA was developed directly out of the Rigveda devatAs, although many of the pUjA details (such as the dhyAna shlokas and the 108 or the 1000 names) flow from the purANas.



An Apa-agni (Apa-gaurI) ‘relationship’ is seen in the chandra mantra (taittirIya samhitA 3-2-5-8 and 4-2-7-12), which is actually for soma devatA with Apa as adhi-devatA (Rigveda 1-23-20) and gaurI as pratyadhi-devatA (as vishve devA in Rigveda 1-164-41 and gaurI in taittirIya AraNyaka 1-9).



Possibly, this gaNapati or gaNesha of the vaidikas became Shiva gaNa’s (bhUtA’s) leader in the Shiva-related purANas. The mantra ‘*aum tatpuruSAya vidmahe vakratuNdAya dhImahi, tanno dantiH prachodayAt*’ (taittirIya AraNyaka 10-1) may well be later to and influenced by the purANa imageries and tantra; eventually, it came into the vaidika usage.



devatA in Rigveda sUktam 1-154 is viSNu (not Sun). ‘ato deva avantu no’ (Rik 1-22-16) has viSNu as deva and Riks 1-22-17 to 1-22-21 (‘idam viSNurvichakrame …. viSNoryatparam padam’) have viSNu as devatA. All these together make up yajurveda's 'viSNu sUktam.'**
