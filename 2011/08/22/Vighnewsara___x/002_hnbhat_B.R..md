Obviously it doesn't refer to Vigneshvara in any way. But mostly it is used by Vaidika-s just because of its mention सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये warrants the memory of विघ्नेश्वर usually prayed explicitly with:

  

गजाननं भूतगणादिसेवितं कपित्थजम्बूफलसारभक्षितम्।

उमासुतं शोकविनाशकारणं नमामि विघ्नेश्वरपादपङ्कजम्॥

  

which is also is not free from flaw at first sight glaringly:

that it is विघ्नेश्वर who is the son of उमा, and not his lotus feet. This also may attract interesting explanation to justify the usage. The more obvious prayer is:

  

वक्रतुण्ड महाकाय कोटिसूर्यसमप्रभ।

अविघ्नं कुरु मे देव सर्वकार्येषु सर्वदा॥

  

which forces to take the above referred श्लोक to this वक्रतुण्ड in one or other way. The belief is important than grammar or lexicon. All are common adjectives in the verse and may apply to any deity, not particularly विघ्नेश्वर as it is used in many occasions. Even विष्णु can be explained as all pervasive and need not refer to विष्णु or नारायण also, whom we can pray for removing obstacles. Rest is left to the opinion of the believers.
