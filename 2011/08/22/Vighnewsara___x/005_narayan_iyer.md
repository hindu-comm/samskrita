I had the same doubt and long time back someone who knew sanskrit (or pretending to know sanskrit) and mantra shastra informed me that the word "prasanna" also means the head/forehead of a young elephant. Is it so? What is the head/forehead or "mastak" of the young elephant called in sanskrit?

  

Regards,
