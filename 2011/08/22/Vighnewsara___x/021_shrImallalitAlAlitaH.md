I can't understand your way of getting meaning of shloka.

What do you mean by 'vedic time' ? Time of their creation by R^iShis ? Traditional people don't accept this. And for those who are not traditional and accept this view, I must say that there is no use of believing gaNesha and propitiating it. They can't prove gaNesha, etc. as real things. They will be imaginary objects and I believe they will accept it easily. So, in their case I leave grammar and everything upon them.
