On the fun side, there is a popular book in telugu from last century called Ganapati (by chilakamarti). The author opens the book describing how this shloka could also be interpreted to pray to a donkey.  
  
1. one who carries White (washed) cloths,  
2. Present every where  
3. whose color is a shade of gray  
4. who has four legs  
5. who has a pleasent face  
  
This is just intended to bring some humor to the readers, I do use this shloka to offer my prayers to gaNapati.
