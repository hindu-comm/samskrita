Please let me know which tradition treats the shloka related to gaNapati ?  
And why ?  
  
Best argument is provided by mani varadarajan above to refute your view.  
It's not good to interpret otherwise if you can get meaning straight. We do that only when we face some conflict with other words of shastra.  
The best way to prove it related to gaNesha is to cite the original contextof shloka and start of book of worship is definitely not it's original context. It is put there because it is useful to destroy vighna of worship.  
  
And   
**Shri H. N. Bhat,

I provided my argument to support the view that viShNu is subject of shloka and not gaNeSha.  
Please see post of Ramakrishna to which I replied.
