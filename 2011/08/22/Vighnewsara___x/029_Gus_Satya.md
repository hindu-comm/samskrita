\>1. Now, people following vedas have a view that vinAyaka, etc. said as bhUta-gaNa are different from vinAyaka,..  
3. Their is another view : even if vinAyaka, etc. are counted as both  
devatA and bhUta, ...  
This created big confusion.  
After reading many posts with little useful information, I came to  
know that talking without proof is useless...

\>3. May be some explicit references would be there in 'gaNapati Adhwara  
shIrSha', but I can't mention off my head.

I'm a believer of Advaita (non duality philosophy), while dvaita and  
viziSTAdvaita are very important steps toward advaita, without which  
it is very difficult to reach advaita realm or consciousness.  
Following is my view as a believer:

Specific name of God such as vinAyaka or gaNapati or gaNesha on having  
particular aspect or task like as a removal of obstacles when we start  
any activities makes us easier to remember God on that occasion and on  
the other occasions with many aspects of God or Truth. The point is we  
should invoke or remember God when we start any activity, better  
still, anytime. With generic name of God or देव, it will be easier to  
forget, this is one argument that sound quite logical to me.

From गणपत्यथर्वशीर्षोपनिषत्:  
.. त्वं ब्रह्मा त्वं विष्णुस्त्वं रुद्रस्त्वमिन्द्रस्त्वमग्निस्त्वं

  
वायुस्त्वं सूर्यस्त्वं चन्द्रमास्त्वं ब्रह्म॒ भूर्भुव॒ स्वरोम॥ ६॥  

you (gaNapati) are brahma, viShnu, rudra, indra, agni, vaayu, suurya,  
candra, brahman...

deva (God) is truth and there is only one. Truth pervades everything,  
it is everything. Brahma is vishnu is shiva, VinAyaka is brahma,  
viShnu, shiva, indra, etc. They called differently according to roles  
they played at certain points or situations.

\>The mantra 'gaNAAMtwA gaNApatigms havAmahE' is written in vedic style but this does not mean it was written in the Vedic period historically, because there is no mention of gaNapati in the Vedas. This deity developed later.  
There are many scholars to-day, who can easily compose mantras in the  
Vedic style, so there were in the past also.

gaNaanaaM tvaa gaNapatiM havaamahe … is indeed in the vedas. It is  
available in R^ig veda 2.23.1
