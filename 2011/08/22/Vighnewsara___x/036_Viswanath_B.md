Hi,  
  
I still think one query remains unanswered. Whats the source of this shloka ?  
  
I was just checking the book from which I was taught the gaNapati puja, and it had this shloka as a vedic mantra. I mean to say that it has the swara symbols.  
  
No, I am not saying that this is a gaNapati shloka because of the book. But I am a bit intrigued by the 'mantra' form of this. Unfortunately I couldn't find the source.  
  
Does somebody know the origin ?  
  
Thanks  
Viswanath
