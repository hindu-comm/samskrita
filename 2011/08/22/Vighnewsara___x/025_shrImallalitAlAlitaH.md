It's OK to disagree with each other. There is no harm.  
I'm trying to express my views and if I hurt any one, please check me.  
But, let be there room to show defects of views of each other. It will help us think deeper and improve.  
I again make it clear that if I show problem with your views don't treat them as personal blemish.
