In the verse gajaanam bhutaganadisevitam etc. the word gajanana itself refers to vighneswara.

There is no other god having the face of elephant.

  

But in the verse I quoted there is no direct indication. 

  

I now remember a meaning offered by my late father who was a sanskrit scholar. According to

him prasanna means a madelephant.  "prasanno mattha vaaraNah". He did not give any referenceto any kosha.
