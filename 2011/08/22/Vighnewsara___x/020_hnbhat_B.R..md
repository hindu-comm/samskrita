Dear madam,

  

I could not digest your above remark. Neither विष्णु nor विनायक is the subject of the verb in this verse. How can विष्णु alone could be expected to be the subject if it refers to him? It prescribes this form to be contemplated for ध्यान to the worshipers. How can nominative sg. can decide whether it refers to विष्णु or not?

  

And in most cases, the Vedic deities bearing similarity of names with the Puranic ones have different attributes generally. More so qualities attributed in addition with legendary feats, but the legends find their origination to the ब्राह्मण portions of Vedic Literature in many cases. There is a saying:

  

"इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदार्थमुपबृंहयेत्।"



often quoted in commentaries.

  

Here is a link to the विष्णुसूक्त in ऋग्वेद:

Here is the possible source for PuraNic depiction of विष्णु as the त्रिविक्रम who measured the three worlds with three feet:

  

अतो देवा अवन्तु नो यतो विष्णुर्विचक्रमे \|  
पर्थिव्याः सप्तधामभिः \|\|  
इदं विष्णुर्वि चक्रमे त्रेधा नि दधे पदम \|  
समूळ्हमस्य पांसुरे \|\|  
त्रीणि पदा वि चक्रमे विष्णुर्गोपा अदाभ्यः \|  
अतो धर्माणि धारयन \|\|  
विष्णोः कर्माणि पश्यत यतो वरतानि पस्पशे \|  
इन्द्रस्य युज्यः सखा \|\|  
तद विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः \|  
दिवीव चक्षुराततम \|\|  
तद विप्रासो विपन्यवो जाग्र्वांसः समिन्धते \|  
विष्णोर्यत परमं पदम \|\|

  

More vivid picture is given by PuraNa-s supported with legends. The etymology given by Yaska is as follows:

  

अथ यद् विषितो भवति, तद् विष्णुर्भवति; विष्णुर्विशतेर्वा व्यश्नोतेर्वा। which is derived by

उणादिसूत्र "विषेः किच्च"(३.३१९) विष्+णु \> विष्णु.

  

He is mostly associated with इन्द्र, and hence in later Puranic period he became as the brother of इन्द्र - as the epithets उपेन्द्र, and इन्द्रावरज signify.

  

Brahmana-s offer curious and strange etymologies of their own based on some legends in them. One of them is the derivation of the word मानुष as given in ऐतरेयब्राह्मण following the episode described of Brahma (of the Purana-s) or प्रजापति chasing after his daughter upwards in the sky and the cause of originating मृगशिराः star. I do not offer the derivation here as it would be out of context and also for decency of presentation in a public forum.

  

With regards
