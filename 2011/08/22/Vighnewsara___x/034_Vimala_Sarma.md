Thanks – all I was saying is that in Rgveda – ViSHnu is considered to be one of the sun deities. The sukta is to ViSNu, of course, but this ViSNu is not the same as the later diety which developed. This is according to Arthur MacDonald “A Vedic Reader for Students”. I don’t have anything more to add to this thread.
