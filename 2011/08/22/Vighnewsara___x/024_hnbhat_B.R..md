You are right Mm. Vedic tradition believes Veda-s are non-human made, not created (at least by human beings) and eternal in their sound form transcending through oral tradition "Shruti" and there is no room for historical accounting or chronology of Vedic Literature and the PurANa-s (all created by Vyasa, who divided the Vedic Literature into four, himself) to elaborate the idea-s in the Vedic Literature. This is the general traditional view generally accepted. Again, even if it accepted, it is ascribed to divine origin as the statements such as declare:

  

"देवीं वाचमजनयन्त देवास्तां विश्वरूपाः पशवो वदन्ति।"

  

and

  

यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति पूर्वम्।

तं ह देवमात्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शरणमहं प्रपद्ये॥

(श्वेताश्वतर ६.१८)



So there is no room for chronology at all.
