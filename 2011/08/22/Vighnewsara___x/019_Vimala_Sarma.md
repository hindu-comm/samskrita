If this refers to ViSNu himself it would be in nom, sg masc, (first vibhakti) as the subject of the sentence and of the verb in pada d, but it in accus, sg masc like the other adjectives.

He who pervades or works.



The question of whether the God ViSNu would be dressed in yellow or white depends on the time in which the sloka was written, whether in Vedic times or later purANic period.

The Vedic ViSNU is very different from the God who developed later, and is a minor deity of the sun.
