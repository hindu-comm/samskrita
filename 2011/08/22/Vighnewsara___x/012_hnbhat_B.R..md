YES. As Shri :Lalitalaalita, suggested:

  

गणेश is described as शुक्लाम्बर, but गणेशसहस्रनाम includes "पीताम्बराय नमः" श्वेताम्बरधराय नमः. and रक्ताम्बराय नमः.

  

Also he is called शार्ङ्गिणे नमः। again the epithet of विष्णु.

  

I have nothing to add. By proximity it attracts the deity as गणेश popularly known as विघ्नविनायक and विष्णु can be a generic adjective endowed with all pervasiveness or omnipresence (as pointed out it can be made to refer to श्रीराम also) विषिनोति - व्याप्नोति - इति विष्णुः - व्यापनशीलः। = all pervading.

  

All the epithets are seen used in respect of all the Gods because of the flexibility of meaning of words in Sanskrit by virtue of etymology. But some have specific prayers for ध्यान as taught by tradition (उपदेश). In a ध्यानश्लोक I remember गणपति is represented as having red clothed and adorned fond of red flowers. Here is the ध्यानश्लोक:

  

रक्तो रक्तांगरागांशुककुसुमयुतस्तुंदिलश्चंद्रमौलिः

नेत्रैर्युक्तस्त्रिभिर्वामनकरचरणो बीजपूरं दधानः \|

हस्ताग्रक्लप्तपाशांकुशरदवरदो नागवक्त्रोखहिभूषो

देवः पद्मासनस्थो भवतु सुखकरो भूतये विघ्नराजः \|\| १७ \|\|

  

Here is one stotra conforming to the above description:

The above makes him black coloured, red clothed against the description having white clothes and yellow (white?) colored शशिवर्णम् .

  

  

This is the state of the above verse neither विष्णु nor गणपति can be conforming to the description strictly. It can be interpreted in both ways. But proximity is towards विघ्नराज.
