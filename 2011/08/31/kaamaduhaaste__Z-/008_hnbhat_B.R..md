As yourself have said, according to Apte both are valid.

  

But in the context, only कामदुघा is valid and has meaning suitable to the context. कामदुहा is valid grammatically, as the instrumental case of कामदुह् - feminine noun ending in "h" हकारान्तः स्त्रीलिङ्ग" meaning by कामदुह्. Nominative will

be कामधुग् आस्ते in this context.

  

Choice is yours.
