Certainly. If a vowel is following, it would be कामधुग् आस्ते।

  

and even if anything is following, isolated also it can be both: कामधुक्, काधुग् - in the nominative singular. But in other case endings, followed by a vowel it would be:

  

कामदुहौ - कामदुहः। कामदुहम्, कामदुहौ, कामदुहः। कामदुहा etc.

कामदुहे, कामदुहः (२), कामदुहोः (२) कामदुहि (loc.sing).

  

  

but when followed with consonants - कामधुग्भ्याम् (३), कामधुग्भिः। कामधुक्षु (loc.. pl.)

  

Hope this is clear. It is not because of Sandhi formation or metrical requirement. Purely based on declension formation. When followed with vowels or consonants it will take the relevant phonetic changes according to the sequence. The word stem ending in the consonant "h".
