This is also quite correct usage as I had explained in my other post among the possible variation in the other verse. I coudn't understand your question in fact. In fact there is not any restriction even if poet makes any minor variation:

  

"अपि माषं मषं कुर्यात् छन्दोभङ्गं न कारयेत्।"



is a popular maxim. I avoided quoting grammatical rules for fear of being too much technical. Here the derivation is कामं दोग्धि or दुग्धे इति कामधुक् - काम+दुह्+क्विप् as per "क्विप् च  । । ३,२.७६ । ।" in nominative singular कामधुग्

  

To Mr.Ramakrishnan's question:

  

And it seems that कामदुहा also may be possible. But not popularly used.
दुग्धे इति दुहा, कामानां दुहा कामदुहा derived as per "इगुपध-ज्ञा-प्री-किरः कः । । ३,१.१३५ । ।" by forming compound between काम and दुहा \> कामदुहा।

But for the popular कामधेनु these two words are popular. This one I could not find in DCS and Monier Williams Dictionary also though grammatically can be derived as above. If one wants to

  

*वाग्धेनुर्दुग्ध*एतं हि रसं यद्बालतृष्णाया।

तेन नास्य समः स स्याद्दुह्यते योगिभिर्हि यः  । । . । ।

तदावेशेन विनाप्याक्रान्त्या हि यो योगिभिर्दुह्यते ।

  

भट्टनायक quoted by Abhinavagupta cited in his Locana on ध्वन्यालोक.

  

Freedom of licence of poet:

  

अपारे काव्यसंसारे कविरेकः प्रजापतिः।

यथास्मै रोचते विश्वं तथेदं परिवर्तते॥
