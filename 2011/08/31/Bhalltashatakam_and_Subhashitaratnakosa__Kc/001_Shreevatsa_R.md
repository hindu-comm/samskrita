Both are available on GRETIL.

  

For the Subhashita-ratna-kosha, see<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/5_subhas/vidsrgpu.htm> and<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/5_subhas/vidsripu.htm> (same text, with possibly slight differences).

For the Bhallata-shataka, see<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/2_kavya/bhall_pu.htm>

  

They are in IAST (Romanised unicode), but you can use a tool like<http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript> to convert them to Devanagari if you want.
