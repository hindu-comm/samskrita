Dear Kolhatkarji,

Re Subhashitaratnakosha, I do not have the facility to open docX documents. I get everything gibberish. Is it possible to convert into a pre docX version- just doc or pdf-and send it?

Incidentally Bhallatasatakam with Sanskrit commentary of Sri Nagaraja Rao is appearing in Sudharma Sanskrit daily.

Regards

Murthy
