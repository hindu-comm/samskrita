I am looking for the Books 1) Bhallatashatakam of Bhallata ( 6th
century Kashmiri poet ??) and 2) Subhashitaratnakosa of Vidayakara ( 6th century Bengali poet??). I have the english translation(by Prof.Ingalls) of the later which is an anthology of Sanskrit verses. I would like to have both the books in Devanagari script.
