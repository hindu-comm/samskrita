A somewhat surprising finding:



<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01112.htm> (Ganguly's translation)



"The son of Surya was before this known by the name of Vasusena.  
But since he cut off his natural armour, he came to be called Karna  
(the cutter or peeler of his own cover).'"

Mahabharata - Adi Parva - 1:104:11, 19, 21 (BORI Cirtical edition)``

 Cannot understand the translation of the last verse (21). Any clues?
