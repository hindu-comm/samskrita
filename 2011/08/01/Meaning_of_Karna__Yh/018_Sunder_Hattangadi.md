Pranams Shri Bhat-ji,



 This research was certainly breath-taking! Thank you.



A few points of note are:



The secret of Karna's being Sun's progeny was known only to Sun, Kunti and Krishna, and was not revealed to him or to the world till the end of the 12 yrs. of Pandavas' exile, when the latter 2 tried to persuadehim to join the Pandavaside, after Krishna's efforts to avert the war failed.



Sun revealed it to him in a dreamto warn him of Indra's approaching him for the ear-rings and armor, and his vulnerabilty in war.



So the name Vaikartana would only be proper after the above episode(mentioned to justify this etymology only).



Radheya was famous for his charity duringhis daily mid-day prayers toSun, when he would give anything asked by a Brahmana. Indra knew this and Arjuna being his 'protege' he enacted that role. The removal ('kartana') of the armor was done at this time, and never before (again mentionedto justify this etymolgy only).

``



During Draupadi-svayamvara, Draupadi disqualified him as a suitor calling him

'sUta-putra' (son of a charioteer), Arjuna -the kShatriya- finally winning the 'contest'. It was then that Karna vowed to kill Arjuna.





Regards,



sunder
