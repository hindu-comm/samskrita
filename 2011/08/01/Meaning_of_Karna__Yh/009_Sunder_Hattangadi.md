The actual episode of Karna giving up his armor and ear-rings to Indra appears to have happened at the end of 12 years of Pandavas' exile, as per Vana Parva, Ch. 298:



<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03298.htm>



"...Vaisampayana said, "As thou askest me, O tiger among kings, I will relate that history unto thee! Do thou listen to my words, O best of the Bharatas! After twelve years (of their exile) had passed away and the thirteenth year had set in, Sakra, ever friendly to the sons of Pandu, resolved to beg of Karna (his ear-rings)....."





So it would be interesting to ascertain if that was the time when Vasushena/Radheya came to be known as 'Karna', and not before then.``
