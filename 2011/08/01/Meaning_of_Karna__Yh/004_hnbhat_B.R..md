It simply says that his earlier name was popularly known as वसुषेण and thereafter the son of the Sun became (known as) कर्ण by this name.

  

Thanks for the source. I was about to look for the source.

  

It has been derived with in two ways:

  

कॄ - विक्षेपे - to pierce, tear - कीर्यते इति कर्णः - with this context, he got his name as he himself tore his chest and ears to give the two things.

  

  

  

कर्ण - आकर्णने - कर्ण्यते इति कर्णः - popularly heard by people, well-known. But the first is fit in this context. Hope the context is clear from the above extract, though it is not complete.

  

The background is there that so far as the built-in कवच and कुण्डल are there in his body, his life cannot be ended. He was felled by Arjuna, in his final battle in which all the unfavorable things against कर्ण coincided at that time. One of them was this. To do favor to his son, देवेन्द्र asked him his कर्णकुण्डल and कवच, in the guise of a Brahmin so that he won't deny. He is popular for his दान and he knowingly parted with his built-in-protection. It was this episode in this extract I hope that gave him his name as कर्ण.

  

  

He got his chariot stuck during the battle, as he himself drove his chariot after his charioteer, शल्य who was somehow convinced to drive chariot for him. (This has another background, due to a curse, he would forget all his weaponry talents learnt from परशुराम in a decisive battle, which was again remedied by the acceptance of शल्य to drive his chariot). So he himself fought driving his own chariot and then got his chariot stuck. While he was lifting, he was hit with arrows fiercely, and felled down.
