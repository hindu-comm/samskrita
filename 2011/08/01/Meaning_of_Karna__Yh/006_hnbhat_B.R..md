Thanks for the information.



But it the quoted portion clearly mentions by this act, he the son of Vikartana, came to be known as कर्ण thereafter,who was earlier known as वसुषेण. as can be seenin the verse. I checked in other editions also.



When this episode took place, there is no clue. I could not findthe episode in the कर्ण parva. May be sometime earlier than that.This is information is available in the अनुक्रमणिका- sub parva of आदिपर्व,but there is no clue when thisepisode took place. But it is clear that he was originallyknown as वसुषेण as the sages named him on his birth to Kunti as clearly mentioned in the episode preceding this accounting for his birth and at the end this episode is mentioned.



14 तम उत्सृष्टं तदा गर्भं राधा भर्ता महायशाः  
 पुत्रत्वे कल्पयाम आस सभार्यः सूतनन्दनः  
15 नामधेयं च चक्राते तस्य बालस्य तावुभौ  
 वसुना सह जातॊ ऽयं वसु षेणॊ भवत्विति॥  

Supports the view that his earlier name given by his foster parents was वसुषेण as given in the quoted portion after the episode. It is the tesimony of Mahabharata itself we have to take in for this supposition.



But when this episode took place, one has to look for it in the completeMahabharata. I have not checked for it and it will be helpful to investigate.



With regards
