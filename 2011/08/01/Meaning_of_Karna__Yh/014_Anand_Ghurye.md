Dear Friends ,  
  
A quick search on the net for the real name of Karna reveals the following  
quote  
From his father (Sun) Vikarattan; from his foster-father's profession: Adhirathi and Suta; from his foster mother Radheya; Angraj from his kingdom; Champadhipa as king of Champa and Kanina meaning bastard.
