भवतः प्रोत्साहनाय धन्यः अस्मि।

  

1\. Volunteer effort is a labor of love, and many of us here carry deep sentiments, an emotional attachment, about saMskRta. In fact, many of us yearn for the day saMskRta is revived as a spoken language, even as we use it whenever possible in our daily life. That is why contributing to sanskrit tools is a natural outlet. Revival of saMksRta may well benefit society at large in many indirect ways.

  

2\. Academic sites may well be accessible to end users, but closed source and restricted data is just that - their not being able to make money out of this does not change this fact. The selfishness inherent in not freeing useful data and code remains.  
  

3\. Machine translation is a very difficult problem. But, many open source software efforts are directed at equally difficult, technically challenging problems (designing new languages, search engines, numerical analysis packages etc..). And it is not like tool-makers cannot learn the simple ideas behind HMM's and read papers. Machine translation will naturally come when much simpler subproblems are conquered.

  

That is not to say that machine translation is the sole problem out there. Let me in fact throw down a gauntlet to those interested:

  

Make a wiktionary bot, a [sa.wiktionary.org](http://sa.wiktionary.org/) and [en.wiktionary.org](http://en.wiktionary.org/) filler.

Purpose: Fill in english-sanskrit and sanksrit-english definitions from various freely available digitized dictionaries.

To quote someone: “Wiktionary is a multilingual, web-based, freely available dictionary, thesaurus and phrase book, designed as the lexical companion to Wikipedia. Lately, it has been recognized as a promising lexical semantic resource for natural language processing applications.”

Subtasks:

-   Parse various dictionaries. -   Use mediawiki [api](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php). Frameworks
    are available in [java](http://jwbf.sourceforge.net/),
    [jwktl](http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/software/jwktl/) and python.
    Better yet, try to get code for one of the bots mentioned
    [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Wiktionary).

Anyone interested in committing regular sincere effort to the above task, please create a mercurial repository for your code in places like bitbucket or google projects and let me know. Otherwise my currently busy self will probably get round to it in due time.
