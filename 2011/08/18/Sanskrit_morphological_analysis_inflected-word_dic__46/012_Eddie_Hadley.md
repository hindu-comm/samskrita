Sai,



 To answer your question.

Exclusive, is a term that implies to the act of limiting.

As for example, presenting a viewpoint as if it were the only one in existence.

It is deemed especially sinful (impure) of the presenter to do so, while knowing otherwise.



Are there not other viewpoints as to the nature of the world, and its occupants, their lives – not to mention the bits reputed to come before and after it?

As for Black. There are dozens of meanings of the term, White, likewise.



To limit meaning to a single one, is to be exclusive. इत्य् अर्थः (Ity arthaḥ - such is the meaning).



And another thing, the displaying of ones colours when going forth into battle (prāya?) while appropriate on battlefield - It is to prevent nasty blue on blue incidents (the being mistakenly killed by your own side), but the waving of ones flag in the faces of men, in the street, is viewed in yet another way – provocative (also sinful).



As to viewpoints in general, here’s another, individual one:

In reality, there are many versions of ‘the Truth’ as there are small (or big) boys in a bit of trouble. Iti Eddie.



Sanskrit and English please, but not Romanised Hungarian Sanskrit - that is impure and should be cast out into the wilderness as being not very helpful to the cause of either those in the red corner or the blue corner.
