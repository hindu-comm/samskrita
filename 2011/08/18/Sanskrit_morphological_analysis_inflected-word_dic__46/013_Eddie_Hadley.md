Vishvas,



\<== Unfortunately I did not comprehend exactly what you are trying to say . . . ==>



I will spell it out to you (and to any other interested party):



Your appear to be soliciting free software utilities for commendable charitable reasons

\- utilities that would attract considerable loyalty payments as licenced apps for mobiles, etc.



 Such information, under the circumstances is a glaring omission from you solicitations.





Simply put, I am suspicious as to your activities, which have been further aroused, having taken a look at the site you are promoting, for free, on this site.

Here are my reasons for being so, perhaps you can allay them?



1. On the surface, your endeavours are indeed most praiseworthy - that of promoting a Spoken Sanskrit Movement.



As again, on the surface, is your new Website - it gives the appearance being a comprehensive study of the current situation regarding Spoken Sanskrit – a commendable effort.



 However, even a cursory click-around on those links, reveals that a large number do not actually exist, therefore giving a mistaken impression of comprehensiveness.



2\. What is most worrying, is the complete omission, of references to the many current, Spoken Sanskrit Movement sites.



 Why? When even a simple Google for ‘Spoken Sanskrit Movement‘ reveals thousands of such references, some having being around for decades - National Radio Broadcasts, even.



3\. As an enthusiast for Spoken Sanskrit, you would know that the employment of capital letters for the vowels E and O, as in your message transliterations – are not the familiar guides to pronunciation.





To me, things do not compute.



You see, I have difficulty in matching your words with deeds - I would have thought that a man of such enthusiasm for the ‘Spoken Sanskrit Movement’ would be best expressing it by making direct contributions to the active movements, or at least, if short of time, by contributing words of encouragement directly to those actively doing so.



My inner organ (manas), which does occasionally get switched on, sees much taking, but no contributing.

Perhaps, you can allay my suspicions that you may simply be soliciting development of free software utilities onto your hard disks – for that’s how it looks to me.

Some people are aware that the loyalties paid to licenced apps for mobiles can be considerable.

namaste shrI-Eddie,  
  
Unfortunately I did not comprehend exactly what you are trying to say in the context of the present conversation. In an abstract sense you did put forth and defined some labels, but I couldn't connect it to the current dialogue.
