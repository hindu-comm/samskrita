Vishva and All,



These issues, do most certainly invade on personal privacy – of all private persons in the big wide world.



The E and the O, are not ITRANS transliteration, by the way, they are IAST transliterations.



 But that is a minor issue . . .



Enabling Java, or any kind of scripting leaves a site wide open to malicious scripts. These are exactly what the Botnet spammers love to find.





Eddie.



 As it happens, I speak from experience regarding ITRANS, as I was a beta tester for [Omkarananda’s](http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/ "http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/") final 2003 version of ITRANS.



I wasn’t a volunteer, they volunteered me – my reward for earlier being a nuisance with my request for Unicode support, I suppose.



Incidentally, ITRANS is no longer actively unsupported - as modern operating having Devanāgarī Unicode support built in, but it is still an extremely useful utility.

Kind Sir, I have nothing to say to you (excepting this paragraph, of course), and I am not interested in allaying 'your' fears, or in defending my use of a variation of ITRANS to accomodate dravidian hrasva e and o, or in proving my 'status' and probity as a servant of the dharma.. If anything, I only request you to cease contributing responses to my postings; I certainly intend to do the same.
