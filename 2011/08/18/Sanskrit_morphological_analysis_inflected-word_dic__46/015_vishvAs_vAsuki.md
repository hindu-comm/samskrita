Kind Sir, I have nothing to say to you(excepting this paragraph, of course), and I am not interested in allaying 'your' fears, or in defending my use of a variation of ITRANS to accomodate dravidian hrasva e and o,or in proving my 'status' and probity as a servant of the dharma. If anything, I only request you to cease contributing responses to my postings; I certainly intend to do the same.
