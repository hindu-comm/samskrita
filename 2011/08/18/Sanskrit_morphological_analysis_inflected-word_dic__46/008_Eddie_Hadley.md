Vishvas,



 May I offer a gentle perspective on the harnessing of natural human resources to satisfy personal ambitions, especially those of an exclusive, rather than inclusive nature.

In this context, especially, you will surely be aware that harnessing of ones own natural human resources is one thing, while the harnessing of natural human resources to satisfy personal ambitions, is another.

The first goes by the name of Yoga, the latter - Ideology.

And there are certain overtones here - I cannot locate the word in the MW, (doctrine is there, aplenty) but from Webster’s:



ideology, n., pl.

 1. the body of doctrine, myth, belief, etc., that guides an individual, social movement, institution, class, or large group.

 2. such a body of doctrine, myth, etc., with reference to some political and social plan, as that of fascism, along with the devices for putting it into operation.

 3. Philos.

 a. the study of the nature and origin of ideas.

 b. a system that derives ideas exclusively from sensation.

 4. theorizing of a visionary or impractical nature.



The practical world may be far from ideal, but it is much more colourful, and much to be preferred by most to the purely black or white ones.



Eddie



 I’ll make an exception, though, for the all white one, known as cricket, which incidentally does occur in the MW.
