The following are the best resources available online that I know.

If you find (or make) anything better, please let me know.

  
1. The Sanskrit Heritage site run by Gérard Huet <http://sanskrit.inria.fr> has a lot of morphological tools:  
\* declension of nouns, conjugation of verbs: <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/grammar.html>  
\* a sandhi tool:<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/sandhi.html>  
\* a"reader" that can parse, segment, etc. phrases: <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/reader.html>  
\[For instance if you're reading the Ramayana and come across the verse "अनया चित्रया वाचा त्रिस्थानव्यञ्जनस्थया /कस्यनाराध्यते चित्तमुद्यतासेररेरपि //" and you are not sure how to read the last part, this amazing tool can help:<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/sktreader?t=KH&st=t&us=f&cp=f&text=cittamudyatAserarerapi&topic=&mode=p> suggests (correctly) that it is cittam + udyata + aseH + areH + api, along with each word's case, etc.\]

  

2\. Then there is<http://sanskritlibrary.org/> (by Peter Scharf etc.) which also has a few tools:<http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/tomcat/sl/Tools>

  

3\. There is Oliver Hellwig's website <http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php> which provides some limited access to results from his Sanskrit Tagger. (Or at least it says so; I haven't been able to figure out how to use the website or what exactly it offers.)

  

Unfortunately, none of these seems to be open-source, but

\* since you also asked for dictionaries, Gerard Huet has generously made available a dictionary/databank of inflected forms under the LGPL for linguistic resources, at<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DATA/XML/>

\* many of their ideas have been published in academic papers, for instance Hellwig's approach is described in this paper among others: <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/Symposium/DOC/Hellwig.pdf>
