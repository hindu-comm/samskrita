Vishvas,

For my own use, I have developed some tools over the past decade or so, whereby I mouse-click on an inflected word e.g. पण्डिताः in a source text and have the part of speech indicated, the stem extracted and automatically displayed in my local version of the MW dictionary.

The source text can be in either or both scripts. (I first ran my conversion program to generate the IAST.)

I have made use of Coulson’s declensions and Huet’s conjugations.

I must add that I have permission from the copyright owners of the MW, and Huet provides free download access for his tables.

The substantive inflections I have taken from Coulson’s book and other sources. So they should be reliable.

These are simple tools, designed to aid translation and interpretation, the grammatical aspects merely a means to that end.

Please see the attached pngs for a better example than this below.

The dictionary is currently having some work done to enable acceptance of ‘fuzzy spelling’ searches.

Eddie
