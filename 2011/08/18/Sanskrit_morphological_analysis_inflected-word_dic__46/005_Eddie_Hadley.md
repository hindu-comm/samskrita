Vishvas,



 The sites mentioned are not corporate, they are academic, and quite accessible. Huet’s in particular I have found invaluable when it comes to resolution of saṃdhi, amongst other matters.



Your enthusiasm is inspiring. Though I would suggest that the skills of the knowledgeable ones be more generously employed for the benefit of the community at large, rather than limited to a tiny minority (relatively speaking) of Sanskrit lovers. Voluntary as they may be, such services could be more widely employed, don’t you think?



The Wiki interface you refer to as an example of what can be done is indeed simple – that’s what interfaces are for. However the technology behind the interface - machine language translation is another matter altogether.



I agree with one of your comments though, re. downloadable version of Huet’s utilities, etc. He demurs on the grounds that it requires a web server, though he remains silent when Apache etc. are mentioned.



Sanskrit to English please, gentlemen!



Eddie



PS

 Sorry about the messy attachments of mine. I have since found a tidier way of attaching files.

I have received 3 enthusiastic/ enthusing responses to my query; and I know that many other saMskRta-priyas are interested in similar endeavours. I will look at the various resources suggested, try to contact the authors for access to code/ technology which we can build upon. **We should seriously create an open source sanskrit NLP project which encompasses various tools and data.**  
  
Because many of us Sanskrit-lovers have both programming skills and some Sanskrit knowledge (if not linguistics/ NLP expertise), there is now great opportunity and will to develop useful Sanskrit tools. For example, I dream of a day when I will be able to read any English webpage in Sanskrit, when the Sanskrit wikipedia will approach the English version the richness of its content. (For an inkling as to what is possible with some very simple technology, see screenshots [here](http://vishvas-vasuki.appspot.com/work/sanskrit/vocabularyBuilder/readme.htm).) But for this to happen, it is important that we are able to rapidly build on each other’ work, without unnecessary duplication of effort. For this reason open source software and freely available data are important.  
  
Of course, non-community based, closed source software and restricted data are very valuable and useful to end users (eg [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de)), but a previous attempt tells me that it can be difficult/ slow to elicit cooperation/ responsiveness.
