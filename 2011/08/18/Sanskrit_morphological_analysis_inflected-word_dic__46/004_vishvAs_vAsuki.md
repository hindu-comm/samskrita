I have received 3 enthusiastic/ enthusing responses to my query; and I know that many other saMskRta-priyas are interested in similar endeavours. I will look at the various resources suggested, try to contact the authors for access to code/ technology which we can build upon. **We should seriously create an open source sanskrit NLP project which encompasses various tools and data.**  
  
Because many of us Sanskrit-lovers have both programming skills and some Sanskrit knowledge (if not linguistics/ NLP expertise), there is now great opportunity and will to develop useful Sanskrit tools. For example, I dream of a day when I will be able to read any English webpage in Sanskrit, when the Sanskrit wikipedia will approach the English version the richness of its content. (For an inkling as to what is possible with some very simple technology, see screenshots [here](http://vishvas-vasuki.appspot.com/work/sanskrit/vocabularyBuilder/readme.htm).) But for this to happen, it is important that we are able to rapidly build on each other’ work, without unnecessary duplication of effort. For this reason open source software and freely available data are important.  
  
Of course, non-community based, closed source software and restricted data are very valuable and useful to end users (eg [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de)), but a previous attempt tells me that it can be difficult/ slow to elicit cooperation/ responsiveness.
