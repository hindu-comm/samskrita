Esteemed friends,  

  

I am looking for the Nirukta in searchable format -- and by that I mean in a searchable electronic format. 

  

I am looking for a specific phrase in it, so as to establish numerical details for the quote.

  

I see it at [archive.org](http://archive.org):

<http://www.archive.org/details/nighantuandniru00sarugoog>

  

...and also at Google Books:

<http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Nighantu_and_the_Nirukta.html?id=0l2UOabkPTIC>

  

...and at Scribd:

<http://www.scribd.com/doc/41840889/Yaska-The-Nighantu-and-the-Nirukta>

  

In all three cases the whole text seems available. But searching in these PDFs, and/or in Scribd, format, for a specific phrase seems impossible as far as I can tell.

  

Thanks in advance for any advice on this,

  

Brian
