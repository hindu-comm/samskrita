Excuse me but I seem not to grasp the reason for renaming this  
thread. The shloka here has nothing to do with the discussion that is  
going on about तितउ, which is likely to be derailed by this irrelevant  
foray. I am changing the topic back to तितउ.

Besides, I submit that bland inane thread titles like 'Help with  
meaning of shloka' do not help at all. A more pointed title will  
probably get more attention.

Now to the query. The full verse in question is

रूपसौरभसमृद्धिसमेतं चम्पकं प्रति ययुर्न मिलिन्दाः।  
कामिनस्तु जगृहुस्तदशेषा ग्राहका हि गुणिनां कति न स्युः॥

Though the champaka flower is blessed with good beauty and fragrance,  
yet the bhramaras are not attracted towards it. Those in love,  
however, to the last person, grasp it. Indeed, how many admirers will  
the virtuous not have?
