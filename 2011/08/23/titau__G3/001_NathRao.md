'तितउ' already occurs in the Rk-saMhita. I am not sure of its  
etymology. I have seen derivations from "tams" also. If you are  
looking for words with a vowel by itself at the end, I don;t know of  
any. But there are words in which two vowels are next to each other.

There is प्रउग, "yoke". It also occurs in Rk-saMhita. It is generally  
supposed to be a prakritic pronunciation of "prayuga". I am not aware  
any others, with the exception of compounds.

In compounds, if the first word ends in "as" and the second begins  
with a vowel other than "a", you will have two vowels next to each  
other without a consonant in between: For example, pura-etR (puras  
+etR) "one who goes in front", "leader", and nama-ukti (namas+ukti)  
"expression of respect" .
