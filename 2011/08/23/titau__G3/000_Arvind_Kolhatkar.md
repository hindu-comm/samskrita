Dear Group,

amarakoSha has the word 'तितउ' in kANDa 2, vaishyavarga. It occurs in  
the line (प्रस्फोटनं शूर्पमस्त्री) चालनी तितउः पुमान्. kShIraswAmi's  
commentary on it reads: चाल्यतेनेति चालनं. कात्यः -  
क्षुद्रच्छेदसमोपेतं चालनं तितउः स्मृतः। तनोति सारं तितउः, तनोतेर्डउः  
सन्वच्च (उ.) (meaning उणादिसूत्र).

I am first of all intrigued by the word 'तितउ'. I have come across it  
for the first time and, as far as I can imagine, it is the only word  
in Sanskrit that has a stand-alone vowel at its end. Normally it  
should join with the preceding vowel 'अ' and form a sandhi but it is  
not so here. Are there any other words exhibiting this curiosity?

While on the subject, I would also request an explanation of what  
कात्य says and of the further grammar explanation.
