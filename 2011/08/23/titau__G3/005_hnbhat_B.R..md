I think the first part of the query is already answered. Thanks for the finding of another similar word.

  

Now remains only the Katya's statement. As I can understand, it simply quotes another lexicon by Katya (which I do not know) to show that the word चालनी is used in neuter gender also, though listed in its feminine form. Grammatically both are possible. The feminine form of चालन in neuter gender would be चालनी. We don't have the part of the quoted line as it appears here. If it also has got "प्रस्फोटनं शूर्पमस्त्रियाम्" the synonyms for शूर्प (or the like) as here, then it would mean (the शूर्प) having small wholes in it (neuter gender) is चालन (neuter gender) and तितउ (is in masculine gender) and in this case it explains what is तितउ also in addition to supplying the usage of it in neuter gender also. This is quoted in शब्दकल्पद्रुम also.



The usage of तितउ is this:

  

सक्तुमिव तितउनापुनन्तो यत्र धीरा मनसा वाचमक्रत ।

अत्रा सखाय: सख्यानि जानते भद्रैषां लक्ष्मीनिर्हिताधिवाचि ।। (ॠ० १०.७१.२).

  

A very beautiful idea of true friendship and prosperity in it with pure minds with perfect speech. The above is quoted in महाभाष्य to show how the correct usage of words are source of prosperity.

  

A सुभाषित quoted in शब्दकल्पद्रुम differentiates the use/function of शूर्प and तितउ beautifully:

  

शूर्पवद् दोषमुत्सृज्य गुणं गृह्णन्ति साधवः।

दोषग्राही गुणत्यागी असाधुस्तितउर्यथा॥

  

The meaning is too clear to need any explanation or translation.



The part relating to the explanation of the etymology is given by Mr. Dhananjaya as I am typing this message very clearly. Just I translate the wordings of the etymology It is derived with the suffix by उणादिसूत्र of शाकटायन "डउ" (note it is not joined in the form of the suffix itself) to the verb तन् = to spread, increase with the meaning: तनोति सारम् - and it acts as the सन् (the desiderative formation suffix to the verbs). The grammatical operations on affixing सन् have been shown clearly how तन् + \[ड्\]अउ becomes तितउ by our friend Dhananjaya and hence I do not repeat it.
