Hello,  
  
I recently came across a Malayalam song and have been absolutely crazy about it. I don't speak Malayalam, and attempts at understanding the lyrics via English have been very unsatisfying. I was wondering if there is anyone on this list who speaks Malayalam and Sanskrit, (or Malayalam and Kannada!) who is interested to chip in with equivalents of the Malayalam words (or at least in identifying the correct forms, like the vibhaktis the nouns are in, and the tense/mood of the verbs). I'd be very grateful for your help!  
  
In case you're wondering, the song is "Kanneer Poovinte" ([original version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rznLiOZUVLo), another [excellent rendition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGUTb6QaGTU)) from the movie Kireedam. Beware, the song's an absolute earworm, and a downer at that :-)  
  
Thanks,  
Mohan
