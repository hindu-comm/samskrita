Namaste,

  

We find that in plays of Kalidasa and other Sanskrit poets some characters speak Prakrit and not Sanskrit (though the translation of their conversation in Sanskrit is given in brackets). Why do some characters speak in Prakrit, is it because they are illiterate? I would also like to know the relevance of retaining the Prakrit portion in the modern editions of these works. Is it required only to retain the originality of the work?  

  

I am asking this question because some of my friends are digitising the plays of Kalidasa in Malayalam (We are typing the complete Sanskrit texts with Malayalam translation taken from books now in open domain. Typing of Vikramorvasiyam, Malavikagnimitram and Sakuntalam is almost complete). Is it necessary to retain Prakrit portion of the conversation? We find it very difficult to do the proof-reading of Prakrit.  

  

I request you all you give your learned opinion on this matter.



regards  
shankara
