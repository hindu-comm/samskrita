Vishva Samskrita Dina Greetings!

  

If one is translating into any language (from Sanskrit), then, the reason for the Prakrit does not exist in the translation. Just as we already have texts with original Sanskrit (with embedded Prakrit) and English Translations (as I am sure exist for many Indian languages).

  

But should it exist in the reprints of today? Yes, the 'original' should be retained with the embedded Prakrit. In all the prints that I have seen (and I have not seen any original), the

'kavi' has laboriously given us the 2-language versions 'prakrit' and Sanskrit for the 'lesser mortals'.

  

Women and other lesser mortals (part of the general public) do read the Sanskrit. The text was not provided to them with Prakrit translations for the elite Sanskrit dialog. And, as Shri Nityanand has observed, the lesser mortals understood the dialogue spoken in Sanskrit. Moreover, I am sure the plays enacted were witnessed by a mixed audience. I doubt that the women had personal translators whispering into their ear about what is going on.

  

If any adaptation needs to be done for modern day, I would think it is in the 'thinking' that those who spoke Prakrit were / are lesser mortals. Again, as Shri Nityanand has observed, we should look at it as a dramatic convention that women, children and people-in-service used Prakrit. Moreover, even the Vidushaka slips into Prakrit on occasion (The Vidushaka's monologue in Shakuntalam, 2nd chapter).

  

--------------------------

  

The above discussion is for 'translation'. If the intent was to use a script other than Devanagari to write the Sanskrit material, then the script being used to write in should device a means of 'transliterating' the Prakrit, too!

  

-------------------------

  

I wonder if modern 'kavi's continue the tradition of embedding Prakrit for those entitled to speaking in Prakrit.

Warm Regards,

  
Vidya
