But as I have noticed, in most cases, the Sanskrit rendering does not necessarily represent the Prakrit text. It might be added by any reader having some knowledge of phonetic changes of Prakrit or picked up from some earlier commentaries which usually give the Sanskrit translation (which textmight have been tothe corresponding to the Prakrit texts they hadbefore them).

There are exceptions to the general rules, as if to say something to secret, one will have to change his language: (this applies to the appropriation of Prakrit language assigned to the characters). But Sanskrit speaking characters do not change their language for this purpose, but only by gesture (कर्णे एवमिव) just act. Prakrit speaking characters, change their language, means they speak in Sanskrit occasionally as in the above case. The reason seems to suppose the others do not know Sanskrit (with which they were conversing togather, but only those characters know Sanskrit who converse secret thing in a code language unknown to others of the group).



As noticed in the earlier post, malayalam characters will have to strive hard to real forms of Prakrit without error, if the objective is to present a error free Prakrit text (which even the editors of Sanskrit Plays too do not mind them, but replace them in many modern editions, the sanskrit translations with the Prakrit text given in the notes). Mostly there won't be correspondence between them, if one knowing Prakrit and Sanskrit happens to have a look at the text in Prakrit and Sanskrit and then to the translation. This is in addition to the readability of the Prakrit text presentable in Malayalam characters. In manuscripts, they use a special convention to economise writing the repeated characters (due to phonetic changes) in South INdian scripts including "grantha" script.
