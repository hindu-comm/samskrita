Bhat Sir,

  

Thank you for your kind reply. You have answered another question I was about to ask - that is whether the Sanskrit translations of Prakirt portion is a later addition.

  

The Malayalam digitisation that we are doing contains both the Sanskrit text and Malayalam translation in Malayalam script. I was just wondering whether we should retain the Prakrit portion or not (at present both Prakrit and Sanskrit texts are completely typed). I wished to know how important it is to retain the Prakrit portion.  

  

Now, after reading your mail, I feel that it is necessary to retain Prakrit text as it is part of the original (where as its Sanskrit translation is not part of the original). I thank all the members who kindly answered my query.



regards  
shankara
