Kolhatkarji,

  

I was not aware of the discussion on Prakrit that took place in Dec 2100. I joined the group later and had not browsed all the earlier discussions. I will read it now.

  

As you said, I have decided to retain the Prakrit conversations as they are part of the original and to give their Sanskrit translation in brackets. There are many books of Kalidasa's plays in Malayalam with Prakrit text, so it is not difficult to render them in Malayalam script. I will just follow what others had done.



regards  
shankara
