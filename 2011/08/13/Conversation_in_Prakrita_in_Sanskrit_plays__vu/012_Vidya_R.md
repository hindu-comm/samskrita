"Briefly, my own view there was that use of Sanskrit in literature,  
statecraft, fields of knowledge, was more indicative as an expression  
of belonging to the elite group, than of the fact that classical  
Sanskrit was a spoken language, which, I think, it never was."

  

With all due respects :

  

Two aspects have got mixed up ->

1\. Sanskrit as a language belonging to the elite, (Who are considered as belonging to the elite?)

2\. Sanskrit as a spoken language (referring to impromptu oral communication between two or more people)

  

If Sanskrit represented in Drama (the dialogue aspects) carries any literary merit, it can only be a reflection of something that had been practiced and perfected prior to getting 'scribe'd.

  

Need for / development of 'saMbodhana-prathamA', 'bhoH', ... must have come out of regular use ... Panini is reported to have observed prevalent usage, and not drafted the rules. And he has a rule for 'abhivAdaye' not being addressable to women and people of lower caste - again, must be observation from what was current ...

  

....

Today, once a person starts speaking in Sanskrit, or, more importantly starts listening to people speak in Sanskrit / deliver lectures in Sanskrit, he / she can have no difficulty in seeing that the language can be (and is) a spoken language, and a thinking language ...
