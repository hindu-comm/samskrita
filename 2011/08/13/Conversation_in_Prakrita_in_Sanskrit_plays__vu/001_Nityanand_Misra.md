Not the characters *per se* but it probably reflects the fact that in Kalidasa's times, the corresponding people in the society spoke Prakrit. For example, in the *Uttararaamacarita*, mother Sita speaks to Ashtavakra in Prakrit. This does not mean mother Sita is illiterate (in fact for the Ramanandis, she is first Guru and the source of many Sarasvatis). More likely, queens in Kalidasa's times spoke in Prakrit, so the plays have this anachronism to reflect the society of the day, if we may. The same characters in Valmiki's Ramayana or Mahabharata speak in Sanskrit, even though Valmiki's Ramayana knows of Prakrit - Hanuman thinks whether he is to speak to mother Sita in Prakrit or Sanskrit in Sundarakandam.  
  
I have seen that in these plays, as a general rule, queens, women (even those in an Ashram), foot soldiers, servants, et cetera speak in Prakrit. The king, commander, Vidushaka, Rishis, Brahmins, speak in Sanskrit. But the two seem to understand each other seamlessly. Toe me this shows the people in the society in Kalidasa's or Bhavabhuti's times who were fluent in Sanskrit (which requires learning grammar over 12 years) included kings, commanders, et cetera. While queens, foot soldiers, et cetera understood Sanskrit but could not speak it fluently hence spoke in Prakrit.
