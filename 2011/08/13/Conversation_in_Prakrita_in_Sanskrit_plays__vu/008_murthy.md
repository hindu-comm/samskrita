I believe neither Sanskrit nor Prakritemployed in playswas a spoken language at the time of Kalidasa or Bhavabhuti. They would have simply followed the convention of making certain categories or classes of people speak Prakrut in plays.

Besides, it seems possible that the same Prakrit text could be recast in Sanskriit in more than one way. As I go through "Setubandham" of Pravarasena, the commentator often gives different interpretations depending on how parkrit is recast in Sanskrit.
