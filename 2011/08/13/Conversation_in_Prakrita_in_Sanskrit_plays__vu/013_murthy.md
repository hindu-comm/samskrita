You are right. Samskrit would have been a spoken language around Panini's time circa 500BC. What percentage of population really used it for day to day speech is hard to guess. Perhaps priestly classes used it. Prakrit including Pali was used by the common folk.

But Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti came at least800-1000 years after Panini, by which time Sanskrit was what Latin was at the time of Newton.Newton wrote his works in Latin although he spoke English.Sanskrit had become a frozen language.
