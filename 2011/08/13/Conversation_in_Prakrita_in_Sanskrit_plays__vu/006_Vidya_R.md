Shri Bhat! Thank you for the note on the authorship of the Sanskrit version of the Prakrit dialogues / verses. I will now have to pay closer attention to Sanskrit version of Prakrit verses before attributing language beauty to the play's author. While the sentiment conveyed is still attributable to him, credit for that language could belong to some anonymous and unsung poet.

  

I should also add that in the same Shaakuntalam (mentioned earlier), there is a verse that Priyamvada speaks directly in Sanskrit Act IV (verse 4), and within parenthesis, it says "saMskRtamAshritya" (resorting to Samskritam), noting the exception.

  

Vidya
