I think the question has been analyzed from different angles answered in detail.

  

I am not going to presume something why Prakrit was used in Sanskrit plays and why certain class of people used it in society of Kalidasa's time or AshvaghoSha-s time.

  

As I know the plays are supposed to represent the contemporary life people of the society as the literature in general is supposed to be. Natyashastra deals with at length on the different languages in different regions and assigns to certain class of characters certain languages (dialects of Prakrit) other than Sanskrit. It might have been laid down the rules to retain closer representation of the contemporary life (including the spoken language) and no other purpose seems to exist to use a hybrid language in a Sanskrit Play.

  

But the Prakrit dialogues are available in manuscripts with or without Sanskrit translation, but Sanskrit translation is not available in all the manuscripts. Hence in scholarly editions, they keep the Prakrit text only and putting the Sanskrit translation to notes or within brackets to show that they are later additions. The Sanskrit translation is added to facilitate the readers to understand the Prakrit text and not part of the original text if we take Natyashastra as an authority on dramaturgy.

  
As Vidya suggested, if the intention is to provide a public, the content of Sanskrit Plays understandable to common people (if many are there) it need not retain the Prakrit dialogues. If it is retained, it should be accompanied with Sanskrit Translation too which would reproduce the edition used for the purpose.

  

For translation purpose, whether it is translated from Sanskrit or Prakrit, it doesn't matter as the object is to convey the idea of the text lines in another language. It may not be necessary to keep the Prakrit text. It is left to the choice of the editor whether to retain the original text of the play in tact or not.
