Dear Group,  
  
I have put together, as far as could, a list of nomenclatures of  
precious and semi-precious stones, collectively known as रत्न or मणि,  
as known to me in Sanskrit literature. I am sure the list can be  
added to and I invite learned members of the group to add more names  
and correct any errors in what is written below.  
  
To start with, अमरकोष gives a few names - but not many - in वैश्यवर्ग  
in काण्ड २. It enumerates emerald, ruby, pearl and coral as precious  
stones, the first two being अश्मजाति. कौटिल्य enumerates the  
following in Book II, Chapter 11 – मौक्तिक, वैदूर्य, इन्द्रनील,  
स्फटिक, वज्र, प्रवालक, each further classified into types and names  
according to colors, quality etc. Pliny mentions in his enumeration  
of Indian stones the following: six varieties of diamonds, coral,  
pearls, beryl, emerald, onyx, amethyst and jasper, besides some others  
like sardonix and socondian. (<http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/>  
upload/Pliny-Indian-Minerals.pdf)  
  
There is no agreement between these early sources as to the types and  
nomenclatures of precious and semiprecious stones.  
  
The following modern dictionaries, available online or in print, may  
be consulted to find out what names they yield of the ratnas:  
  
a) Monier Williams - Sanskrit-English  
b) VS Apte - Sanskrit-English  
c) VS Apte - English-Sanskrit  
d) LR Vaidya - Sanskrit-English  
e) Anundoram Borooah – English-Sanskrit (Vol I - A to Falseness)  
  
I have compiled the following list of English names of stones, with  
their equivalent Sanskrit names, culled from these dictionaries.  
References to them are as (a), (b) etc.  
  
1) Amber – तैलमणि, तृणमणि (e). (b) has तैलमणि as ‘a kind of gem’.  
2) Amethyst – आनील (e). (a,b and d explain आनील as ‘slightly blue’)  
3) Beryl –गोमेद (e). (a, b and d explain गोमेद as a gem from the  
Himalayas and which comes in four colors).  
4) Cat’s eye – वैदूर्य (a,e)  
5) Coral – प्रवाल, विद्रुम (e).  
6) Diamond – वज्र, हीर, हीरक.  
7) Emerald – मरकत (a,b,d)  
8) Garnet – गोमेद (websites)  
9) Jade – अश्वक (c)  
10) Lapis Lazuli – वैदूर्य (b)  
11) Opal – पुलक, विमलक. (c)  
12) Supphire – इन्द्रनील (a)  
13) Topaz – पुष्कराग, पीताश्मन्.  
14) Ruby – कुरुविन्द (b,d,e), माणिक्य (a,b,d). (From कुरुविन्द we get  
the word the modern term ‘Corundum’, which is the name of a class of  
gemstones. I also suspect that the Marathi word करवंद, a dark blue-  
dark red berry that grows in wild profusion in the Sahyadri Hills  
during summer and is sold to train travellers in the ghat between Pune  
and Mumbai, derives from कुरुविन्द.)  
  
It is thus seen that there is fair amount of confusion and  
disagreement among authorities as to the names of gemstones, though  
most of the well-known Sanskrit names are covered in one place or  
another.  
  
What struck me as somewhat unusual is the comparative lack of interest  
among old authorities about diamonds. They are considered today as the  
most valuable and sought-after gemstone. In classical literature  
there is scarcely a mention of diamonds, while मरकत, माणिक्य, प्रवाल  
etc get noticed a lot. For example, अमरकोष does not even mention  
diamonds in its list. Kalidasa’s मेघदूत has many references to other  
gemstones like मरकत, प्रवाल and चन्द्रमणि but not a single one to the  
diamond. Diamond, though known to early India, ranked much lower that  
other stones as a coveted object.  
  
The answer to this puzzled was found when I chanced upon the book ‘A  
Handbook of Precious Stones’ written by Dr. Narayan Iyer of the  
Geological Survey of India in 1947, available digitally at  
<http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_001>  
. Ch. XI of the book is about diamonds and may be seen at  
<http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_073>  
. According to it, while diamonds were known in India from before  
Christ and India was the sole producer of diamonds till the 14th/15th  
centuries, diamond cutting, as practiced in India did not bring out  
the best of a diamond. The Indian skill of using diamond powder to  
cut diamond reached Europe from India in the 15th century and new cuts  
of diamond, discovered by European cutters brought out the diamond’s  
full potential (Ch VII). This explains why, though diamonds were  
known to Indians from ancient times, they were less preferred than  
other types of precious stone. The development of new methods of  
diamond cutting in Europe coincided with discovery of Brazilian  
diamonds and, the Indian production having become exhausted, diamond  
production in India reduced to a trickle. The Brazilian industry was,  
in turn, pushed out by South African and Australian diamond industries  
in later centuries and India has now become a negligible player for  
the production of raw diamonds. (Calling the book ‘Bahadur Handbook’  
is a misunderstanding. The author Dr. Narayan Iyer was a Rao Bahadur  
and that it is a honorific title has escaped the person who created  
the hyperlink.)
