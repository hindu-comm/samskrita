First of came to mind, the usage of word वज्र as cutter wepon/driller as used by Kalidasa:



अथ वा कृतवाग्द्वारे वंशेऽस्मिन्पूर्वसूरिभिः ।

**मणौ** **वज्रसमुत्कीर्णे** सूत्रस्येवास्ति मे गतिः । । १.४ । ।



Or else, my course in depicting this dynasty might as well be easy through the idiomatic gateway already crafted by the earlier poets, like a diamond boreholed by a diamond-edged tool for an easy passage of thread. \[1-4\]

whether we agree it is diamond necklace as translated above with diamonds boreholed by another diamond-edged tool (or diamond itself used for cutting diamonds), it can be said diamond cutting was there at the time of Kalidasa.



There are certain works on Diamond and precious gems called as रत्नशास्त्र-s the date of which could not be ascertained as they didn't attract the attention of the writers of history of Sanskrit Literature. Some titles are listed here:

### 1. Agastīyaratnaparīkṣā, Ratnadīpikā, Rasaratnasamuccaya (probably a chemestry text) २. Ānandakanda - a medical text as it seems to be

having 279 references.

Ratnadīpikā, 1, 22.2  
tathāśubhāni naśyanti **vajraṃ** yasya gṛhe sthitam //

This very interesting referring to melting of Vajra:

Rasaratnasamuccayabodhinī

-   RRSBoṬ zu RRS, 10, 13.2, 1.0  
    **vajradrāvaṇopayogimūṣāmāha** gāreti

Hope this list can be continued. I remember there is one or two works on Ratna-parIkShA too evaluating the gems for commercial purpose.
