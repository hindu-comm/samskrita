Here is a project for a Sanskrit scholar to obtain a Ph.D. He may be called a

Granthi-sphotaka.

  

When Vyasa contemplated to write Mahabharatha

he was in search of a writer. He was wanting to an

epic of several slokas running into laks.



Vyasa contemplated on Brahma who appeared before

him. Vyasa placed before him his problem. Brahma

advised him to invoke Ganesa.



Vyasa invoked Ganesa who appeared before him.

Vyasa asked him to be his lekhaka (Stenographer)

लेखको भारतस्यास्य भव त्वं गणनायक /

Ganesa agreed on one condition.

लिखतो नावतिष्ठेत तथा स्यां लेखको ह्यहम् /

When I write I will not stop writing.

Vyasa agreed but put a counter condition.

अबुध्वा मा लिख क्वचित् /

Do not write anything without understanding

the meaning. Ganesa agreed.

Vyasa started dictating. Whenever Vyasa found

that Ganesa was catching up he would dictate

a knotty sloka. Ordinary slokas are called Grantha

and difficult ones are called Granthy (knotty). The

number of knotty slokas are said to be 8800 out

of a total of 1,00,000 slokas. Ashtau slokasahasrani

ashtau slokasataani cha.

The scholar's project is to locate these granthis from the Mahabharatha

and give their meanings.
