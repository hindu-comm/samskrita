Very Super Title given by P K Ramakrishnan, that no Universities can dare to give:

  

The meaning forsphotaka

-   a boil (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   tumour (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

as given in the dictionary. Vaidyas' definition:

  

### Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā

-   AHS, Utt., 21, 44.1  
    kaphena picchilā pāṇḍurasṛjā**sphoṭakācitā**

(Ashtangahrudaya)



Vaidya-nighanTu:

  

RājNigh, Rogādivarga, 8.2  
visphoṭaḥ**sphoṭakaḥ**sphoṭaḥ *keśaghnas*

  

seems to cause baldness.

  

RSK, 4, 54.1  
sarvaśvitre prajāyante**sphoṭakāścāgnidagdhavat**/

  

This the effect of leprosy according to the third source.

  

Granthi means:

  

a joint of the body (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

  

Now consider the title:
