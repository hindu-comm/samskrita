Namaste,

  

I am thinking of doing MA in Sanskrit (distance education) and I visited their website:<http://www.ksouonline.com/>  
  

Could not find out much from there. No forms available and no admission information. Anyone has taken this path? Do you know any good contact information? I tried to contact one prof. Bhat there and I did not hear back after the first communication. Any help is appreciated.

  

regards
