I had promised a few people here (when I spoke to them over phone!) to collect all the information about the MA Sanskrit KSOU exam....  
But I haven't done that mainly because of the weather here in Bangalore...  
It has become so hard to move out of the houses itself....  
It is raining cats and dogs from last three days...  
Please give me one or two days time, I will collect and post about the same here....  
Dhanyavad
