Namaste:  
I'm not really a scholar on this topic, but perhaps it has something  
to do with our Puranic world cosmology of our earth being supported on  
the back of four elephants, which are standing on a tortoise that  
swims through the cosmic ocean.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akupara#India>

It could also have something to do with 2nd Avatar of Vishnu, Kurma.

But more likely it's a regional custom. I have never seen such a  
thing in temples in Bengal, for example.

aum shanti shanti shantih.  
"The world is like the impression left by the telling of a story." -  
from the Yoga Vāsiṣṭha
