Dear Arvind ,  
  
I am not able to quote any authority or scripture here . This is what I believe it to be .  
  
In temple architecture the tortoise has to be placed below the Bell . So you stand on the back of the tortoise and ring the bell and concentrate on the sound . When the sound becomes weak enough you go to the deity and pay obeisances . When you stand above the tortoise , you symbolise the Prithvi and the bell symbolizes the heavens where you want to reach . A temple in any case is supposed to represent the universe and this fits well in it .  
  
We use similar symbolism in Pooja , Shraddha and in most of our religious functions .  
  
Even in temples whre the tortoise is absent , you will see a diagram on the floor showing ten directions ; this is same as prithvi again .  
  
Also one more thing that you will notice in each temple is the Kirtimukh which is at top of the entrance . You are supposed to pay your respect to it as it shows extreme devotion .  
  
  
Regards ,
