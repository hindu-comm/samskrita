Here is one link to dhwaja-pratiShThA -which has reference to the vAhana of the presiding deity, during the installation ceremonies rites:



<http://enchantingkerala.org/kerala-temples/temple-rites/dhwaja-prathishtha.php>

  
But here it refers to the vAhana on the top of the dhwaja-stambha:



> Besides these, *poojas* are done at the northem-side of *dwaja* on an > *ashta-dala-padma,* and also *adhivaasa-homa*. On the day of > *dwaja-prathishta poojas* are done near the base of the *dwaja,* after > the *usha-pooja* of the main deity. A peculiar rite associated with > *dwaja prathishta* is the taking of the *vaahana* to the *garbha-grha* > and offering of *nivedya* succeeded by *aavaahana* by > *vaahana-manthra* and by special *manthras, vyaapaka* and *nyaasa* > done to flag, bells etc with the accompaniment of musical and > percussion instruments, particularly *paan*i. Then *vaahana* is taken > over to the top of the *dwaja* and *prathishta* done.  

Around or in front of dhwaja-stambha, there are places of structured stones, representing the AshtaDikpalaka-s and the other "pArShada" symbolized by the structure, are worshiped after the pooja ceremonies, daily in large temples. This is according to Keralite tradition. There may be different traditions of Tantra-s arefollowed in different regions.
