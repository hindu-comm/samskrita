I found one reference to this as well

  
Tortoise traditionally is associated with the qualities of protection  
(Mother tortoise protecting its children with its vision).

In Sai Baba's own words "I look after my devotees the way a TORTOISE  
looks after her young ones, never taking my eyes off them".
