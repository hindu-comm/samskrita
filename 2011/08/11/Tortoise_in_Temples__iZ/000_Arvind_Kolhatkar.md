Dear Group,  
  
This a question that I have posed in another Group but have not got a  
satisfying answer to it. May be Sanskrit experts here can do so,  
along with citations of old sources.  
  
Temples, at least those that I have seen in Maharashtra, have a stone  
tortoise just outside the Garbhagriha of the main deity of the  
temple. Why is it there and what does it signify?  
  
Perhaps an old text on Temple Architecture can tell us why. The two  
explanation that I have most commonly heard, though without the  
citation of an authority are a) following Verse 2.58 of the gItA, it  
gives a message to the devotee that he should keep the ShaDripus in  
control, just as the tortoise can draw back his four limbs, head and  
tail under his shell and b) being flat on the ground, the tortoise  
signifies worshifulness and modesty in the presence of the object of  
worship.  
  
I request experts to show light on this question.
