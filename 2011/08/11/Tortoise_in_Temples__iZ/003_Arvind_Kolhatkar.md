The tortoise that I am asking about is not like an Asana, it is a  
stone-carved sculpture that rises above the surrounding flagstone by a  
few inches and , according to some less devotion-minded, is actually a  
space-wasting obstruction in the confined space outside the  
garbagriha. I am not asking about the Nandi.
