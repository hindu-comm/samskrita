I have no answer, for sure.



But I would like to add here that in South Indian Temples, I have not seen such stone image. But in temples dedicated to Shiva, in some temples, I have seen great or small Nandi (a bull) which is related to Shiva as his carrier (in epics) and one of the GaNa-s. In other temples, I have not seen any such images.



The great bull in the Great Temple Temple BrihadIshvara Temple of Tanjore is popular by its size according to the original Linga of Shiva inside proportionately. In others shrines too, it is seen proportionately ofsmall or large size. It is situated inside the "manTapa" before the inner shrine or just before it.





There may be any such relation with the chief diety in the temple. Just guess like others you have given.
