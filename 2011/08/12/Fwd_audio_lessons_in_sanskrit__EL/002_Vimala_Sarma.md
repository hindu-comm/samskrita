I tried playing some of the mp3 files<http://surasa.net/music/samskrta-vani> but they are not clear and do not seem to be targeted at the beginner.

I think you may need something without background noise and said clearly and a slowly.

Try <http://www.speaksanskrit.org/audio.shtml>

And <http://www.navavani.org/index.php>

G S S Murthy’s blog is also an excellent and fun site – maybe someone should add the audio versions to his blogs.
