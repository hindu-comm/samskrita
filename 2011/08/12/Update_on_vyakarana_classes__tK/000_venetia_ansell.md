Hi everyone,

The vyakarana classes in Bangalore taught by Sri Narayana Bhatthave now started. They will happen once a week for the nexteight months, in Malleshwaram, and anyone is welcome to join. We are starting with krdantas and the lessons are taught in Sanskrit.

In addition Srimati Soumya Krishnapur, whom some of you may already know from the Siddhanta Kaumudi classes, will be teaching an online course on karakas and samasas - this is due to start tomorrow. This course has been designed bearing in mind the Mysore Open University Sanskrit MA which many are doing, but is open to all and as it is online, you can attend anywhere provided you have an internet connection. Details are below.

Please contact Sunita, copied here, for the first class, and contact Soumyaji directly for the second class.

Best

Namaste,  
  
I am sorry for the delay in replying to your mail. We were trying to decide upon details regarding the class.  
  
I was talking to Lakshminarasimhan-ji yesterday. He indicated that there are a few of you who have already written the first year exams, and would be appearing for the second year exams this year. So, I guess the ideal thing would be to cover the syllabi of both years. But I'm not sure if we have sufficient time to do that. And it would not be feasible to teach directly for the second year, skipping the first year portions, as I feel the introduction is extremely crucial to make sure you can understand what is said later.  
  
Hence, what I propose is this. We will start the course for MA first year syllabus. (Kaarakaprakaranam and a part of samaasa-prakaranam). I will target to finish the portions in six months (By January 2011). Once that is done, only for people who are taking up second year exams this year, we can have another 2-3 months of classes, and quickly try to cover as much as possible. People who are in first year now need not attend this. They can go for a detailed 2nd year course next year. Please indicate if this would be acceptable to all of you.  
  
If this is ok, we can start classes by August 2nd week. It would be nice to start on 13th August, which is Sanskrit Day. (and also, conveniently, a Saturday).  
  
We will initially have 2 classes per week. Special classes, if required, could be organised on some weekdays or holidays, depending on everybody's convenience. Classes can be on Saturday and Sunday mornings (which is what would be preferable, I was told) - between 6:00 and 7.30. (If people prefer earlier timings in the morning, I'm also ok with that).  
  
Teaching would be online, through a web-conferencing tool. I am looking at the available options, and that will be finalised by mid-next week. The presentations which I use for class, and the audio recordings will be available for download later. There will also be periodic assignments and tests, which I hope will be useful for students.  
  
Medium of Instruction will be Sanskrit as far as possible, and English, wherever another language is required for clarity.  
  
The course-fee for the entire course (tentatively 6 months for the first year syllabus) would be 2500 Rs. (We will try to manage with the online conferencing tools which are available for free. If we need to opt for a paid conferencing option for any reason, the cost might have to be divided among students. I will try to avoid that as far as possible).  
  
If you have any suggestions or modifications regarding these, you can indicate. If you have any questions, please feel free to mail me, or call me at 9731015790. (I might not be able to check mails over the weekend, so it might be better if you call, if you have any queries.)  
  
Regards,
