Namaste Nityanand-mahodaya,

Thank you very muchfor your comments on the dhyanamulam verse. As you say, it looks like 'guroH' works the best from all perspectives - sense, metre and grammar - so I will stick with that.

The other verse continues to confound me. Thank you for noting that pitR etc cannot be sambodhana, but must instead be pratipadika in composition (samasa). Are we then to take 'pitR-mAtR-suhRd-bandhU-vidyA-tirthAni' as one compound? That would leave devatA on its own which seems odd.
When you say guruNAM, do you mean the shasthi bahuvacana - would that not require a dIrgha-ukAra = gurUNAM.

It looks like you, and others on this group, are not familiar with the pitRmAtR...verse which makes it even more intriguing. I wonder where this has come from.

Thank you again and I shall continue to investigate.

Best,

Venetia
