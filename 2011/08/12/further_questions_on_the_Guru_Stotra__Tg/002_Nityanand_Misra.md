My thoughts on the questions on ध्यानमूलं verse  
  
1. It is certainly not guruH - that would not be grammatically correct. There has to be a samaasa or a vibhakti, and the samaasa will make it "guru" instead of "guruH", the vibhakti would inflect guru to a form in one of the singular cases.  
2. Although grammatically "guru" makes sense, prosodically it is most likely not "guru" - the reason is usually the sixth syllable in a shloka is long - श्लोके षष्ठं गुरुं ज्ञेयं. The rule is not universal and there can be exceptions but it is almost universal and it is followed in other verses of the Guru Gita to my information.  
3. Again, though gurau may make sense but guroH makes direct and unambiguous sense. I recite the verse everyday and I say guroH, (gurormUrtiH, etc) as I was taught in childhood.  
4. Yes it is mUrtiH and not mUrti.  
  
On the पितृमातृ verse, the first four words are not sambodhana but prAtipadika for samAsa. Sambodhana form of पितृ is पितः, मातृ is मातः et cetera. It is more likely guruNAM than gurunAma - the latter would violate the prosody of the verse and make nine syllables in the quarter.
