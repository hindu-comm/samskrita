It came as a surprise to me that this version has none of the verses in the long version of Guru Gita.



The short version of Guru Gita has only the following:



#1 corresponding to #67



#2 " #34



#3" #32



#4 " #71



#9"#73



#11 "#74



#12 " #75



#13 "#77

Why don't you try the Gurustotra as commented by Atmananda, which is the shortest and compact version than trying withirreparably damaged versions?

  

I think I had given it in my previous posting which has approximately 14 versions as I had learnt when I was beginning Sanskrit learning. Here is the link again:

Checked again and seems to be free from error and even if typo, they are repairable. If you want to recite daily you can use it.

  

No other comments on these corrupt readings.``
