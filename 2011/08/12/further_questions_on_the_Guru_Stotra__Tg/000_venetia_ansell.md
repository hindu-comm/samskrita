NamaH sarvebhyaH

I have some further questions to add to the discussion on differingversions of the Guru Stotram.

The version I has consists of seven verses, of which five I am able to find in the long version of the Guru Gita. Two further verses I cannot locate and as the version I have has several printing mistakes I am not sure of the correct versions of these two shlokas. The text I have reads:



mantra satyaM pUjA satyaM satyameva niranjanam

gurur vAkyaM sadA satyaM satyameva paraM padam



pitR mAtR suhRd bandhu vidyA tIrthAni devatA

na tulyaM gurunAm shIghraM sparshameva paraM padam



My questions here are:

\- surely 'mantra' should be 'mantram' or possibly 'mantraH' but not 'mantra' unless it is a samasa and if sothen I would assume pUjA-satyaM is also a samasa?

\- in the second shloka, the first four words look like sambodhanas, is this then addressing the guru as 'father', 'mother' etc?

\- should 'gurunAm' be 'gurunAma'

\- I cannot get the sense of 'shIghraM sparshameva paraM padam'



I also have a further question on one verse which is included in the Guru Gita but appears inseveraldifferent versions in different places - the differences seem to mainly be centred on the word 'guru' which can be 'gurau' (saptami), guroH (shasti), guruH (prathama) or even possibly guru (as a samasa) as below:



dhyAnamUlaM gur\* mUrti pujAmUlaM gur\* padam

mantramUlaM gur\* vAkyaM mokSamUlaM gur\* kRpA



My questions here are:

\- Would any of the four options above work in this context - gurau, guroH, guruH or guru? Is any to be preferred and if so for what reasons?

\- My version has mUrti (as above) butsurely it should be mUrtiH?



Thank you very much again for your help with this. I wanted to recite the guru stotram daily for the caturmasya period but realised when I started that the text I had was faulty and so am keen to rectify this as soon as possible.



Best,

Venetia
