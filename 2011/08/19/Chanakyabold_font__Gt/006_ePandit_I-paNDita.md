First you have to extract the text from PDF file. There are many pdf to word/text converters available on internet.

  

Then you have to convert the Chanakya/Walkman-Chanakya font text to Unicode using a converter.

  

Your pdf file contains text in multiple fonts like Chanakya, Walkman-Chanakya901, Walkman-Chanakya905 etc

  

For Chanakya font, use this converter:

For Walkman-Chanakya901, use [this](https://www.box.com/s/86cc4c12d483d8f936ce) and for Walkman-Chanakya905 use [this](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B06JOlm5x83YMDlmYjJjOGItMjdlYy00OTY4LThhZTUtYWZkYTExZGE5MDg4). (Run after downloading HTML files).
