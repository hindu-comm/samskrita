Pushparaj, you have not said anything about size of your file and whether it is a text file, a doc file or some other file. But still, I would suggest you to change its font (encoding) to unicode. You may get a 'font converter' for this job easily. Once it is in unicode, you will have freedom to choose a unicode font, hundreds of which are available.
