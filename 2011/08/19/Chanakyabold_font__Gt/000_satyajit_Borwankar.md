Dear Group,

I came across a document (Ramcharitmanas by Goswami Tulasidas) which has beautiful sanskrit shlokas at the beginning of each chapter.



The document uses chanakyabold font.(I happen to have chanakya font in my pc, but this does not show the characters from this document)



Is this font downloadable? Does one have to pay for this?



I tried the net but was not successful.



I shall be grateful for help in getting this font.



Thanks



Satyajit
