I think your problem is a bit difficult but solvable. It is difficul because it has Sanskrit in legacy text (Walkman Chanakya etc) and English MIXED. Mixing is the main problem here because if you extract text from the pdf file and convert it to Unicode, the english words will also be converted (which should not).  
  
Still there is a way out. This may be this-  
  
(1) Convert the PDF file into DOC file using some PDF to DOC converter (among others, Nitro PDF could be used for this.)  
  
(2) Open the DOC file in MS Office or OpenOffice writer. Select the font (Walkman Chanakya here). Convert the selected font using font conversion macro. This macro has be be written if not available.
