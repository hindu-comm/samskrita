I have 140 pages of Samskrut - Samskrut-English dictionary, typed using a customised software. The pages are saved as JPG and PDF files. Could someone help me convert it into any editable format, so that I can enter the corrections? As it is bilingual, I could not get any help locally. I was told to get it retyped, using Walkman Chanukya. If so, how do I go about it?
