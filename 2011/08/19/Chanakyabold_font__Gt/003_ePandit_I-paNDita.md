Chanakya font can't be typed independently without a software. The tool is 4C Lipika which you have to buy and it is based on old Remington typewriter layout.  
  
There is a free software made by me to type in Chanakya and Krutidev fonts with InScript, the standard keyboard layout of Devanagari. Walkman-Chanakya font support will be added in next version.
