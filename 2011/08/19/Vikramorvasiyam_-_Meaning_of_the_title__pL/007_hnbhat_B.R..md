I had given my analysis in the other thread. In case you have missed, here I am reproducing it.

  

विक्रमश्च ऊर्वशी च - विक्रमोर्वश्यौ, तौ अधिकृत्य कृतो ग्रन्थः - विक्रमोर्वशीयम्।

like किरातार्जुनीयम्।

  

derived from the द्वन्द्वसमास as above as per Paninian rule 4.3.88शिशुक्रन्दयमसभद्वन्द्वेन्द्रजननाऽदिभ्यश् छः

with the suffix छ. विक्रम+ऊर्वशी+छ \>\> विक्रमोर्वशी+ईय (७.१.३) \>\> विक्रमोर्वश्\[ई\]+ईय (६.४.१४८) \>\> विक्रमोर्वशीय \>\> विक्रमोर्वशीयम्।

  

The above suffix fixes the meaning also as "the literary work composed on "Vikrama and Urvashi" as Panini explains the suffix is to be affixed on the "dvanda" compound.

  

Otherwise, विक्रमप्रधाना ऊर्वशी - विक्रमोर्वशी -- or the like तत्पुरुष compound. And it can also be etymologically explained with the above procedure(extension of the above rule). But I don't know how the other meaning Urvashi conquered by Valor - can be got from the above compound than in a round about way and its derivation/etymology according to Paninian system. Any poem or play is a story with a hero and a heroin generally, and it doesn't appear in any way in the title even if Vikrama is considered as meaning valor doesn't necessarily denote the hero. This is my limited knowledge.

  

More explanations can be expected from learned scholars of the group.
