Professor,



 OK.



 No haven't missed your analyses, they were not present on the forum at that time.



Now, I am to understand that the rules have it that in some mysterious way, ‘cha’ gets suffixed to the pair, which in turn, by some even more mysterious ways becomes ‘īya’.



Then I’m on home ground - from there, the two become one - i.e. to express the idea of an aggregate rather than a pair, the neuter singular inflection ‘m’ is applied.



And as to what that aggregate actually is, remains to be confirmed by the actually reading of the work.



Yes indeed.



Many thanks,



 Eddie
