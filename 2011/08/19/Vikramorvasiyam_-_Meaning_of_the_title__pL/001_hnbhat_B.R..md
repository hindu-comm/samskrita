That depends how you take the word "Vikrama" whether the name of the hero or a synonym of valor पराक्रम according to different views of the writers of the history of literature to prove their HYPOTHESIS regarding the date. If you do not accept that the name विक्रम is identical with his patron, विक्रमादित्य, the common patron according to tradition, of the नवरत्न-s including to Kalidasa, it may mean "VikramorvashIya ( UrvashI Won Through

Valor)"in which Vikrama is taken as synonym of valor and accordingly the word is analyzed. Otherwise, if you take it to be the deliberate change of the name of the hero Pururavas, the hero of many legends in the epics, to honor his patron, into विक्रम, this would mean:

  

The story of विक्रम (the hero) and ऊर्वशी (the heroin). Thus, it makes the title to give the meaning, you desired: the story of the hero and the heroin. Grammatical analysis favors this view: विक्रमश्च ऊर्वशी च - विक्रमोर्वश्यौ, तौ अधिकृत्य कृतो ग्रन्थः - विक्रमोर्वशीयम्, like किरातार्जुनीयम्.

  

For the other interpretation, I do not find any satisfactory etymological explanation that can be defended with grammar. Choice is yours.

  

With regards
