Ajit,



Simply put, I was doubly miffed:



1\. The implication is that I had missed the Analyses – through inattention or whatever.

 When in fact they weren’t there to be missed.

 There is the difference between the time of transmission of a message and the time of its visible appearance in a Forum.



2\. Explanations of a Pāṇinian kind are almost completely incomprehensible, to those without years of study, a fact that the good professor, must be well aware of. It must be obvious that I am one of the many, without such years.

Those explanations, to the likes of me, far from clarifying anything, do the exact opposite, they simply add to the confusion.

 Hence my reply in kind, of the deliberately baffling way of saying ‘- they weren’t there to be missed!



Anyway, what matters is that the person who posed the original question, may be none the wiser as to the title, but much wiser in knowing not to ask simple questions in Sanskrit Forums!



Eddie,



PS.

 I feel much better now, for having got that off my chest. (:-)

Hi Eddie,  
I cannot understand your high sounding words and complicated sentences . Its not making any sense to me in short. Writing in a simple language, to the point may be useful for ignorant members like me.  
Thanks  
Ajit
