Vimala,



“No it is not the same as \_tA or –tva which can be equivalent to –ness in some situations.”



Yes, I realize that.



Your post give me to understand the (English) grammatical category, to which ‘-ya’ belongs.

And once I knew that, I was able to look it up for myself.



In addition, the book I used, explained, that there are a further two main sub-categories of these things - those that form an action noun (the doing) from the verb, and those that form the agent noun (the doer).



Sanskritists, will immediately recognize the Sanskrit names used for these sub-categories and need nothing further.

But the likes of myself, where not even the script is native, need a little bit more help. And in their native language, as I cite in the above.



Your generous reply, in my native language, was just the help I needed.



I thank you again,



 Eddie

No it is not the same as \_tA or –tva which can be equivalent to –ness in some situations.

It means – “(story) relating to or belonging to Vikram and UrvAshi”.

Vimla,



Ahh!



 It’s the same sort of thing as –tā and –tva!



These I am familiar with as suffixes used to form abstract nouns giving the sense of ‘state or condition of’

Equivalent to the English –ness. happy –> happiness (complete with a change of semi-vowel y to i).



Now that I have something concrete to go on, I have discovered a whole chapter of these things, in a volume that sits on my bookshelf for years:

Walter Harding Maurer’s ‘The Sanskrit Language’, sub titled ‘An Introductory Grammar and Reader’.



As is the way of these things, they (the prefixes) are disguised under Lesson Thirty-One under the title ‘Primary and Secondary Derivation’, Page 422



Maurer is to be recommended for his clear explanations. He speaks of Pāṇini and the Aṣtādhyāyī, in glowing terms – along with the attribute ‘incomprehensible without commentary. Mercifully, a one who finds even ‘the commentaries’, equally incomprehensible, that’s the last we hear of Pāṇini throughout his 830+ page ‘Introductory’.

As a serious investment, as it’s not exactly cheap, I highly recommend it, even to just a reference a term – as long as you have the magic word to start with.

Now for the magic word for ‘chaḥ’ . .. .



Do make a good recovery.

Best regards,

 Eddie

Dear Eddie

-iya is the same as -ya but comes after certain consonants to make it easier to pronounce, such as nArAyanIyam. This suffix means – relating to.



I am now back home recovering from surgery but will need chemo soon.

Vimala
