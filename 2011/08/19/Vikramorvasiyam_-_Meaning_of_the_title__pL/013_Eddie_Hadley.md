Vimla,



Ahh!



 It’s the same sort of thing as –tā and –tva!



These I am familiar with as suffixes used to form abstract nouns giving the sense of ‘state or condition of’

Equivalent to the English –ness. happy –> happiness (complete with a change of semi-vowel y to i).



Now that I have something concrete to go on, I have discovered a whole chapter of these things, in a volume that sits on my bookshelf for years:

Walter Harding Maurer’s ‘The Sanskrit Language’, sub titled ‘An Introductory Grammar and Reader’.



As is the way of these things, they (the prefixes) are disguised under Lesson Thirty-One under the title ‘Primary and Secondary Derivation’, Page 422



Maurer is to be recommended for his clear explanations. He speaks of Pāṇini and the Aṣtādhyāyī, in glowing terms – along with the attribute ‘incomprehensible without commentary. Mercifully, a one who finds even ‘the commentaries’, equally incomprehensible, that’s the last we hear of Pāṇini throughout his 830+ page ‘Introductory’.

As a serious investment, as it’s not exactly cheap, I highly recommend it, even to just a reference a term – as long as you have the magic word to start with.

Now for the magic word for ‘chaḥ’ . . .



Do make a good recovery.

Best regards,

 Eddie

Dear Eddie

-iya is the same as -ya but comes after certain consonants to make it easier to pronounce, such as nArAyanIyam. This suffix means – relating to.



I am now back home recovering from surgery but will need chemo soon.
