Dr,



*\<== I don't know whether I am a real or false scholar.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/28c642d15a9c640/35D.gif?part=0.1)==>*

 Your are being very modest.

\<== I had given my analysis in the other thread. In case you have missed, here I am reproducing it. ==>



The speed of light is indeed constant, but only in a vacuum. Otherwise its velocity is inversely proportional to the density of the matter through which it has to pass.



Here on Earth, there being a big lump between the places of transmission and the places of reception, the analysis would have been in-flight and probably suffering from a bit of jet-lag and therefore probably wasn’t there to be missed.



Whatever. I’m sure there is a lot of intelligence encoded in the encryption and it is only a matter of time to decode. But even with the small a lump at this end, delays are to be expected.



In the meantime I will be secretly hoping that there is someone out there who has actually read the thing, and can simply report the on the actual contents of the tin, and therefore relieve me of the obligation of entering into technical discussions as to the lettering of the label with the heavyweights. ![Smile](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/28c642d15a9c640/wlEmoticon-smile%5B1%5D.png?part=0.2)





Eddie.
