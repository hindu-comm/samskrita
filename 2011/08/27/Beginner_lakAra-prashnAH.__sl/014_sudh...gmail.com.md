Dear All,

  

I read the interesting discussion on the differentiation between adyatana, anadyatana and parOksha bhoota kAlams.

I agree that the literal meaning of adyatana is 'something that has happenedtoday', and I find that here, as well as in many other commentaries, experts sticking to that literal definition.

My understanding of adyatana is that it is used to refer to the **recency** of the event. The event need not have occurred necessarily today.

  

Similarly parOksha bhoota is used to stress that the event occurred long back. It need not be necessarily more than 100 years.

  

Now, anadyatana is to be used when it is not necessary to stress the recency or antiquity of the event, or when it is not known.

  

Requesting your expert comments in this case.

  

Regards,

Sudhir Varma
