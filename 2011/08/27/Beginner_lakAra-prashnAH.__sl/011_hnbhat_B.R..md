Ask Panini why people didn't use परोक्ष for the thing done by oneself. It can be if you have acted something while you were drunk and do not recall what you have done. People say that you have done some thing, but you do not remember. So people say that I had done rape of some girl. But you do not recall anything. In such cases you can that it was done when I was not aware of it. "मत्तोऽहं किल ताम् आचक्रे". And for similarity of forms, you better ask Panini or the users of the language of that time why did they use such similar forms. For example, रामौ can be used in nominative and accusative forms. You may have to ask Panini why he explained as such?
