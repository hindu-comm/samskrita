It is not one of the 108 Upanishads listed in Muktikopanishad.

Here is a link to information on lthis Allopanishad - as opined by many a pseudo Upanishad probably composed at the period of Akbar:

  

<http://kalyanchandra.in/2009/09/25/allopanishad/>

  

So in this**Allopanishad**, Mohammed is the Rajasulla, whatever that may mean. It can be taken as सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म of which our रसूलल्ला cannot be out of its pervasiveness, if the traditional stream of thought followed.Otherwise, out of 108 Upanishads surviving, one is Allopanishad, written insixteenth century, in praise of Allah. Opinions may differ.अल्ला, अक्का, अम्बा,etc. are all synonyms of mother. So it can be taken as all pervasive nature of the mother Goddess too.

  

But still the fact remains that it replaces the Suprem concept of Hindu philosophy/mythology with अल्ला रसूलल्ला. However it may be interpreted according to one's attitude towards it.

  



  

  

The above image is a short version of Allopanishad found in Artharvanasukta as in Shabdakalpadruma>

  

A pdf is also attached. The Bengali version may be enlarged version of this. Not sure.
