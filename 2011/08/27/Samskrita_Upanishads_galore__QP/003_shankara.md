Namaste,  

  

I have read somewhere that Allopanishad was written by Sanskrit scholars under the instruction of Akbar. Digital Library of India has a Bengali edition of Allopanishad having 740 pages.  
  
[Allopanishad 4990010094907. N. A.. 1907. bengali. RELIGION. THEOLOGY. 740 pgs.](http://202.41.82.144/cgi-bin/DBscripts/allmetainfo.cgi?barcode=4990010094907)

shankara
