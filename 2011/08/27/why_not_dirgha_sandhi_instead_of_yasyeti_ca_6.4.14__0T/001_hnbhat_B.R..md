Dear Advaitajnani,

  

Though you are a beginner, you are familiar with many terms and rules of Sanskrit Grammar. I could not understand your intention. If you are asking the question from a grammatical stand point, please clearly pose your question why your doubt arose. Otherwise, you can ask simply how this form is derived according to Paninian Grammar instead of revolving around some terms you have some how grasped.

  

In the first case, there is no such "दीर्घसन्धि" but popularly known as सवर्णदीर्घसन्धि prescribed by the rule "अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः" which lays down the conditions in which the एकादेश applies. Now coming to your question,

  

'dAkshi + ii  
(feminine pratyaya) to make the final form dAkShii?

  

From where you get this type of derivation, I wonder. It is not all only "Sandhi" rules that Panini has to explain, but a whole network that can explain as far as possible the word forms used in the well grown up language he has to describe.(i.e. not only the spoken form - as in today's applied linguistics). In this net work, the particular form you want to explain comes under the section of suffixes termed as तद्धिताः listed after the rule (४.१.७६**तद्धिताः**). Now coming to your form, I have not found the feminine form दाक्षी, but दक्षस्य अपत्यं स्त्री - दाक्षायणी in the sense of "the daughter of दक्ष". If it is the son, it would be दाक्षिः - and then related term to दाक्षि in feminine would be दाक्षी the one belonging to the generation of दाक्षि would again be दाक्ष \>(4.2.122)  दाक्षी. Only in this periphrastic case the process of derivation can be de justified. In any case, it is derived from either दक्ष or दाक्षand not directly from दाक्षि as you have suggested.

  

I would be obliged how you got this process of derivation and the meaning in which it was intended.

Please give the source for your explanation where you got it.

  

Anyhow, the rule "यस्येति च" was not made for this "sandhi" form only, and it is inter related with the तद्धित suffixes. As it happens, दाक्ष + इ - दाक्षि or any way you derive. I am not detailing the process of derivation as it may be too much wearisome for a beginner. But I cannot understand your question at all. In this case, unless you explain the derivation process in detail. Or you may have to ask Panini, who has made the rule "यस्येति च" to take care of many forms other than दाक्षी. Of course, there are certain short falls in Panini, which were discussed and emended by Patanjali in his महाभाष्य. If your question is based on any of the proposals in the great महाभाष्य I could have entertained it and what you are going to prove with it than finding fault with Panini?
