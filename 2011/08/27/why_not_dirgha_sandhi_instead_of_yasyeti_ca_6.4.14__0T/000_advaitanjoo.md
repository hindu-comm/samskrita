Dear all,  
  
I would appreciate some help to explain why one cannot apply a simple  
dirgha sandhi (instead of 'yasyeti ca) in the example of 'dAkshi + ii  
(feminine pratyaya) to make the final form dAkShii?  
  
I have read that dirgha sandhi cannot apply because it is 'ekAdesha'  
which has antAdivat bhAva but why cannot one opt for an either/or  
situation and take the ekAdesha as 'pUrvasya antavat' OR 'parasya  
adhivat', depending on the situation?  
  
I am a new student of Sanskrit so please forgive me if I'm missing  
something very evident!  
  
Thank you  
  
Anjana
