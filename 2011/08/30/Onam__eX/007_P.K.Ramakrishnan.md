Many thanks to Dr.Bhat for bringing out various points for discussion.
I shall deal only with two

points.

  

Mahabalipuram in Tamilnad.

  

Some one during the British regime did not know the correctderivation of the word Maamallapuram. This place was named after a Raja of that localitycalled Maamalla. Maamalla itself has come from the word
mahaa-malla. A few years ago when I visited that palace I saw a big board giving the nameas Maamallapuram. It has nothing to do with Mahabali.

  

Balipadyama.

  

Balipadyama is the local version of Baliprathama. Most people think this is in honour of

Mahabali. Bali can refer to Mahabali as well as to Balarama. In most of the places in

Karnataka farmers celebrate this day. Balarama is also known as halayudha or halabhrit meaningwho has plough in his hand. The plough is the implement for farmers to till the land. So thisBalipadyama must be in honour of Balarama and not Mahabali.

  

Invite others to contribute.
