Mahabali – Onam – Parasurama kshetram.



According to the widely accepted notion, the ten Aavataras of Vishnu are these –



matsya, kurma, varaha, narasimha, vamana, parasurama, srirama, balarama, srikrishna and kalki (yet to come).



It was during Vamana Avatara king Mahabali gifted his territory to him and went to Patala. There is a place in Kerala called Mavelikkara to be expanded as Mahabali-kara supposed to be the place where Mahabali lived.
Onam is celebratedas the day when King Mahabali visits his kingdom every year.



Kerala is known as Parasuramakshetra. The story is that Parasurama threw his parasu or

axe from Gokarnam which fell near Kanyakumari and the land in between came out of the sea. Parasurama gifted this land to Brahmins to expatiate the sin of killing his mother.



The question posed is this. How can the land which came into existence during Parasurama’s time be the land ruled by Mahabali during an earlier Vamana Avatara?



I request the learned members of this group to offer the reasoning for this contradiction.
