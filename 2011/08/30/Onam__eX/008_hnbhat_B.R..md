tuluvalabaliyendre

  

As I know it is not Balapadya, but Balipadya as I had seen worship as Bali, in Tulunadu. It is called Tulunadabaliyendre. And I do not know any about Balarama being worshiped.

  

You can refer to this page for details of our Tulunadu:

  

<http://hindupad.com/vratas-pujas/bali-padyami-2011-balindra-pooja-during-diwali->

  

than offering your own explanation. It is said Karanataka and Maharashtra also celebrate this festival in respect of Balindra:

We have Pooja rites too, not to Balarama (it is only with Krishnashtrami) in this occasion, but to Bali himself.

  

It is a fact it is farmers festival just like Onam is for Kerala. Nothing more than that related with Balarama through plough. Here is the authentic site for the mantra too:

  

<http://www.sumadhwaseva.com/2009/10/%E0%B2%AC%E0%B2%B2%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%AA%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%A1%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AF%E0%B2%AE%E0%B2%BF-deepavali/>

  

on this occasion. In addition see this blog spot of Hindu celebrations:

  

<http://www.hindu-blog.com/2008/10/bali-pratipada-balipadyami-during.html>

  

If not satisfied from the observations of these from the observers of the festival (of whom myself one used worship in the same way), you can offer your own explanation. Nocon-censusof opinion.
