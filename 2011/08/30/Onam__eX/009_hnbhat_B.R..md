“who, when the vedas were lifted up, when the world was carried, etc........., he made ten forms. Salutations to you, Krishna”.  
On further reflection each bahuvrIhi has the locative absolutive ending –   
  

I can't find any locative in the verse. As far as I can see, all are in dative case, qualifying दशाकृतिकृते (dat. of दशाकृतिकृत् - qualifying in turn) adjective of कृष्णाय.  
  

I don't know how you got your analysis.
