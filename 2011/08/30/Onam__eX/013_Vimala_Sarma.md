वेदानुद्धरते जगन्निवहते भूगोलमुद्बिभ्रते

They are indeed dative endings – present active participles. I thought they were atmanepada at first. So it says – to him who is lifting up the vedas, etc

The locative absolute construction is similar except it is translated as ‘when the world is carried’, but it does not apply here.

This form is described by Whitney 303 b-d.
