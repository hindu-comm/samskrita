The same with Maaveli, as Sankar suggested. If Maaveli could be sanskritized to Mahabali, then Maamallapura can easily be sanskritized
as Mahaabalipura (which is the nearest equivalent.) 

  

About tulunada baliyendra, a book was long ago compiled and published:

  
*Tuluvala Baliyendre.* Compiled by N.A.Sheenappa Hegde,Polali,Sri Devi Prakashana,Parkala,1929/1999



It is in Tulu language, and was republished in 1999. May still be available either in original or translation. I am told that it has been translated into English/Kannada. But no information. Here is the information page:

Strange information like Ravana dahana at Ramanavami festival, at this Bali festival, theyburning the effigy ofVamana:

and even ventured like Maaveli-kara, Beli-gauv बलिगाँव - \>\> Belgam. through Sanskritization.

  

And in Orissa, there is a folk music variety:

  

Of the bewildering variety of folk music of Orissa, mention may be made of Geeta, Balipuja Geeta, but I could not get more information on this.
