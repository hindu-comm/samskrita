I think I am the late comer into the discussion.

  

I would accept both explanations of "Maaveli" differently explained according to the context.

  

In fact, Mahabali ruled the three worlds too. As such, the whole earth was ruled by him. not only Maavelikara especially to get his name. And Mahabalipuram is on the east coast, which can be interpreted as the Capital City of Mahabali, if one wants to present it as such. Relating to place names to Puranic episodes are not particular to Kerala, but whole of India. Just like Paandavapura, and many other names suggest. Many hills are presented as Indrakila, where Arjuna performed penance and fought with Shiva, in the form of a hunter. In my knowledge, one in my place, in Kasaragod dist. which is named as urudur (where Arjuna wrestled with Shiva during the fight) and there is another hill in Andhra pradesh, said to be the place Indrakilaka, where Shiva appeared and fought with Arjuna in the same episode. We have to imagine that they wrestling all along from the eastern coast, they reached western coast (the northern most district of Kerala at present). So Mahabali ruled from Mahabalipuram to Maavelikkara (both fictitiously related with his name) from east coast to west coast if we are to accept the identification.

This tendency is in addition to sanskritizing any name easily to suit the Puranic legends.

  

  

Another strange thing is that while in Southern Part of Kerala Mahabali returns during Onam while at the northern district he is welcomed during Deepavali (for three days). It is a different form of festival, three days he is worshiped during the harvest season. His stay is limited to three days in Tulunadu after spending his vacation stay in Kerala before that. He will reach

for Deepavali, Tulunadu and called Tulanada baliyendre (the Bali in Tulunadu). I don't know the places of his revisit. Is it restricted tour to Parasurama Kshetra or all over India tour? I am not sure.

  

  

More comments are welcome.
