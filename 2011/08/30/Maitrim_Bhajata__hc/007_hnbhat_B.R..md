Here is the correct version.

  

मैत्रीं भजत अखिलहृज्जेत्रीम्

  
आत्मवदेव परानपि पश्यत  

युद्धं त्यजत स्पर्धां त्यजत  

त्यजत परेषु अक्रममाक्रमणम्  
जननी पृथिवी कामदुघास्ते  
जनको देवः सकलदयालुः  
दाम्यत दत्त दयध्वं जनताः  
श्रेयो भूयात् सकलजननाम्।  
maitrīm bhajata akhilahṛjjetrīm  
ātmavadeva parānapi paśyata  
yuddham tyajata spardhāṁ tyajata  
tyajata pareṣu akramamākramaṇam  
jananī pṛthivī kāmadughāste  
janako devaḥ sakaladayāluḥ  
dāmyata datta dayadhvaṁ janatāḥ  
śreyo bhūyāt sakalajananām\|\|  

  

This seems to to be the correct version.

  

The highlighted portion only appears in the reference. 5.2.3 at the end. But the context is different, but the words appear exactly in the same sequence. Here is the link to the relevant text in 2nd Brahmana in Fifth Chapter:

  

tad etad evaiṣᾱ daivī vᾱg anuvadati stanayitnuḥda-da, da, iti,
dᾱmyata, datta, dayadhvam iti. tad etat trayaṁ śikṣet, damam, dᾱnam, dayᾱm iti.

Interestingly it is how the thundering sound da-da-da was understood by Deva, Manushya and Asura (gods, men and demons ) respectively.

  

If you want vedic examples only for justifying the correctness of the form dayadhvam: Here is one from Rigveda.

  

And I came to know that the quotation is cited by TS Eliot in her "Wasteland and the Woolof". I saw some question in a blog spot asking for the meaning of the quotation vis-a-vis in the book. Can anybody confirm this? e-notes.

•vi no raadhaaMsi matibhir dayadhvam # RV.7.37.2d.

But the usage दयध्वम् is correct form in classical usage of the verb and need not resort to Vedic usage. Anyhow, it is a beautiful prayer for world-peace whoever might have composed it.

  

It is cited in many blog-spots with minor differences/typo errors.
