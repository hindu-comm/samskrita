Even if so, you should you use the Sanskrit encoding short only limited to south Indian languages, and some words in North Indian words. You can use long e, o even if by default it is short. I think it is Shreelipi or some other CDAC fonts in which you use both script and language corresponding and change of one would result in the above sequence.
