My apologies to the group for the earlier unreadable emails. I am resending one more time  

in foolproof English. I hope I have correctly transliterated the Samskrita portion into English;

if not, I hope it is still sufficient to convey the meaning. Many thanks.

Namaste,



I am seeking a clarification regarding sentences using the Nijanta construct.  

They seem to appear in two ways. Here’s an example of each:



1.  mAtA odanam bAlakena khaadayati. 2.  vidUShakah sarvAn hAsayati.





This shows that the doer (not the one who causes the action, but the actual doer)  

appears either in trUtIyA or dvitIyA vibhakti. Bhaimee, my guardian angel of the  

grammo-sphere whispers in a footnote that trUtIyA is the default case, but that the sutra  

*gati buddhi pratyavasAnArtha shabda karmAkarmakANAmaNi kartA sa Nau (1.4.52)*  

switches the prayojya (the actual doer, not the causer) to dvitIyA vibhakti in specific cases  

as outlined in the sutra. By this sutra, shouldn’t #1 above say bAlakam? Another sentence  

in my book says ‘shishum kshEram pAyaya’, which agrees with the sutra above.



Then there are other sentences which seem to contradict the sutra such as:



1. svAmI sevakena vastUni AnAyayati

2. chitrakArah sarvAn chitraaNi darshayati



Isn’t the first a ‘gatyarThah’ case?



Based on the second sentence, am I right in concluding that the verb here is a  

‘buddhyarThakah’ case? If so, these definitions based on 1.4.52 seem rather fluid.



And what exactly constitutes ‘shabda karma’ in the sutra?





Bhaimee (in an even lower undertone, in a trailer to his footnote) mentions that

there are some exceptions, but does not elaborate. Can anyone help?!



PS: These sentences are from a Samskrita Bharathi publication. Their books  

are generally well proof-read and quite reliable, so I am assuming there is  

no printing error to provide a happy explanation.



Namo namah,
