namaste,  
  
There are a few vArtikAs after gatibuddhi .. which provide answers.  
  
- AdikhAdyor na - by this vArtika, under Nich, karma saMjnA is denied for atti (Adayati) and khAdati (khAdayati)  
- nIvahyor na - by this, nayati, vahati is explained (and karma under Nich denied).  
  
There are a few more niShedhas.  
  
Some allow karmatva optionally.  
- hRukror anyatarsyAm - harati (hArayati), karoti (kArayati) - in these cases karma is allowed optionally under Nich.  
- dRushescha - similarly for pashyati (darshayati).  
  
For more details, consult your favorite grammar book. The details are nicely explained in the Samskrita Bharati publication "kaarakam".
