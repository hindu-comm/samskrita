Certainly.The authors of**KAs'ikA have got a peculiar habit of throwing VArtikas into SUtras in a number of places .So the variation . Those cited in महाभाष्य are identifiable with the help of a commentary only, intermingled with the comments of महाभाष्य. In many cases, certain वार्तिक-s are embedded into the text of अष्टाध्ययी compiled following काशिका, while the one compiled after महाभाष्य will have certainly a different version of these. If any difference, between the two, only the ones in महाभाष्य are entertained for precise discussion of any point debated. In other cases, the author of Siddhantakaumudi has taken those वार्तिक-s found in काशिका if not opposed to महाभाष्य.**

Yes. There is one आख्यातचन्द्रिका by भट्टमल्ल compiled on the same line of अमरकोश for nouns. Here also it is arranged into semantic classes arranged in a certain order. There are some others also, like धातुरत्नावली, धातुरत्नप्रदीपः of मैत्रेयरक्षित etc. but they are focussed on their conjugation in groups.

  



If needed, I can share a scanned copy of the above आख्यातचन्द्रिका.
