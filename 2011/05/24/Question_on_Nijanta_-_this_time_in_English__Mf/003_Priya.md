Namaste,  
  
Thanks for your response. The Apte link is a fantastic resource, but  
it is  
too bewilderingly long for my purpose. I was trying to find a compact  
formulation that explains the conditions for the 2 different vibhakti  
cases.  
Naresh's comment sent me to the Siddhanta Kaumudi, where there is  
a neat set of vArtikas (almost 10, actually) attached to the 'gati  
buddhi...'  
sutra that are the core of the Apte chapter as well. It is still a  
fairly  
long list of exceptions and counter-exceptions, and it makes sense  
that the Laghu Kaumudi steers well clear of that minefield.  
  
So that's when I realized that my copy of the aShtAdhyAyI doesn't  
list  
any of these vArtikas. It does list various vArtikas all over the  
book, but  
not the ones mentioned above. (My book is a Chowkambha publication,  
the kind that magically falls apart when no-one's looking.) Does  
anyone  
know what the basis is for including only certain vartikas as part of  
the  
aShtAdhyAyI text?  
  
Another question is that the sutra mentions 'pratyavasAnArTha', and  
the  
niShedas include atti, khAdati, bhakShayati, so that leaves bhojayati,  
paayayati, etc. to be expressed in dvitIyA. To figure out how many  
other  
verbs also qualify for dvitIyA, I was wondering if there is a  
thesaurus  
equivalent for verbs, along the lines of amarakoSha which seems  
to focus on nouns alone.  
  
Thanks for the pointers and references. They did help get me out of  
the forest and into the trees!
