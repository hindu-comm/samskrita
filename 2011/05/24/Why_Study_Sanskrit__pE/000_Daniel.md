Namaste gentlemen.  
I take part in a community of Krsna devotees and I was asked to do a  
panflet to publicize a sanskrit course. I thought this would be a good  
place to ask for some advice on what you would include in that panflet  
so people (who already read Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam in  
their native language) feel attracted to this course.
