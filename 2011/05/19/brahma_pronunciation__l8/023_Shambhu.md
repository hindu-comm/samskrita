In “Hindu Dharma” published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (from the  
speeches of Sri Sri Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi MahaSwamiji -  
Kanchi Periyavar), <http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part6/chap5.htm>:  
  
“It is only in Samskrit that the pronunciation is fully phonetic but  
for two exceptions:  
  
One is when there is a visarga before "pa". Visarga more or less has  
the same sound as "ha" - not a full "ha", though. In Tamil Nadu it is  
pronounced fully as "ha" and Northerners who slur over it are made fun  
of. But their pronunciation is correct according to the rules of  
Siksa. With the visarga occurring before it, "pa" becomes "fa".  
  
The second exception: "subrahmanya", "brahma", "vahni" (fire) are  
pronounced as "subramhanya", "bramha" and "vanhi". But all words with  
"ha" coming as a conjunct consonant are not like this as, for example,  
jahvara (deep, inaccessible), jihva (tongue), guhya (secret), and  
Prahlada.”  
  
Thus, as per Mahaswamigal, “prahlAda” pronunciation is phonetic: prah-  
lAda (not “pral-hAda”). The entire book may be worth a careful study  
for Samskrita beginners.  
  
As far as I have heard, the traditional Veda practices in southern  
India follow the above “rules.” I learnt that way and teach that way  
too. Pronunciations we hear in the web or noted by M-W have little  
authority in Veda recitations. Some online pronunciations not just of  
“brahma” but also of numerous Samskrita words are horribly murderous.  
We can't take them seriously.  
  
This issue is different from vakaaara-bakaara regional variations of a  
word itself, or the northerners chopping off (I think it is Persian/  
Urdu/Hindi influence). As already noted in the thread, in Maharashtra,  
the R-kaara is a clear Ru-kaara. The tongue rolls forward the same but  
the lip movements differ. Two learned teachers in a summer school  
there tried hard to change my pronunciation of “mAtR” as “mAtRU”. They  
insisted that I was wrong, but I held on, and still do.

I believe southerners, not withstanding their scholarship, pronounce वह्नि, ब्रह्म incorrectly. Similarly Great Sanskrit scholars from Tamilnad sometimes pronounce Sanskrit words wrongly as they would have learnt Sanskrit in Tamil script. विसर्ग is incorrectly pronounced in South. रामः becomes "raamaha" and गिरिः becomes "girihi", where as it should be pronounced "raamah" and "girih" . Similarly Northerners are prone to wrongly pronounce नाम as "naam" and not "naama", influenced by Hindi.
