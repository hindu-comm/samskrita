I have always heard pronunciation of ब्रह्म as it is written. In chanting all mantras of Sanskrit it is pronounced as ब्रह्म. In IAST Sanskrit texts, it is transliterated as Brahma which is also correct pronunciation.  
  
Even in Sir Monier Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary its transcriptions suggest the pronunciation ब्रह्म.
