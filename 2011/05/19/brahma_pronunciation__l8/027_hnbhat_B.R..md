Thank you Sir for providing more example of the pronunciation of "visarga" as laid down in पाणिनीयशिक्षा posted in my reply, on the authority of conformity other शिक्षा-s too.

  

If the same could be done with the pronunciation :

  

"हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमौरस्यं तं विजानीयात्।"

  

too. I could not reproduce औरस्य ha-kaara. hence it is the only articulatory organ used in the whole list of consonants. excepting the vowels that originate from नाभि for all the vocable according to it.
