There is no difference of opinion. The question was raise due to the writing and its pronunciation unlike the other consonants and vowels which is common for Sanskrit.

  

The question is why it is so and any justification with authority of ShikSha or any other reliable sources. I too know it is the pronunciation in South Indian regional languages which use these two words. Wanted to know the reason for the shift in pronunciation if it is justifies and if not justified with authority, it can be taken as North Indian and South Indian pronunciation of the word in two ways, whereas etymology offers only one sequence. brahma and vahni.
