Can you provide us any rule from शिक्षा or व्याकरणम् or प्रातिसाख्यम् for that.  
Just quoting your father is not enough for those who are themselves scholars.  
I was also taught somewhere to pronounce as you once. And once I was told to do opposite. Now, what could one do in this condition ? So, we need evidence. If you can't provide, .... then .... why should we accept you view at all or of your father's ?
