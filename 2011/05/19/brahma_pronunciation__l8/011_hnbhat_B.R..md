I also knew from my grand father in the same way who used to correct my pronunciation. Vidwan Bannanje Govindacharya, does not supportब्रह्म and वह्नि the two words pronounced as bramha and vanhi in Kannada though it is written as ब्रह्म.  

Some member had long ago raised the question and some other member has bumped it with the reply of DJ Vaidya, another learned member of this forum. I have added my comments too in that thread.

  

Once again recapitulate the discussion, it was solved by quoting the Paniniya Shikshta that the "h" in association with nasal consonants and antaHstha-s semi vowels y, v, l, v is to be pronounced as औरस्य.

कण्ठ्यावहाविचुयशास्तालव्या ओष्ठजावुपू ।

According the above highlighted portion of पाणिनीयशिक्षा, the ह् is pronounced as in the originating place of the voice i.e. उरस्. But in other cases, it is pronounced in the same place कण्ठ like others. There seems to be something wrong in the next lineकण्ठ्यावहौ इचुयशाः

probably should be read as कण्ठ्यौ कुहौ (as कवर्ग considered as gutteral is left out in the list and "h" is repeated in the previous and the next line).

  

Yet we have to take it granted that the pronunciation in uras+ may be practically impossible, as it is a common place of origin for vocables next to नाभि the air for articulation raises up for any vowel "स्वर" now to demonstrate it and a similar pronunciation to something like bramhma. will have to be posed as our respectable Ramakrishnnan has heard from his father and me too from my uncle who differed from me when I pronounced it as "hm" sequence like other conjuncts.

  

And also I am not sure about the answer to be given to Daniel's original question and let him infer the position. If we observe ourselves as we pronounce the sequence, the pronunciation of "h" is suppressed as the whole mouth is closed for pronouncing "m" "n" unlike when "h" is pronounced alone without any vowel or consonant following it. Thats why we may hear it like bramm or like that.

  

Our Dhananjaya Vaidya's reply is there before I post this. Yet I post it for further consultation.

  

With regards
