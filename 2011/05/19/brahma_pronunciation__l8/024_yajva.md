namaste.

On the contrary, there is this pramANa from laghu madhyandina shiksha.  
(<http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/shiksha/madhyandina_shiksha.pdf>)

देवो वः सविता चात्र हकारसदृशो भवेत् ॥१८॥  
देवीस्तिस्रो विसर्गस्तु हिकारसदृशो भवेत् ।  
आखुस्ते पशुरित्यादौ हुकारसदृशो भवेत् ॥१९॥  
विसर्गश्चाग्नेरित्यादौ हेकारसदृशो भवेत् ।  
विसर्गो बाह्वोरित्यादौ होकारसदृशो भवेत् ॥२०॥  
अथ स्वैर्दक्षैरित्यादौ हिकारसदृशो भवेत् ।  
विसर्गो द्यौष्पितेत्यादौ हुकारसदृशो भवेत् ॥२१॥

Also, the siksha makes it clear that functionally, visarga is  
\*distinct\* from ha kAra, implying that the instructions are meant for  
\* pronunciation\* only.  
Hope this serves to increase your reverence towards southerners (sic).

Dr. Ramamurthy Caturvedi in his वैदिकशिक्षास्वरूपविमर्शः (sampurnanad  
samskrt vishvavidyalaya, varanasi, 2003, Rs 360, ISBN 81-7270-112-8)  
notes that this siksha alone, among the many in his study, brings out  
the aspect of pronunciation of visarga-dhvani very clearly & like no  
other; implying the pramANa is a \*rarity\*. It's possible a similar  
pramANa exists for pronunciation of brahma etc; only more research is  
required.

A very imp. aspect to be remembered is, we are referencing  
pronunciation Vedic scholars (as distinct from a janapada) who revered  
vedic learning and preservation more than their lives. Hence the  
numerous prAtishAkhya and siksha works. The acme of this immaculate  
preservation could be seen in the varNakrama pAtha;  
Quote from (<http://www.parankusa.org/intro.html>)  
TTaittireeya varna krama patha, deals with the 26 parameters of each  
Vedic syllable, eight for each vowel, eight for each consonant and ten  
for each accent and is a magnificent record and ultimate guarantee for  
DISTORTION-FREE propagation of Vedic texts in oral tradition. This is  
also the highest level of Vedic scholarship achievable, in  
recitational tradition.  
UnQuote

Trying to explain such a tradition as influence of regional languages  
would be sAhasa.

\> As it has been pointed out earlier by a member of the group, pronunciation of Sanskrit is quite affected by language through which it is learnt. I believe southerners, not withstanding their scholarship, pronounce वह्नि, ब्रह्म incorrectly. Similarly Great Sanskrit scholars from Tamilnad sometimes pronounce Sanskrit words wrongly as they would have learnt Sanskrit in Tamil script. विसर्ग is incorrectly pronounced in South. रामः becomes "raamaha" and गिरिः becomes "girihi", where as it should be pronounced "raamah" and "girih" . Similarly Northerners are prone to wrongly pronounce नाम as "naam" and not "naama", influenced by Hindi.
