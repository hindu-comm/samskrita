Dear Group,

We were taught to pronounce वह्नि as वह्नि and never as वन्हि or  
ब्रह्म as ब्रह्म and never as ब्रम्ह.

As to pronunciation of Sanskrit words being affected through common  
speech, an interesting example is that of the word व्रज. It changes  
from the original व्रज to ब्रज and from there to बृज. The latter is  
spelt in English as Brij and we find it in names like Brij Bhushan  
Kabra, the famous Hindustani instrumentalist of the guitar.
