Dear Murthy,

  

How can you explain the line of पाणिनीयशिक्षा -

  

अयोगवाहा विज्ञेया आश्रयस्थानभागिनः।

  

अयोगवाहौ अनुस्वारविसर्गौ - अत्र विसर्गः आश्रयस्थानभागी विसर्ग इति कोऽर्थः?

विसर्गस्याश्रयः - अः, इः, उः etc. According to me they take the articulation position of the words they are carried/attached to. i.e. a, i. u etc. So considering this, the above pronunciation is correct. How can you judge by yourself, that the pronunciation by Southerners is wrong?

  

And for the North Indian pronunciation also is correct according to the Panini's rule; "अ अ इति" interpreted as substituting संवृत अकारः for the विवृत अ-कार listed in the अक्षरसमाम्नाय like all other vowels. Here too पाणिनीयशिक्षा rules विवृत for all the vowels:

  

स्वराणामूष्मणां चैव विवृतं करणं स्मृतम् ।  
तेभ्योऽपि विवृतावेङौ ताभ्यामैचौ तथैव च ॥२१॥

  

The writer of पाणिनिय़शिक्षा was also aware of the regional variations in pronunciation, but Panini as a pedant considered in conformity to his scheme of description only. Hence none are to blamed as such. This is my humble opinion in the case of brahma also.

  

We don't know how "aurasya" "h" is pronounced, and we are not ready to accept as it seems to be like interchanged "mha" sequence to our ears trained in the usual way. Likewise, the आश्रयस्थान makes the विसर्ग pronunciation similar to ह, हि, हु etc. depending on the place of articulation of the vowel on which it is imposed. My teacher of Grammar had told me that the pronunciation of short अ is correct pronunciation as required by Panini as संवृत अकार and what we consider as correct according to our experience in our regional languages, is wrong.

  

With regards
