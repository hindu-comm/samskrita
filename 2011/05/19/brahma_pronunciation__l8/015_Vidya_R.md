"pANini was most familiar withsaMskRta as spoken in the west of India, and pata\~njali was from thecentral parts. They may have missed specialties of the speech patternsfrom the east or south."  

  

What is the reasoning for absence of short 'e' and 'o' in Samskritam, vs. their presence (at-least) in South Indian languages? (My question does not extend to other non-intersecting vowels / consonants.)
