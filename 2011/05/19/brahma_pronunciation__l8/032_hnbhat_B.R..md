Anyhow I have not hear each had शाखा has its own grammarian, पाणिनि-s व्याकरण is considered as वेदाङ्ग along with the other accessories. Each शाखा differs in its प्रातिशाख्य grammar, which is not applied to Classical Sanskrit Literature as such.

  

If one is interested, a separate discussion can be started on the system and topic of प्रातिशाख्य texts which expects one familiar with all the शाखा-s at the very outset. There is no bar on topic to be discussed in this forum.
