नमस्ते gentleman.  
I am puzzled by the pronunciation of the word ब्रह्म (..the conjunt  
doesn't show properly...)and its related words. I am confused because  
I see that the conjuct consonant ह् + म् is pronounced म् + ह्  
Does it happen in all the cases where that conjunct is used or only in  
the word ब्रह्म?  
Is this an exception to the fact that Sanskrit is pronounced as it is  
written? Is it the only one?  
Thank you very much.

धन्यवदः
