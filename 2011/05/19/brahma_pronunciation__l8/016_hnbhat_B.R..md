I remember there is the reference to long लृ, and short ए ओ in some Vedic शाखा-s but extinct before Panini's time, as recorded in महाभाष्य. Panini has recorded some regional variations of semi-consonants, like व्योर्लघुतरप्रयत्नः शाकटायनस्य, etc. There may be more, but have to be checked. His main concern was with morphology and to some extant semantics. Still no short pronunciation of these vowels are present in any regional Vedic recitations.
