The sequences h+m in ब्रह्मन् - is the etymologically proved sequence derived from the root बृहि  ब्रह्+मन् - ब्रह्मा, ब्राह्मणः, ब्रह्मिष्ठः, etc. almost all the sequences are derived from the same etymology. The same with h+n sequence वह्नि - वहति हव्यं देवार्थम् इति वह्+नि \>\> वह्नि. But with अह्ना, अह्नि पूर्व्चाह्ण, अपराह्ण etc. it is अहन् that taken on denclension अह्ना, अह्नि, अह्न etc.

  

The simplification for pronunciation has lead the metathesis change in the above words, by the influence of the Prakrit words via regional languages.

  

कृष्ण = कन्हय, कन्हा, कण्ण etc. As a rule, the conjunctions with h+ is generally inter-change their order in Prakrit dialects. I don't know about Pratishakhya grammar. But Prakrit facilitates many conjunct letter epenthesis or loss of the initial consonants and in certain words, metathesis is applied like the clusters, h+n, h+l,h+m, etc. 

पूर्वाह्न - पुव्वण्ह, ब्रह्म - \> बम्ह etc.

  

I don't know about Pratishakhya or Vedic recitation requiring this metathesis in the above words but only the influence of regional languages can explain such deviations.
