I agree with Murthy Mahodaya. Sanskrit should be pronounced exactly as it is written (no shortcuts or simplifications).

Re; rAmaha – this is said only because the meter of chants requires the extra short ha. Also for word with --At ending, (pracodayAt) if at the end of a pada, the t is pronounced with a slight vowel attached to it. But of course if you are reading the word, there will not be these extra sounds.
