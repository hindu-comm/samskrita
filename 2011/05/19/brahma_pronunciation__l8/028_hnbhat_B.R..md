Dear Madam,

  

Panini is authority on Grammar only and not on articulation issues. He doesn't mention anything except few remarks. On the issue of pronunciation, the authority is शिक्षा that related to Panini, is called as such पाणिनीय-शिक्षा. Both are accessories to Vedic Literature, independently.

  

शिक्षा, व्याकरणम्, छन्दः , निरुक्तम्, ज्यौतिषम् and कल्पः.

  

which legitimately govern the Vedic articulation and we are discussing within our own limited experiences and feelings within the Classical Sanskrit Literature and some partial knowledge of Paninian Grammar.



I am afraid the discussion should not go on the lines of conservatives of tradition and liberalism in Sanskrit Literature, leading many times, in my past experience, off track of this group. Naresh often pointed out to it, but many do not even mind it.

  

Thanks for all the contributors to this thread and I feel it is time to close this thread.
