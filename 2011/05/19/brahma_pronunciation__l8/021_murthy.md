As it has been pointed out earlier by a member of the group, pronunciation of Sanskrit is quite affected by language through which it is learnt. I believe southerners, not withstanding their scholarship, pronounce वह्नि, ब्रह्म incorrectly. Similarly Great Sanskrit scholars from Tamilnad sometimes pronounce Sanskrit words wrongly as they would have learnt Sanskrit in Tamil script. विसर्ग is incorrectly pronounced in South. रामः becomes "raamaha" and गिरिः becomes "girihi", where as it should be pronounced "raamah" and "girih". Similarly Northerners are prone to wrongly pronounce नाम as "naam" and not "naama", influenced by Hindi.
