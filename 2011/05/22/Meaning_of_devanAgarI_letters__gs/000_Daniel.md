नमस्ते dear group.  
I've heard that each देवनागरी letter has a meaning but I was only able  
to find that of प वर्ग as follows:  
प -- परिश्रम hard work  
फ -- (name?) foam indicating exhaustion  
ब -- बन्ध bondage  
भ -- भय fear  
म -- मृत्यु death

I wasn't even able to find more information online! Where can I find  
further and detailed information on these and the rest of the letters?  
(...if they can be called "letters"...). How is this interpreted?

धन्यवदः

Daniel Tkach
