Some more information about tattva-letter correlation can be found in this book -  
  
Andre Padoux - Vac. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras  
<http://books.google.com/books?id=JqHCEaUMf28C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false>  
  
but I think these meaning are not that symbolic meanings which you search for.  
  
Other very interesting article on this topic is "The Origin of Aryan Speech" by Shri Aurobindu  
  
<http://www.aurovillelanguagelab.org/Research/The%20Origins%20of%20Aryan%20Speech-by%20Sri%20Aurobindo.htm>  
  
With best regards,
