Dear Daniel,

  

Please make others clearly what do you want? Then try to get an answer. A flat question without any specific idea of your research, may bring too many answers from different aspects and perspectives.

  

If you are looking for the "meaning" by semantic standards, referal and the referred, you should be able to get in the Dictinaries. There are many on the net. If you are looking for the scope and nature of each letter, from grammatical point of view, you will get many texts in Grammar answering your question. And, Tantra and Mantra shastra, have their own use and application each of the letters, or VarNa-s in their own terminology and metalanguage.

  

So please specify what you are looking for.
