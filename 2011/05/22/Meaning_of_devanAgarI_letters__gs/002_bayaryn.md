Meanings of most letters can be found by meditating on Sanskrit roots. One can take 5-9 roots which iclude the certan letter and try to find the most general meaning of them - e.g. हा (to leave, abandon) हि (to impel) हु (to offer an oblation) हृ (to take away) हस् (to laugh) हन् (to strike, kill) for ह्. This method works in most cases.  
  
But if the meaning of dhAtu is more general then meaning of all words derived from it, then the meaning of letters will be more general then meaning of roots. So it will be not simple or maybe impossible to express them by words.  
  
There are also systems of correlation of letters and tattvas (in Kashmir Shaivism or Pancharatra) or letters and deities (some tantras). Some consider them as meaning of letters (Devanagari is the City of Gods). From my view this attitude should also lead to the same point (deva and veda are the sides of one).
