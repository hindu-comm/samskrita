For example, many of the technical terms are single lettered in Grammar
in Ashtadhyayi. And the letters of the alphabets described in many शिक्षा-s listed in the context of pronunciation of "brahma" and other conjunct letters on articulation points.

  

Tantra is a vast subject. And every syllable has got its own significance and value in the practice of Tantra and Mantra shasra. As I am not familiar with such works, I cannot offhand suggest any specific text, but in any text Tantra-sara samuccaya, Tantraloka etc. depending on the system Shaiva, Vaishnava, and other Tantric cults they differ. but invariably there one should find मातृका-वर्ण-s called technically present in any text.

  

Depending on which one's investigation is oriented, one can search the relevant texts.
