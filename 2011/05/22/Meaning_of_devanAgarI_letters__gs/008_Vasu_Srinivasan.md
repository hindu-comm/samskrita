While I am not sure where to find the books, this page from the google books lists a few ekaakshara granthas:

  

<http://books.google.com/books?id=hKziSs8Qy44C&pg=PA390&lpg=PA390&dq=ekarthanamamala&source=bl&ots=i2IotR-QVc&sig=yzc8OTjLfiRdei9nv7ZTTNnfVA0&hl=en&ei=vb7bTfmVBKTB0AHA_7DRDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ekarthanamamala&f=false>

  

ekaakshara kosha

ekaakshara maadhava nighantu

  

etc.

  

Sri Apte's dictionary refers to ekAkSharanAma mAla (by Saubhari) for several of its meanings.
