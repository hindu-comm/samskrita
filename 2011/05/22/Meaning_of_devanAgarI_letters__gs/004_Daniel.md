Namaste Mr Arvind.  
I wasn't able to find any more information on MW, not even what I  
posted which I got from a book called Bhagavad Gita Grammar whose  
author I don't remember...  
This is what comes up for "ba" in MW for example:  
  
1 ba 1 the third letter of the labial class (often confounded with %  
{va}).  
2 ba 2 m. = %{varuna} ; %{sindhu} ; %{bhaga} ; %{gandhana} ; %{vapana}  
&c. L.  
  
So I need something else than MW. Any other source you could suggest  
for me to research?  
Thank you.
