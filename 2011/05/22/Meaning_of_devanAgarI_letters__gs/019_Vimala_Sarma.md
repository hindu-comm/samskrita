I am not sure if these sutras answer your question on the meanings of the letters, which I think was answered by Bhat Mahodaya.  
In some of the Vedic texts there mystical sounds such as in bRguvalli TaitIriya Upa such hu for example, but I am not right person to tell you about their meanings, if any. You a traditional Vedic scholar from this group.  
These Shiva sutras are remembered as a shorthand way of remembering the phonetic rules govern the joining of sounds and only used for grammatical purposes.
