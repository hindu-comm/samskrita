Thank you for your reply and interest in helping me Dr Narayana.  
What I meant to ask is about the deep symbolic meaning of the letters  
such as  

प -- परिश्रम hard work  
फ -- (name?) foam indicating exhaustion  
ब -- बन्ध bondage  
भ -- भय fear  
म -- मृत्यु death  
  

For what I've seen one doesn't find such things in a regular  
dictionary or grammar book.  
If my question still does not make much sense, then please excuse me.  
Anyway, your answers so far were helpful and I appreciate them.  
Thank you.
