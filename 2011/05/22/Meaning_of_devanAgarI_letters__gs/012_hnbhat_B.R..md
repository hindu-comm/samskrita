This was what I expected of him. As it seems, they are abbreviations for the words they stand for with the first letter and nothing more than that. I too ask him once again for the source where he found it. Anyhow, there is one school of modern scholars trying to establish the meaning with the way of articulation they are presented vocables. Such thinking I can sense here too, though in certain cases, it may work, as in the case of फ interjection in some languages, phoo! etc. and बन्ध bam dh - the closure of articulated vocables giving rise to the tied position or relation. etc. It is a theory of originate of languages, called onomatopoeic theory trying to prove that the words of language originated by imitating the sounds from nature they heard. Like काक, केका, अन्व्बा etc. It seems to be an extension of the theory with refined vigor with new line of thinking.

  

There are certain definitions too in the line in Sanskrit too, without etymological explanation to support, but only imagination.

  
गुकरस्त्वन्धकारः स्यात् रुकारस्तन्निवर्तकः। (विनाशकृत्)  
अन्धकारविनाशत्वात् गुरुरित्यभिधीयते ।।..

  

and many definitions rather than etymology are found in पुराण-s. One of the definitions of कृष्ण with a different meaning for each letter is also found, than, कृष्+ण - which is derived denoting black color grammatically. "कृष्णो वर्णे" extended to literal meaning of the verb: "कर्षणात् कृष्णो रमणाद् रामो व्यापनाद् विष्णुः" इति। The Puranic explanation goes further,

  

कृषिर्भूवाचकः शब्दो णश्च निर्वृतिवाचकः।

तयोरैक्यात् परं ब्रह्म कृष्ण इत्यभिधीयते॥

  

which follows:

  

कृषिर्भूवाचकः शब्दो णश्च निर्वृतिवाचकः।

कृष्णस्तद्भावयोगाच्च कृष्णो भवति सात्वतः॥

  

(महाभारतम्).

  
As many एकाक्षर-कोश-s are available, all of them would help in this direction. Two of them एकाक्षरकोश of Purushottamadeva and one more was given link in some of the threads by me and Dhaval. Here a link is given in previous post to many of such works.
