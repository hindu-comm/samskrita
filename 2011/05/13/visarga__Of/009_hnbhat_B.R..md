Even if Sh(iva) is there, it would become namaH shivAya. See the optional forms in the examplesवृक्षः शेते, वृक्षश्शेते। Both are examples of the same Sandhi formed under the above quoted rule. It is not so for other consonants. In sandhi, they will take o in other cases as you have noted.

  

As isolated visarga in the case ending, without the Sandhi, it need not be quoted in the example. Otherwise, sh + sh will be the obligatory form in the sequence, in the sandhi. It may be oversimplification, but our Daniel asked for "visargasandhi" rule for that form, I think.

  

All sandhi-s are optional in a prose, but only in verse paadas they are obligatory. This is different from optional forms allowed by the sandhi-formation rules, as "vA" in the present rule. Otherwise, it is optional following the general maxim for sandhi formation:

  

संहितैकपदेनित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः.\|

नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥

The second half is variable with this one too:  

सूत्रेष्वपि तथा नित्या सैवान्यत्र विभाषया\|\|

  

Our friend SL Abhyankar has beautifully explained the above verse in his New Approach Sanskrit Lessons:

In this case of visarga+ s(+th) it will take optionally 3 more forms:

  

वृक्षा स्थातारः, वृक्षाः स्थातारः, वृक्षास्स्थातारः।

  

Just more information provided.
