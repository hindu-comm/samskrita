Dear Daniel,

If you want to check how adjacent words get joined in Sanskrit, you may have a look at

<http://chitrakavyaa.appspot.com/sandhi.html>

where my Sandhi-joiner Java program is embedded in a google app. Please closely follow the transliteration scheme given there for inputting words.

If you know how to launch a java program and have Java on your machine I can send you bare Java program directly over Email., which is a shade better than the embedded one.

Regards

Murthy
