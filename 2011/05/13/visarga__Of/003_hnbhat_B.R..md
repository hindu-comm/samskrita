It is the same rule for visargasandhi raamaH karoti,

  

रामः करोति रामो गच्छति\|

rāmaḥ karoti rāmo gacchati

  

The difference depends on the following consonant/vowel effecting the prescribed changes subsequent to the changes effected to the visarga in inflected form of the word. Some take fixed forms and some others two or more alternative forms.

  

Since I am no sure how many rules of visargasandhi you are familiar with and how many you have not covered, I am not in a position to elaborate or expose all the rules here.

  

Anyhow, in the above sequence, it takes two alternative forms

  

रामः शेते रामश्शेते - the visaraga before the consonantsश्, ष्, स्.

optionally. Here is a page relating with "visargasandhi" in a simplified language without using any technical terms:

  

<http://www.ubcsanskrit.ca/lesson3/sandhirules.html#visarga>

  

  

  

The above page allows to read the words either in Devanagari script or IAST script optionally.

  

Hope this will help you to eliminate any doubts in this regard. If you are referring to any specific rule of Panini, you can refer to by the numbers in Ashtadhyayi, provided you can understand from the text or its English translation.

  

With regards
