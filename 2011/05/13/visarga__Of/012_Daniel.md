Thank you very much all of you for your detailed answers. I had  
studied all (I think) sandhi rules long time ago, now that I'm  
inspired to start again I don't dare to ask simple questions, you are  
very kind.  
Yes, I wanted to know mainly about pronunciation, now I know I have  
two choices.  
The websites you referred me to are bookmarked now, very interesting  
and useful.  
धन्यवदः  
  
Daniel
