The Manusmr\`ti verse seems to be as:  
  
ApO nArA iti prOktApO vai narasUnavaH  
tA yadasyAyanaM pUrvaM tEna nArayaNaH smr\`taH  
  
M-W or [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) has a list for nAra along these lines:  
  
Spiritual, human, mortal, relating to or proceeding from men, water,  
man, calf, multitude of men, dry ginger, the primeval Man or eternal  
Spirit pervading the universe (always associated with nArAyaNa), son  
of the primeval man.  
  
None of these meanings has much bearing with the definition in  
Manusmr\`ti or the context where it appears (the process of universal  
creation - AsIdidaM tamOBhUtaM aprajnAtaM alakShaNaM, etc. before all  
this sprang up – verse 1.5 onwards). This nArA is also salila, Apa,  
samudra, etc. of the Vedas (salilagM sarvamA idam - nAsadIya sUktam;  
Apam ApAm ApaH sarvAH – yajurAraNyaka aruNa prashna beginning).  
  
From the context in the Manusmr\`ti, this “nArA” is the very first  
entity in the creation. Therefore we may say that it refers to the  
primordial indistinguishable substance in the creation, kind of the  
singular fundamental particle hypothesized in modern quantum physics  
from which all the other 200 or so fundamental particles and this  
universe were formed. It is not water but it is in the water or in any  
matter or even in AkAsha. That was all there first, then He entered  
it; therefore He is nArAyaNa.  
  
He is the same as the puruSha of the puruSha sUktam wherein also a  
similar account of the creation is given. He is the paramaH (sa brahma  
sa shivaH sa hariH sa indraH sa akSharaH) in His own rAShtram  
(svarAt), claims shruti.
