In महाभारत you can find many such verses found in other works. May be many more you can find between this and other smRti-s traceable to Mahabharata.

  

"यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित्।"

  

is a popular saying for the comprehensive topics taken up in महाभारत though a ballad account of conflict between royal families of Kuru and Pandava-s as the name जय suggests. and culminated in महाभारत.
