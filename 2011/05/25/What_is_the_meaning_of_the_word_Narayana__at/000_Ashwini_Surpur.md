Namaste,

  

For the meaning of theword"Narayana", I found two sources below.

  

One in Manu Smriti and the other in Mahabharata I suppose. But almost similar shlokas? Please comment.

  

[Manu Smriti 1.10:](http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110319233956AAWYW4t)  
'apo narah iti proktah apo vai narasunavah \|  
ta yadasyayanam purvam tasman narayanah smrtah \|\|'  
  
The waters are called narah, (for) the waters are, indeed, the offspring of Nara; as they were his first residence (ayana), he thence is named Narayana.

  

2.<http://www.mahabharata-resources.org/harivamsa/hv_1_1.html>

  
Apo nArA iti proktA Apo vai nara-sUnavaH\|  
ayanaM tasya tAH pUrvaM tena nArAyaNaH smR^itaH \|\|1-1-28  
  
Waters are called 'nAraâ€™, because thy are the fundamental principle emerged from nArAyaNa, from which the living-beings have also emerged,nArA iti asya vyAkhyAnam -nara sUnavaH iti; and because the almighty has firstly entered waters, he is known asnArAyaNa, i.e.,nAra= waters; nArAyaNasya= of nArAyaNa;ayanam= pravesha sthAnam -entry point, abode.  
  
regards,

Ashwini
