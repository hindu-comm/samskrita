Dear Group,  
  
The extract from Swami VivekAnanda in the previous posting seem to  
suggest that it was AdiShankarAchArya, who took out the 700 and odd  
verses, otherwise submerged in the BhIShmaparva, and brought them into  
prominence as a separate text called BhagavadgItA. If this is indeed  
so, that is, if the GitA as a philosophical text was unrecognized  
prior to AdiShankarAchArya noticing it and writing a commentary upon  
it, it would make the AchArya its ‘author’, so to speak.  
  
I do not have enough learning to say how the gItA text was looked upon  
prior to AchArya. Are any commentaries or anything else available  
from pre-8th century to suggest that gItA, by itself, was considered a  
significant philosophical text pre-8th century?  
  
I request knowledgeable scholars to throw light on this interesting  
point of view.
