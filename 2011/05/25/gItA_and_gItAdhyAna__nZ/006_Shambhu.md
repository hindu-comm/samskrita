On the DhyAnashlOkas:  
  
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Gita_dharshan/message/973> - author is  
noted here. Is this true?  
<http://sanatanapages.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/gita-dhyana-sloka-9/> -  
doubt on Adi Shankara as the author.  
<http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/bhakti/archives/jul2000/0126.html> - doubt  
on Adi Shankara as the author.  
  
The first two links in Brian mahOdaya’s post pertain to a great  
spiritual being, Shridhara Swami ji, of recent time. He attained  
samADhi in 1973 at his Varadahalli Ashrama near Sagara, Karnataka  
state. I have been to that Ashrama.  
  
<http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/IDF097/> - content posted by  
Arvind ji is in this book by Swami Ranganathananda (1908-2005), 13th  
President of Ramakrishna Mata and Mission: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Ranganathananda>.
