Shambhu,  
  
The question of quality and extent of the indigenous educational  
system is a contentious issue and my posting has nothing to do with  
it. Let us not expand the scope of this thread. Instead, let us keep  
it focused.  
  
I shall repeat my pointed question. Did Gita bacome a major  
philosophical work BECAUSE Shankaracharya brought fame to it through  
his commentary or was it known as a major work even before him? If  
the answer is in the affirmative, what are the known works on Gita  
prior to Shankaracharya?
