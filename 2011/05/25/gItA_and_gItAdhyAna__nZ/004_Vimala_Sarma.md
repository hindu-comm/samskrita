You may be right in thinking it was AdiShankarAchArya who popularised the GItA. Certainly his commentary with Advaitin slant has influenced all subsequent Indian commentators. It has actually got strands of SAmkhya, yoga, brahman (neuter ) and the theistic KRSNa philosophy. The personality of K in the rest of the story on MB is different being that of a politician and leader. You may be interested to know that there are other philosophical tracks in MB, particularly SanatsujAta in 5th book (chapters 40-45), MokSadharma in 12th book (chapts 174-367), and AnugItA in 14th book (chap 16-51). The MokSadharma is mainly SAmkhya. It was period of rivalry between philosophical schools.

Dear Group,

The extract from Swami VivekAnanda in the previous posting seem to  
suggest that it was AdiShankarAchArya, who took out the 700 and odd  
verses, otherwise submerged in the BhIShmaparva, and brought them into  
prominence as a separate text called BhagavadgItA. If this is indeed  
so, that is, if the GitA as a philosophical text was unrecognized  

prior to noticing it and writing a commentary upon

  
it, it would make the AchArya its ‘author’, so to speak.

I do not have enough learning to say how the gItA text was looked upon  
prior to AchArya. Are any commentaries or anything else available  
from pre-8th century to suggest that gItA, by itself, was considered a  
significant philosophical text pre-8th century?

I request knowledgeable scholars to throw light on this interesting  
point of view.

Arvind Kolhatkar, Toronto, May 25, 2011.
