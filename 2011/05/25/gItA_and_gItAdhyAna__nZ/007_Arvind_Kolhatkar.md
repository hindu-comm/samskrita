Dear Group,  
  
Upon reading Brianji’s and Shambhuji’s posting, I may say that there  
appear to be two different Acharyas, both named Shridharswami.  
  
The first one, who lived 3 or 4 centuries ago, is a commentator of  
gItA and bhAgavata, as also a likely composer of gItAdhyAna shlokas.  
(Please see the website mentioned in my initial posting  
<http://sites.google.com/site/universalbhagavadgita/>. Another snippet  
that I found about this Shridharswami is that he lived in the temple  
called KapilAsha in the Dhenkanal District of Orissa. Please see  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapilash_Temple>. The composer of the well-  
known Marathi devotional stotra called ShivalIlAmrita is also a  
Shridhar, who apparently had some connection with the town of  
Baramati, because the two old temples in Baramati, Siddheshwar and  
Kashivishvesvar are mentioned in ShivalIlAmrita, though I cannot say  
whether he is the same Shridhar as the earlier mentioned one who wrote  
a commentary on gItA and bhAgavata.  
  
The other Shridharswami lived in the 20th century (1908-73). The  
Wikipedia entry on him <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreedhar_Swami>  
gives brief facts about his life and his association with the Samartha  
Sampradaya of Sajjangad, the hill-fort near Satara which was the place  
where the 17th century teacher Samartha Ramdas spent the last years of  
his life. I had seen this Shridharswami in person at Sajjangad  
sometime in the early 50’s on the occasion of Dasanavami, the  
puNyatithi of Samartha Ramdas. As I recall, there were two rival  
factions at Sajjangad, one of which acknowledged this Shridharswami as  
the spiritual leader of the Samartha Sampradaya. The Wikipedia entry  
does not mention any gItA commentary as written by him. He does not  
look like the composer of the GitAdhyAna shlokas as they appear to be  
traditional and therefore much older than the 20th century. I myself  
have known them since the 1940’s.  
  
A link in Shambhuji’s message, <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Gita_dharshan/message/973>  
suggests one more name for the authorship of gItAdhyAna shlokas.  
  
\<These Dhyanashlokas were composed by the great acharya Madhusudhana  
Saraswati (c.1540–1640), who was a strong proponent of advaita. He  
composed the Dhyanaslokas prior to composing a commentary on Gita  
titled "Gudartha Dipika" (meaning a lamp which illumines the hidden  
and deeper meanings of Gita).>  
  
More information about Madhusudhana Saraswati is available at  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhus%C5%ABdana_Sarasvat%C4%AB>. The  
Banglapedia entry <http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/M_0030.HTM>  
gives some more information about him and indicates his dates as  
1525-1632, which would make him 107 years old when he died.  
  
My thanks to Shambhuji for identifying the narrator in  
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Gita_dharshan/message/973> as Swami  
Ranganathanand, 1908-2005, the thirteenth head of the Ramakrishna  
Mission.
