Friends,

  

Regardingthe गीताध्यान ... 

  

I seem to have stumbled upon the name of the author of relevant material that Arvind brought to our attention, in the Google Groups web page created by Girish S.V., called 'Universal Bhagavad Gita' . 

  

It turns out that Girish S.V. had begun posting material to that Google Groups web page from a book by a Ramakrishna Order swami, the late and highly regarded Sw. Ranganathananda. I found this out while reading a Wikipedia article, on the गीताध्यान . Here is the Ranganathananda citation for the material that Arvind quoted:  

  

[Ranganathananda, (Swami)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Ranganathananda "Swami Ranganathananda") (2000). [*Universal message of the Bhagavad Gita: An exposition of the Gita in the light of modern thought and modern needs (Vol. 1)*](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Message-Bhagavad-Gita-Exposition/dp/8175052139#reader_8175052139)



. Calcutta: Advaita Ashrama. [ISBN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number "International Standard Book Number")[8175052139](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/8175052139 "Special:BookSources/8175052139").

  

In this book, as we see from quotes that Arvind sent in, the learned swami hazards an evidently common opinion that Sridhara Swami composed the Gita Dhyanam.   

  

So we have a difference among experts about the composition of this beautiful invocation.

  

As forthe Vaiṣṇavīya Tantrasāra, cited by the other experts... 

  

I would be very glad if anyone could provide information about the वैष्णवीय तन्त्रसार . Does anyone know how onemightlocate the text to this tantric scripture? 

  

The key for this discussion would be whether or not this work includes the गीताध्यान .I would be glad to obtain it by Interlibrary Loan, if it were available in any library connected with World Cat., so as to look through it in search of the गीताध्यान .

  

Bringing the two lines of inquiry together, perhaps Sridhara Swami composed the Vaiṣṇavīya Tantrasāra. Howeever, the links I provided in my previous message in this thread said nothing of that.
