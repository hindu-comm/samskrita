Dear Group,  

  

I would like to summarize our findings regarding the DhyānaŚlokas. 

  

We now have seen these works and/or great teachers cited as 'the' original source: Vaiṣņavīya Tantrasāra, Adi Śankarācārya himself, Shridhara Swami of some centuries ago, Shridhara Swami of recent times, and Madhusudhana Saraswati.

  

Could it be that no one knows the source? If that is the case, I find it odd that respected authors state one source or another with evident certainty, not hedging their bets at all. But none of them actually provides specifics since if they had, the origin would not remain a mystery. It is as though each is relying on hear-say evidence, and not checking their references.

  

Ifone of these earlier proposed authors, such as for example Adi Śankarācārya, quotes the actual text, that would at least establish a 'not later than' date for its composition. Perhaps one of the members knows of this?

  

And by the way... 



Following Arvindji’s lead, my thanks also to Shambhuji for identifying Swami Ranganathananda as the author of the quote. Pardon me for also announcing this. Due to an oddity of when Google Groups posts messages, I did not see Shanbhu’s message with this information, prior to sending out mine.



Thanks too, to Arvindji for distinguishing, at least tentatively, between two great teachers and saints, both named Shridhara Swami.

  

Brian
