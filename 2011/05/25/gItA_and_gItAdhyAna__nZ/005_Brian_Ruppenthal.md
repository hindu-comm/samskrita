Dear Group,

  

I have found two sources that cite a work I have never heard of, the Vaiṣņavīya Tantrasāra, as the source for the Invocation to the Bhagavad Gita a.k.a., Gita DhyAnam, or the dhyAna shlokas, namely S. Radhakrishnan and Nataraja Guru:

  

Radhakrishnan, S. (1993). The Bhagavadgita: With an introductory essay, Sanskrit text, English translation, and notes. New Delhi: HarperCollins. ISBN [8172230877](tel:(817)%20223-0877).

  

Guru, Nataraja (1973). The Bhagavad gita: A sublime hymn of dialectics composed by the antique sage-bard vyasa. Asia Publishing House.

  

On the other hand, I could not confirm that Sridhara Swami might be the author, by simple Google search. Take a look yourself at these representative links if you'd care to:

  

<http://www.bharathagnana.com/2008/11/sridhara-swami-guru-charitre.html>

<http://www.sadgurubhagwanshreedharswamimaharaj.com/>

<http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/Commentaries/rudra-intro.html>

  

In this third of three links above, we can see thatSridhara Swami indeed wrote a commentary on the Gita. And we can read his Invocation to the Gita, at the page that I link to above. It is not the same work as what we have been researching here, namely the Gita Dhyana Shlokas.

  

Does anyone have information about theVaiṣņavīya Tantrasāra? For instance, might it have a known author? And how ancient or recent a text might it be? I cannot find the text nor, so far, any book listed in World Cat containing the text.

  

Also, can others confirm that the Dhyana Shokas are indeed there in that tantric scripture?

  

Brian
