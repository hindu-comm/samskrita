For certainty,Śankarācārya himself doesn't quote these shloka-s, as in all the versions, his commentary on Bhagavadgita, begins with the 2nd chapter introducing the philosophic content beginning with अशोच्यानन्वशोचस्त्वं etc. with a summary of the preceding portion. And as the DhyAna-shloka-s have little philosophical content, in themselves, he has not possibly quoted. VaishNava- sources may have quoted them, but somewhere they should have originated during the transmission of the text for religious purpose and उपासना which is part and parcel of Tantra-s than philosophy.

  

Vaishnava-tantra may not be a specific Tantra text, or some abridged version TantrasAra, based on पाञ्चरात्र or other VaishNavaite Tantra. It is a larger field to survey and without specific chronology like the PurANa-s.



When it became appended to the text of BhagavadgitA available is still a question without any specific answer without definite chronology assessable to the texts.
