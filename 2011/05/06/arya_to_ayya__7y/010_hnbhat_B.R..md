I don't think it could be aajja - but most likely in the prakrit dialects it becomes like ayya, ajja with only short a preceding a conjunct (of cognate ones as is usual for Prakrit assimilation) and not long "aa" I could expect, unless there is any special rule in Pali grammar to retain the longer vowel. In other words, the longer vowels could not be followed by any conjunct letters. and even if it requires, one of the conjunct letters will be lost as a rule. कस्स, or कास. and not both conjunct and longer vowel preceding. I do not quote the rule, as I do not know the rule of Pali grammar, but only of Prakrit dialects. Probably Mm. Vimala may shed light on this issue who is working with Pali texts, like MilindapaNha.

  

With regards
