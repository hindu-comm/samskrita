Here is the etymology of Arya undergone different phases:

  

आर्य(ā́rya)m  
  
(primary) an Indo-Aryan, i.e. an Ārya-, a self-designator of the peoples of Ancient India who speak Ārya language (ārya-bhāšā-)  
  
a speaker of the language of the Vedas (opposed toअनार्य(an-ārya),दस्यु(dasyu),दास(dāsa))  
an inhabitant ofआर्यावर्त(āryā.varta)  
a member of theārya.varna.  
one who is favourable to theĀrya-people/cause (RV.etc.)  
  
(secondary) a person having the self-ascribed qualities of a speaker of Ārya language  
  
a respectable, honourable, faithful man  
one who is faithful to the religion of his country  
a man highly esteemed, arespectable,honourableman (Pañcat.,Śak.etc.)  
in later times name of the first three castes, compareārya.varna(opposed toशूद्र(śūdra)) (lateRV.,AV.,VS.,MBh.,Yājñ.,Pañcat.etc.)  
anarí-, amaster, anowner(L.)  
anaryamán, afriend(L.)  
aवैश्य(vaiśya)(L.)  
  
(from developments in Buddhist/Pali usage)  
  
Buddha  
(Buddhism)a man who has thought on the four chief truths of Buddhism and lives accordingly, aBuddhistpriest (Paliअय्यो(ayyo), orअरियो(ariyo))  
  

There are two words आर्य and अर्य cognates. Of these, "अर्यः स्वामिवैश्ययोः" (३.१.१०३*अर्यः = स्वामी, वैश्यः);*आर्यो ब्राह्मणः;

*  
*

This is the distinction between the meaning. Tamil அய்ய can be directly derived from the Sanskritअर्यः directly without any transference of meaning. स्वामिन् , who is also derived as one having wealth, land lord in later meaning:*स्वामिन्नैश्वर्ये*\|( ५. २. १२६) ऐश्वर्य means lordship also. So Ayya is the directly descended from Ayya.

  

  

For the usages on Arya, is honorable address to any respectable persons in general. But it is associated with putra as आर्यपुत्र addressing the husband, i.e. father-in=law's son literally in dramatic language and occasionally epic language. It is the term used by women to call their husbands in dramatic language. I think this much is enough for the time being. Here is the Dravidian Etymology Dictionary entry for the word ayya:
