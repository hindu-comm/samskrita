Dear madam,

  

It can be possibly a case of double suffixation.

  

ayya \>\> ayya+ar - ayya_ar_kaL \>\> ayyar(n)\_gAr(u)

  

It is not infrequent in Dravidian languages the use of double suffix.
In this case, it differs between variants of the same suffix developed independently in Telugu and Tamil languages.

The above is an answer in [yaahoo.com](http://yaahoo.com) and in practical purposes, they are distinguished by their cultural affinity and difference of the two groups of Bhrahmins as explained by P Ramakrishnan. It can be see in this page:

Here is the viky page distinguishing both communities by their cultural backgrounds. It is with this "pancasamskAra" which our learned friend Ramakrishnan seems to have relied upon to derive it as arayn + kara - indicating the customary samskAra, which the other group do not have.

  

Hope this will be of some help in the discussion.
