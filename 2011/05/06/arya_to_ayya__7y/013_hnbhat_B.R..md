Thanks madam for confirming the form I had guessed. In any case, it has shortened its initial long vowel. like in other Prakrit derivations of the word. 

  

I too got the correct form as ariya. What this phonetical change is called? It is common to Sanskrit too. Like पृथ्वी, पृथिवी, स्वर्णम्, सुवर्णम्. etc. It is the same with Dravidian languages too directly using the Sanskrit words as sama-samskrita , ariya, as in Tamil. Metathesis is too general term, but I do not remember the term for the precise phonetic change.
