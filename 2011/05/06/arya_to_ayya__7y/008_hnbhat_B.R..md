Just I was about to ask the question. Anyhow, you have raised it. I looked for it and got the answer by a Sri Mani Varadarajan:

Here is the complete answer for the doctrinal differences:

And here is another explanation by one V Venkat Rao:

in some more detail. Here is another discussion thread with more details by Tamil Brahmins forum by highly knowledgeable members:

  

<http://www.tamilbrahmins.com/philosophy-traditions/3193-vaishnavism-vadagalai-thengalai.html>

  

According to one view, among Vadagalai, brahmins themselves, there are two groups, accepting Ramanujar as their guru and Ramanurar had both Vadagalai and Thengalai disciples.



  

Here is our common source vikipedia the related page:

Hope this will be enough. More discussions and informations would certainly be found on the net on different pages by different bloggers.
