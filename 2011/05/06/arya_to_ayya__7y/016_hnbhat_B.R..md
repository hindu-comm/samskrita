In connection with above, the Magadhi, of Jain religious/philosophical litrature (Ardhamagadhi), that of Dramatic Literature (cognate of Sauraseni and other dialects), the one assigned later a name*Pālī*used in Buddhist Litrature religous and Jatakakatha, is different in minor details from the above.It assimilated the Vedic forms too in its conjugational system and also from Ardhamāgadhī of Jains. It is distinguished from the dramatic Prākrit languages, in as much as that it assimilates from Classical Sanskrit too in its derived forms. It is considered to be a sister language of Vedic sanskrit also by scholars and certainly earlier than the later dramatic Prakrit dialects. Maharashtri has got its own literature, apart from dramatic Sauraseni. Setubandha is the earliest known Mahakavya, considered as the representative of its genre, by Dandin while defining Mahakavya.

  

The arihanta is the Prākrit form of arhat, an epithet used to Jain monks as well as Buddha also:

  

{an}) m. a Buddha who is still a candidate for Nirva1n2a ; (= %{kSapaNaka}) a Jaina ; an Arhat or superior divinity with the Jainas ; the highest rank in the Buddhist hierarchy L..



The popular*ṇamokara mantra*of Jains is ṇamo arihantāṇaṃ seems to be used in respects of Tirthankara-s lineage. From Rgvedic usage, the term has undergone many changes in the shades of uses of it according to the theology into which it is adopted.

  

The words Buddha and Jina are listed as synonyms, while Shakyamuni Gautama (buddha) is separately listed by Amarasimha. A more synthetic and liberal approach is reflected in this verse:

  

> यं शैवा: समुपासते शिव इति ब्रह्मेति वेदान्तिनो  
> बौद्धा बुद्ध इति प्रमाणपटव: कर्तेति नैयायिका:।  
> अर्हन्नित्यथ जैनशासनरता: कर्मेति मीमांसका:  
> सोऽयं लो विदधातु वांछितफलं त्रैलोक्यनाथो हरि:।।

  

in spite of Amara treating them as synonyms.
