Dear Bhat Mahodaya

I was composing a response when I was interrupted so you may get a another half-finished version of this e-mail.



The rule where a vowel is added to separate conjunct consonants is called svarabhakti or epithenthesis.



Ariya is not a social group or a caste but refers to arhants (worthy ones) who have reached an awakened state. Hence ariyas like gentlemen are made, not born.

In the dramas the prAkrit spoken by the noble ladies is mAhArASTrI from south of the Narmada, and the servants in dramas spoke mAgadhI – both these are Middle prAkrits. All these were spoken at the same time as can be seen in kAlidAsa’s plays, and understood by everyone including non-speakers of the dialects. pAli is an older form of Prakrit and shows both Eastern and Western features as though scribes who were speakers of the Eastern and Western prAkrits were translating from Snaskrit and then the language became standardised. The language is considered by most people as Mauryan from the East (similar to the dialect on the edicts) spoken in the time of Asoka, and the scriptures are from the stAvIravAdins (theravAdins) which were considered to be widespread in the East at the time of Ashoka.



Hope this helps.

Vimala

Thanks madam for confirming the form I had guessed. In any case, it has shortened its initial long vowel. like in other Prakrit derivations of the word.
