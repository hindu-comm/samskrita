You are right in assessing that the word preceding both the quotations refer to some text by हिरण्यगर्भ. It does not refer to हिरण्यगर्भ सूक्त in Rgveda which begins with हिरण्यगर्भः समवर्तताग्रे भूतस्य जातः ([Rigveda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda)([RV 10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_10 "RV 10").121) a Sukta by the sage of the same name. Oneहिरण्यगर्भ is aVedanta teacher(according to Monier William)whose work is not known so far.May be the same, work is referred to here. There is mention of a Yoga teacher prior to Patanjali, in Mahabharata:

> (MBh, 12, 337, 60)  
> hiraṇyagarbhoyogasya vettā nānyaḥ purātanaḥ //



But the work is not know, I suppose. It may be this Yoga work of HiraNyagarbha, that Sri Sankara refers. But somebody may know the work and find some light on it. It may be a Yoga work or a Vedanta work. The quoted portion provides definition for the terms in the verses 1.41 and 42 that is commented. But without the source at hand and the context, only a literal translation may be possible. Even that presupposes the reader well acquainted with the concepts of Vedanta. Otherwise, it may need another commentary on the concepts.

  

  

1\.

**अन्नाङ्गनादिभोगेषु भावो मान इति स्मृतः\|**

**ब्रह्मानन्दसुखप्राप्तिहेतुर् मौनंइति स्मृतः\|\|**



The enjoyment of the mundane pleasure of food and women and the like is called मान (as explained by by Sankara). No idea how it can be derived out of this word. It may be intended to convey अभिमान or ego in general. All the activity initiated by the enjoyment of mundane pleasure is called मान or produced by ego. (अहंकार). This can be the meaning intended in the context.

The second activity which is the cause of attaining the pleasure of attaining the bliss of Supreme Being (BrahmAnanda) (which is a popular concept in Upanishadic philosophy) as characteristic of Brahma) is called मौन. (the state of being Muni which is the cause of achieving realization of Brahmananda)

The theories differ from each Shastra in regard to this. The term Muni is well defined in Bhagavad Geeta itself. 

  

Quote #2, from Śaṃkara’s*Sanatsujātīya**Bhāṣya*in the context of commenting on*Sanatsujātīya*1:42:



**या नित्या चिद्धनान्दना गुणरूपविवर्जिता\|**

**आनन्दाख्या परा शुद्धा ब्राह्मी श्रीरिति कथ्यते\|\|**



yā nityā ciddhanāndanā guṇarūpavivarjitā\|

ānandākhyā parā śuddhā brāhmī śrīriti kathyate\|\|

  

This is rather uncommon concept in Vedanta, but metaphoric expression of realization of Brahma. The expression is in the text itself, two kinds of श्री and the same is explained in accordance with the one in the second half of the verse commented. The metaphorical expression application to both is equivalent of सम्पत्ति figuratively both in the first half and the second half. accomplishment or achievement can be taken roughly corresponding idea. The quoted portion seems to define the state of realization of Brahman in contrast to the prior one which aims the achievement of celestial pleasure (through the Vedic rites). This shrI attained by मौन defined in the previous verse, is permanent, dense bliss of the eternal (being) चिद्-घनानन्दा , devoid of any form and attributes, known as the foremost bliss, pure realization is called the श्रीः belonging to the Supreme Being (ब्रह्म) (In other words the achievement of realization of the Supreme Being is called as ब्राह्मी श्रीः)

  

Hope this is a literal translation with some comments added make the idea clear.



More comments on this from the learned members are highly solicited.
