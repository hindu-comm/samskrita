Friends,

  

Continuing on the two verses I am trying to locate, from Śrīmat Shankara’s Sanatsujātīya Bhāṣya...

  

Thank you both, Sunder Hattangadi and Dr. Hari Bhatt, for your helpful replies to my query. 

  

Sunder, thanks especially for finding mention at least of the Hiraṇyagarbha Saṃhitā. "In manuscript form only" would apparently mean that I will not find that scriptural work on-line?... so as to check for the two verses. In fact, I can't locate the work through Worldcat.org either, i.e., as a book available for borrowing through Interlibrary Loan. This is evidently an obscure work.  

  

But another issue crops up here. Shankara definitely writes हैरण्यगर्भे and not हिरण्यगर्भे . Why would he apply vṛddhi to the initial vowel like that, if the work is called the hiraṇyagarbha saṃhitā?

  

Not that I expect anyone to know for sure, since it does appear that I am looking into obscure matters. For instance, it seems plausible or even likely that the actual scripture no longer exists, that Shankara refers to here.

  

Again, thanks to you two for your most helpful deliberations and insights. If anyone cares to continue, it will be much appreciated.

  

Brian

The work referred to as 'hiraNyagarbhe' is the 'hiraNyagarbha saMhitA' 9(Sw. Amritananda'a translation, Ramakrishna Math publication).  
  
This is one of the 110 saMhita-s collected at:  
<http://www.kamakotimandali.com/misc/PancharatraSamhita.html> (available in manuscript form only)  
  
Another translation of the 2 verses by S.N.Sastri is at:  
  
<http://www.celextel.org/othervedantabooks/sanatsujatiyam.html>  
  
na vai mAnaSca maunam ca sahitau vasatah sadA \|  
ayam mAnasya vishayo hyasau maunasya tadviduh \|\|41  
41. Honour and contemplation cannot co-exist. Honour has as its sphere this world, while contemplation has as its object brahman. (The idea is that those who aspire for honour have their sights fixed on worldly activities, while the contemplatives are rooted in brahman).  
  
SrIrhi mAnArthasamvAsAt

42. One acquires worldly prosperity if one is engaged in the sphere relating to honour (worldly activities). But this is an obstacle (to liberation). The wealth that is brahman is impossible to get for such a person who is devoid of wisdom.

You are right in assessing that the word preceding both the quotations refer  

to some text by हिरण्यगर्भ. It does not refer to हिरण्यगर्भ सूक्त in Rgveda  
which begins with हिरण्यगर्भः समवर्तताग्रे भूतस्य जातः  

(Rigveda\<<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda>\>  
(RV 10 \<<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_10>\>.121) a Sukta by the sage of the  

same name. One हिरण्यगर्भ is a Vedanta teacher (according to Monier  

William) whose work is not known so far. May be the same, work is  

referred to here. There is mention of a Yoga teacher prior to Patanjali, in  
Mahabharata:  
  
\> (MBh, 12, 337, 60)  
\> hiraṇyagarbho yogasya vettā nānyaḥ purātanaḥ //  
  
But the work is not know, I suppose. It may be this Yoga work of  

HiraNyagarbha, that Sri Sankara refers. But somebody may know the work and  
find some light on it. It may be a Yoga work or a Vedanta work. The quoted  
portion provides definition for the terms in the verses 1.41 and 42 that is  
commented. But without the source at hand and the context, only a literal  
translation may be possible. Even that presupposes the reader well  
acquainted with the concepts of Vedanta. Otherwise, it may need another  
commentary on the concepts.  
  
1.  
  

\*अन्नाङ्गनादिभोगेषु भावो मान इति स्मृतः \*\*\|\*  
  
\*ब्रह्मानन्दसुखप्राप्तिहेतुर् मौनं\*\* \*\*इति स्मृतः \*\*\|\|\*  

  
The enjoyment of the mundane pleasure of food and women and the like is  

called मान (as explained by by Sankara). No idea how it can be derived out  
of this word. It may be intended to convey अभिमान or ego in general. All the  
activity initiated by the enjoyment of mundane pleasure is called मान or  
produced by ego. (अहंकार). This can be the meaning intended in the context.  
The second activity which is the cause of attaining the pleasure of  
attaining the bliss of Supreme Being (BrahmAnanda) (which is a popular  
concept in Upanishadic philosophy) as characteristic of Brahma) is called  
मौन. (the state of being Muni which is the cause of achieving realization of  
Brahmananda)  
The theories differ from each Shastra in regard to this. The term Muni is  
well defined in Bhagavad Geeta itself.  
  

Quote #2, from Śaṃkara’s \*Sanatsujātīya\*\* Bhāṣya \* in the context of  
commenting on \*Sanatsujātīya\* 1:42:  
  
\*या नित्या चिद्धनान्दना गुणरूपविवर्जिता \*\*\|\*  
  
\*आनन्दाख्या परा शुद्धा ब्राह्मी श्रीरिति कथ्यते \*\*\|\|\*  

  
yā nityā ciddhanāndanā guṇarūpavivarjitā \|  
  
ānandākhyā parā śuddhā brāhmī śrīriti kathyate \|\|  
  

This is rather uncommon concept in Vedanta, but metaphoric expression of  
realization of Brahma. The expression is in the text itself, two kinds of  
श्री and the same is explained in accordance with the one in the second half  
of the verse commented. The metaphorical expression application to both is  
equivalent of सम्पत्ति figuratively both in the first half and the second  
half. accomplishment or achievement can be taken roughly corresponding idea.  
The quoted portion seems to define the state of realization of Brahman in  
contrast to the prior one which aims the achievement of celestial pleasure  

(through the Vedic rites). This shrI attained by मौन defined in the previous  
verse, is permanent, dense bliss of the eternal (being) चिद्-घनानन्दा  
, devoid  
of any form and attributes, known as the foremost bliss, pure realization is  
called the श्रीः belonging to the Supreme Being (ब्रह्म) (In other words the  
achievement of realization of the Supreme Being is called as ब्राह्मी  
श्रीः)  
  
Hope this is a literal translation with some comments added make the idea  
clear.  
  
More comments on this from the learned members are highly solicited.
