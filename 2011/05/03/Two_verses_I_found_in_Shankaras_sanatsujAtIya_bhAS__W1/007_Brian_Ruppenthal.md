Thanks for the helpful responses.  

  

श्रीमल्ललितालालित स्वाध्यायस्यामि तव सन्देशम् \|\|

  

Sunder, this quote by David Frawley, from one of the links, probably sums the matter up: "While no single simple Hiranyagarbha Yoga Sutras text has survived, quite a few of its teachings have remained."

  

Dr. Hari Bhat, I found your interpretations and insights most helpful.
In particular, this from you seems very good indeed: " This shrI attained by मौन defined in the previous verse, is permanent, dense bliss of the eternal (being) चिद्-घनानन्दा , devoid of any form and attributes, known as the foremost bliss, pure realization is called the श्रीः belonging to the Supreme Being (ब्रह्म) (In other words the achievement of realization of the Supreme Being is called as ब्राह्मी
श्रीः)"
