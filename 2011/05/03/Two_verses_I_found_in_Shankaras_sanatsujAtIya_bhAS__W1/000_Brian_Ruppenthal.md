Friends,

  

In reading into Śrīmat Shankara’s Sanatsujātīya Bhāṣya, I came across two verses which puzzle me*.* In both cases Shankarācarya introduces these as ‘hairaṇyagarbhe’ -- which evidently means, “in the Hairaṇyagarbha...” ??? After introducing each with that title or descriptor and after quoting the verses, in both cases, he provides the customary ‘iti’ signifying the end of a quote.



Here are the verses:



Quote #1, from Śaṃkara’s *Sanatsujātīya** Bhāṣya* in the context of commenting on *Sanatsujātīya* 1:41:



**अन्नाङ्गनादिभोगेषु भावो मान इति स्मृतः \|**

**ब्रह्मानन्दसुखप्राप्तिहेतुर् मौनं इति स्मृतः \|\|**



annāṅganādibhogeṣu bhāvo māna iti smṛtaḥ \|

brahmānandasukhaprāptihetur maunaṁ iti smṛtaḥ \|\|



Quote #2, from Śaṃkara’s *Sanatsujātīya** Bhāṣya *in the context of commenting on *Sanatsujātīya* 1:42:



**या नित्या चिद्धनान्दना गुणरूपविवर्जिता \|**

**आनन्दाख्या परा शुद्धा ब्राह्मी श्रीरिति कथ्यते \|\|**



yā nityā ciddhanāndanā guṇarūpavivarjitā \|

ānandākhyā parā śuddhā brāhmī śrīriti kathyate \|\|



Questions: 1. Can any of the learned members identify the work, or works, that these two verses may come from? Is there, for example, a text called the Hairaṇyagarbha?



2. And how might anyone here translate these two verses? I have my guesses of course. But I hesitate to reveal them, out of respect for others in this group who are so much more proficient. 



By the way, I gather that the word ‘hairaṇyagarbha’ can refer to philosophers who hold that creation arose out of the Hiraṇyagarbha, the so-called golden womb or egg. So ‘Hairaṇyagarbha’ might refer to such a one. But putting the word in the locative does seem to imply a scriptural work or some such.
