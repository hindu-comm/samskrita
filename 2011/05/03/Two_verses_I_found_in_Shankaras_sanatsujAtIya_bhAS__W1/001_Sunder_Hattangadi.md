The work referred to as 'hiraNyagarbhe' is the 'hiraNyagarbha saMhitA' 9(Sw. Amritananda'a translation, Ramakrishna Math publication).



This is one of the 110 saMhita-s collected at:

<http://www.kamakotimandali.com/misc/PancharatraSamhita.html>
(available in manuscript form only)



Another translation of the 2 verses by S.N.Sastri is at:

41\. Honour and contemplation cannot co-exist. Honour has as its sphere this world, while contemplation has as its object brahman. (The idea is that those who aspire for honour have their sights fixed on worldly activities, while the contemplatives are rooted in brahman).

42. One acquires worldly prosperity if one is engaged in the sphere relating to honour (worldly activities). But this is an obstacle (to liberation). The wealth that is brahman is impossible to get for such a person who is devoid of wisdom.

**Subject:** \[Samskrita\] Two verses I found in Shankara’s Sanatsujātīya Bhāṣya  
  

Friends,

  

In reading into Śrīmat Shankara’s Sanatsujātīya Bhāṣya, I came across two verses which puzzle me*.* In both cases Shankarācarya introduces these as ‘hairaṇyagarbhe’ -- which evidently means, “in the Hairaṇyagarbha...” ??? After introducing each with that title or descriptor and after quoting the verses, in both cases, he provides the customary ‘iti’ signifying the end of a quote.



Here are the verses:



Quote #1, from Śaṃkara’s *Sanatsujātīya** Bhāṣya* in the context of commenting on *Sanatsujātīya* 1:41:



**अन्नाङ्गनादिभोगेषु भावो मान इति स्मृतः \|**

**ब्रह्मानन्दसुखप्राप्तिहेतुर् मौनं इति स्मृतः \|\|**



annāṅganādibhogeṣu bhāvo māna iti smṛtaḥ \|

brahmānandasukhaprāptihetur maunaṁ iti smṛtaḥ \|\|



Quote #2, from Śaṃkara’s *Sanatsujātīya** Bhāṣya *in the context of commenting on *Sanatsujātīya* 1:42:



**या नित्या चिद्धनान्दना गुणरूपविवर्जिता \|**

**आनन्दाख्या परा शुद्धा ब्राह्मी श्रीरिति कथ्यते \|\|**



yā nityā ciddhanāndanā guṇarūpavivarjitā \|

ānandākhyā parā śuddhā brāhmī śrīriti kathyate \|\|



Questions: 1. Can anyone identify the work, or works, that these two verses may come from? Is there, for example, a text called the Hairaṇyagarbha?
