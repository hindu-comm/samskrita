All are generalized by Panini in his Ashtadhyayi. Only individual cases differ according to the words inflected following the rules related to type of derivation in question. If you know Paninian Grammar, it would be easier for you to follow the general and exceptional rule for such secondary derivatives, technically called "taddhita" vast in its scope even for a grammarian. It depends on the context to analyse their meaning and the derivation following the context. Generally it is a suffix is prescribed to one's name or a word to show any thing/person related to the person/thing. In the above case, if you mean, the son, or daughter, it is the same suffix aN which modifies the word to which attached accordingly in masculine or feminine gender in all the cases. All the derivation is difficult to be presented here unless you know certain amount of Paninian grammar.

  

दशरथस्य अपत्यम् - "तस्यापत्यम्" "अत इञ्"

दशरथ + इ \>\> दाशरथ + इ \>\> दाशरथि \>\> दाशरथिः = son of दशरथ

But the suffix changes in case of different words differently and in according to the meaning intended. Hope other members would throw much light with a light treatment.

You can always call your daughter by the name you have given on her nAmakaraNa rite. or any pet name you like.
