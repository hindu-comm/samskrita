Namaste,  
  
I have a long lingering doubt on how some words are derived/ formed, and if there is a grammer rule that governs this -  
  
janakasya putrI jAnaki  
  
vidihA nagara yuvara\~jI vaidEhI  
  
dasarathasya putraH dAsharathiH  
  
bhagIrathH - bhAgIrathI  
  
jahnuH - jAhnavI  
  
jamadagnIH - jAmadagniH (parashurAmaH)  
  
himavantaH - haimavathI  
  
  
etc.. Can you please throw some light generalizing this. Some times, the last few letters are changing, and some times the first letters change. Is there some rules that governs such derivatives ?  
  
Given my name is vishvanAthaH, how do i call my daughter ? :-)  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
