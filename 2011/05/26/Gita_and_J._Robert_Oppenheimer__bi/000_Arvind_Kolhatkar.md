Dear Group,

It is well-known that Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Chief Scientist of the Manhattan Project that secretly built the Atom Bomb, had studied Sanskrit in 1933 at Berkeley and had developed a love of the Bhagavad-Gita. It continued to fascinate him for the rest of his life.

It is also known that the following verses from Ch. 11 of the Gita went through his mind when the first bomb was successfully tested in the desert of New Mexico on July 16, 1945:

दिवि सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्युगपदुत्थिता।

यदि भाः सदृशी सा स्याद् भासस्तस्य महात्मनः॥१२॥

कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो

लोकान्समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः।...॥३२॥



Oppenheimer had pacifist and leftist leanings and entertained doubts as to whether developing atom bombs would be for the good of the humanity or not. Yet, as the Chief Scientist of the Manhattan Project he devoted himself entirely to building the bomb, as he saw it as his duty. In this he was influenced by the Gita. These doubts eventually cost him dearly. Some years down the line, he was investigated for his leftist sympathies and stripped of his security clearance.



I enclose below for whom it may be of interest a paper titled ‘The Gita of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ by Prof. James A. Hijiya, from the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, No 144, No. 2.
