Vidya,  
  
You say that  

  
\<This story was a later concoction. He had read the Gita in  
translation but did not quote it at the time of the explosion.  
According to those who were with him at the time, which included my  

former professor Emil Konopinski, he simply said "It works”.>  
  
Of course he did not loudly utter out the Gita verses at the time of  
the experimental explosion of the first atom bomb, if that is what you  
mean by the word ‘concoction’. Nobody, and nor I in my earlier  
posting, have said that Oppenheimer ‘said’ anything from Gita on that  
occasion. The story that is making rounds ever since, which I have  
just picked up in my general reading, is that verses from chapter 11  
of the Gita ‘flashed’ through his mind when he saw the explosion. (See  
footnote 3 in Prof. Hijiya’s paper where he discusses Robert Junck’s  
book, ‘Brighter than a Thousand Suns’. Even this title indicates the  
connexion of Gita quotes with the explosion.)  
  
The source of the story that verses from Gita ‘flashed’ (or passed)  
through Oppenheimer’s mind appears to be Oppenheimer himself. See  
footnote 2 in Prof. Hijiya’s paper where he deals with the 1965 NBC  
documentary ‘The Decision to Drop the Bomb’ and Oppenheimer’s words  
spoken in it. All subsequent documentaries and books have taken up  
the same thread. The only confusion appears to be about the exact  
verse (or rather, its translation) which went through Oppenheimer’s  
mind. But nobody seems to have doubted the veracity of what  
Oppenheimer himself said, that a verse from Gita passed through his  
mind.  
  
As recently as on May 23 of this year I saw on PBS (Buffalo-Toronto) a  
2-hour documentary called ‘The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer’. That  
too repeated the story of Gita verses ‘passing’ through his mind.  
  
…And they could well have. Oppenheimer had studied Sanskrit in 1933  
at Berkeley with Prof. Ryder and from that time onwards there are  
several references to his knowledge  
and love of Sanskrit literature in general and Gita in particular.  
Prof. Hijiya’s paper documents these. Incidentally, Ryder had  
published a translation of Gita by then. Footnote 43 also mentions  
that when asked in 1963 to list the ten books that ‘did most to shape  
your vocational attitude and your philosophy of life’, Oppenheimer  
listed Gita and Bhartrihari’s Shatakatraya among those ten books. Two  
books of the Oriental tradition out of ten is an impressive score.  
  
Thus, given the documented knowledge and love of Gita that Oppenheimer  
had, and his own words that verses from Gita passed through his mind  
at the time of the first explosion, I see no reason to doubt that  
such words indeed passed through his mind.  
  
You bring up what your former professor Emil Konopinski said. The  
learned Professor could only tell you what he heard or did not hear  
from Oppenheimer. Obviously he could not bear witness to what  
‘passed’ through Oppenheimer’s mind. Oppenheimer is the most  
trustworthy witness for that!  
  
I can well understand why Oppenheimer (probably) kept silent about the  
Gita verses passing through his mind in the interview that he gave to  
William Laurence within a few hours after the explosion. (Footnote 3  
in the Hijiya Paper). In the America of the early 1940’s was much  
more myopic about the world beyond its immediate horizon that it is  
today. An exotic reference to a ‘Hindu’ text would have gone over the  
heads of most Americans. They would have dismissed the person  
spouting such ‘knowledge’ as a nutcase. Oppenheimer probably chose to  
keep Gita to himself! (Please see footnote 16).
