"It is also known that the following verses from Ch. 11 of the Gita went through his mind when the first bomb was successfully tested in the desert of New Mexico on July 16, 1945:"

......

"This story was a later concoction. He had read the Gita in translation but did not quote it at the time of the explosion. According to those who were with him at the time, which included my former professor Emil Konopinski, he simply said "It works."  

 Oppenheimer was something of a showman ..., and he made up this story when he was interviewed by Robert Jungk. for his book Brighter Than A Thousand Sons.

You may also refer them to the book*American Prometheus*which is the latest and the best biography og Oppenheimer.

"  Dr. N.S. Rajaram

  

Shri Arvind Kolhatkar, it may best be stated that "It is reported that the following verse ...." rather than "It is also known ...".   What went on in another's mind is not a knowable fact, but only inferrable, or, reported  :)

  

namaste!
