Hi everybody,

There were several discussions about citrakavya recently so I thought you may be interested in a review of a book published by Rasthriya Sanskrit Sansthan: Citram. The book was reviewed by Dr Shankar Rajaraman who is, as some of you will know, an asthavadhani and is particularlyskilled incitra-bandha.

The review is here: <http://granthabooks.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/citram-volume-iii-citrabandha/>

Best,

Venetia
