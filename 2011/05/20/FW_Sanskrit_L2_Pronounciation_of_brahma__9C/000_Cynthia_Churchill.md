When the topic of pronunciation of “brahma” arose in 2009, I saved this interesting e-mail.   
  
Sincerely,

svasti vasuvaj-vara,  
  
aurasya 'h' is the voiced breath without constricting the kaNTha (velar region of the back of the mouth). Many Indians, especially those who take care to pronounce the 'h' BEFORE the 'm' in 'brahma' already pronounce this 'h' without constricting the kaNTha. So no special effort is needed to teach these people. (Also your example of the saMskRta "hyaH" or the word hAM in hindI, hyAlA in marAThI, etc.) The deep sigh of tiredness "hhhhh" is aurasya (though it is sometimes unvoiced). Most Indians also know to pronounce the kaNThya version.  
  
I believe that arabic still maintains the lexical distinction between Haa' (kaNTha - more strongly articulated than saMskRita, more like the 'k/h' in high-draviDian tamizh maha \[meaning son\]) and haa' (aurasya). This distinction is nearly lost for loan words in hindi/urdu, where many people have to actually say "big ha", "small ha" while describing spelling, instead of just listening to a clear sound and writing it. For example, most hindi/urdu speakers do not distinguish between the aurasya hAlA (meaning liquour) and the kaNThya hAlA (meaning "at present"). But highly educated speakers can make the distinction.  
  
This separate issue:  
\> As per the oral tradition, brahma is pronounced as bramha,  
\> prahlada is pronounced as pralhadah, madhyahne is  
\> pronounced as madhyanhe and so on.  
While I agree that such an oral tradition exists, including in my family, this is the simple flow of apabraMsha. We cannot escape the pervading influence of our mother-languages especially in words that appear to be written the same with the same spelling in both saMskRta and our mother-language. An aside: as a marAThI speaker, my family tradition often uses the pronunciation sauMskrut.h (halanta, also note 'ru') instead of saMskRta (akArAnta). While I have great love for my family tradition, I think I should just keep it there :-)  
  
(Just to clarify: While speaking in marAThI, it is most correct for me to say "sauMskrut" - saying "saMskRta" is incorrect. But the opposite is the case while trying to read saMskRta aloud.)  
  
Regards and best wishes,  
Dhananjay
