Many thanks for your valuable guidance in understanding the  
conjugation of the verb कृ and the meaning of the word " कृषीरन् ".  
For the sake of clarity, I am repeating the entire Shloka # 198 of  
Chapter 18, of Mayamatam and its English translation by the author Dr.  
Bruno Dagens of "l'InstitutFrancaisd'Indologie, Pondicherry".

ब्रह्मा विष्णुः शङ्करः सर्वदेवाः  
क्षोणी लक्षमीर्वाग्वधूः सिंहकेतुः।  
ज्येष्ठा विश्चेदेवदेव्यः प्रजानां  
श्रीसौभाग्यारोग्यभोग्यं कृषीरन् ।।198।।

"May BrahmA, VishNu, ShaNkara and all the gods as well as KshoNI,  
Lakshmi, VaagvadhU, SiMhaketu, JyeshThA, and all the goddesses bestow  
upon creatures, happiness, well being, absence of passion and health!"

There has been my typing error in the word ज्येष्ठा. Possibiliy in  
the above context, the word विश्चेदेवदेव्यः could be a samAsa, meaning  
विश्चेदेवाः and विश्चेदेव्यः. In any case, the guidance provided by  
you has helped us in translating the text in Hindi to our  
satisfaction.

Thanks once again.
