The vaishwadEva mantras (agnayE swAhA etc.) are in the  
mahAnArAyaNOpanishad of the tattirIya AraNyaka. A good link is  
<http://yajur.veda.tripod.com/>.  
  
vishwEdEvaH and vishwEdEvAH (singular and plural) usages exit in the  
vEdas. yajussamhita gives the analogy of prANa for the one versus the  
many:  
  
vishwEdEvA ityAha prANA, vai vishwEdevAH prANaiH (tittirIya samhitA  
5-2-2 and 5-4-6)  
  
I am not sure if they cover all dEvas, so in that sense may not mean  
sarva dEvas in the shruti. Doing vaishwadEva hOma (part of pa\~Ncha  
yajna) is daily required of a householder, along with sandhyAvandanA  
and tarpaNa. shrAdDha is the general place where the vishwEdEvas are  
invoked, offerings made, and prayed.  
  
The daily pitr\` yajna and the pAkShika piNda pitr\` yajnas are  
shrAdDhas as much as the annual tithi shrAdDha for the last three  
generations of pitr\`s. The daily pa\~Ncha yajnas involve offerings to  
the vishwEdEvas (agni, sOma, prajApati, yama, marut, dyAvA-prithivI,  
etc.). The annual mahAlaya shrAdDha takes care of all the omissions.  
The nAndi shrAdDhas, while commencing auspicious events, are for  
seeking blessings from the pitr\`s older to the last three generations.  
  
The offerings to the vishwEdEvas in the shrAdDha go hand in hand with  
the offerings to the pitr\`s. They are symbolically given to the  
invited (unrelated and deserved) brAhmaNas (at minimum two –  
vishwEdEvas are invoked in one, Aditya-rudra-vasu-rUpa pitr\`s in the  
other).  
  
vasUnvadanti tu pitr\`nrudrAMshchaiva pitAmahAn  
prapitAmahAMstathAdityAnshrutirEShA sanAtanI (Manusmr\`ti 3-284)  
  
vishwEdEvas appear in a few other rituals as well, such as marriage.  
uttarAShADa nakShatra aDhipati is vishwEdEva. Vedas have many mantras  
addressing the vishwEdEvas. In the taittirIya samhita they appear  
scattered all over (> 50 times).
