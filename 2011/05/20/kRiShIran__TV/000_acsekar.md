I would like to seek the meaning of the word "कृषीरन्" in the  
following shloka 198 from Mayamatam, Chapter 18:

" -----------  
च्येष्ठा विश्चेदेवदेव्यः प्रजानां  
श्रीसौभाग्यारोग्यभोग्यं कृषीरन् "

The English translation given in Page 301 of the book Mayamatam  
(Volume I) published by Indira Gandhi National Centre For the Arts  
is: "-------- Jyestha and all the goddesses bestow upon creatures,  
happiness, well being, absence of passion and health."

I would appreciate your comments.

Regards,

A.Chandrasekar
