Namaste,



 Many thanks to all who responded. Off list, I received this reply from a reader: (I have forwarded the responses to the off-list reader, who also thanks everyone.)



"

The reference to *Tantrasārasaṅgraha was useful*. The other reference that you gave to the *Subhāṣita-ratna-bhāṇdāgāra*, which is available with us in book form, was also useful and we were able to locate the एको वष्टि.. verse (found as commencing with निःस्वो वष्टि...and having minor differences) while going through the तृष्णानिन्दा section of the book (Page 77, verse 50). The index to the book lists the निःस्वो वष्टि verse as having been culled from *Aṣṭaratna* (verse 9).

  

As regards the सन्निन्दा verse, we recently found that it has been referred to by Sri Bodhendra in his work "*Bhagavan-nāmāmṛta-rasodaya*". From his writing, we understand that the verse is from a work "*Bhagavan-nāma-bhūṣaṇa*" authored by Sri Srīdhara Ayyāvāḷ. While the other 15 works of Sri Srīdhara Ayyāvāḷ are available, this particular work is not available to us today."

  



Regards,



sunder``
