Here is some real help. It is एकाक्षरकोश ascribed to पुरुषोत्तमदेव.

This should be really for many of of the words given in your text. And for the rest of the text, you may consult other anekartha-kosha-s and anekartha-varga in common lexicons. It may help, if you cannot get any more manuscripts. A Anekarthamanjari had been edited and published:[](http://shastrapriyah.blogspot.com/2011/02/blog-post.html)

  

अनेकार्थमंजरी और नाममाला, संपा० बलभद्रप्रसाद मिश्र, युनिवर्सिटी आँफ इलाहाबाद स्टडीज, प्र० सं०

  

But the name of author is not given. But it seems to be Hindi lexicon ascribed to Nandadas as it is listed among Hindi works published.

  

Some others

  

Nanarthamanjari

and

  

Nanarthasangaraha of Ajayapala is available in DLI

May be helpful. One more a Anekarthamanjari is also available in DLI.
