Thank you for confirming and conforming to my proposal in my first post in reply to Abhyankar's questions raised. It can be defended if it is बहुव्रीहि like कण्ठेकालः a similar word with adjective, as व्यधिकरण बहुव्रीहि exceptional case, though बहुव्रीहि requires समानाधिकरण i.e. all the compounds in the nominative case, form the compound to denote another thing other than denoted by those in compound. "अनेकमन्यपदार्थे" अनेकम् प्रथमान्तं पदं अन्यपदार्थे समासे प्रविष्टेभ्यः अन्यस्य पदस्यार्थे समस्यन्ते स बहुवीहिः\|उपस्थितप्रथमान्तातिरिक्तेत्यर्थः।

  

The Vartika under the above rule providesसप्तम्युपमानपूर्वपदस्य उत्तरपदलोप श्च वक्तव्यः। कण्ठे स्थितः कालो ऽस्य कण्ठेकलः।

  

But how to explain it in the present case? i.,e. विग्रहवाक्य. युधि - युद्धे स्थितः स्थिरः (प्रतापः) यस्य सः - But it will not qualify युधिष्ठिर himself as स्थिर in the compound is not part of him directly as in the above example, but his valour in the battle.

Though स्थिर is an adjective, it is not like काल denoting colour,

For बहुव्रीहि should denote something other than the words used in the compound to be qualified with all the attributes in it. like either यम्, येन, यस्मै, यस्मात्, यस्य, यस्मिन् - सः in the व्रिग्रहवाक्य . If the compound refers to any of the members in the compound it should either तत्पुरुष, द्वन्द्व, or others. Hence, only possible thing is तत्पुरुष under the rule "संज्ञायाम्" (२,१.४४।) as I have clearly mentioned in my first post. Please check the link to this rule in the above post for further examples.

  

With regards
