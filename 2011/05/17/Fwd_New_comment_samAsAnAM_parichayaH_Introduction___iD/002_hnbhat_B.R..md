Dear Murthy,

  

There is no question whether the compound युधिष्ठिर is right or wrong. I wanted to know how it is derived and by which rule it is governed to form तत्पुरुष compound. Please quote the relevant rule to ascertain whether it is तत्पुरुष or बहुव्रीहि instead of simply commenting it is perfect and right so that it can be confirmed beyond any doubt on the authority of Panini himself.(not anybody else).
