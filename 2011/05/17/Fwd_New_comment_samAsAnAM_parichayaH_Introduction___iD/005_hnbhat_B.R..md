Dear Murthyji and Madam Vimalaji,

  

The question is not that the form morphological sequence or the compound is perfect or imperfect. I have already explained it in relation to Panini's rules effecting the phonetic changes in the compound form. The question is I wanted to know the category of compound with the function of which the compound is formed. I wanted to ascertain it to be explained by the relating Panini's rule which I could not within my knowledge. The question was raised as the classification of it under TatpurusSha was questioned and hence my query what if it is not TatpuruSha, whether it is bahuvrIhi or any other type with the of Paninian rule in support of it.
