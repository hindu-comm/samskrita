My dear friend,

  

It is not a suffix according to Dictionary. or may be whatever appended could be called affix or suffix. In fact it is a participle form of जन् (जा)- (=to appear, originate) derived with the अज्ञान - as a the source of origin . "originated out of ignorance", it means literally.
