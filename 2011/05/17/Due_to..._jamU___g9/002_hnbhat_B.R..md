Can't you guess from the translation that it may be a typo error or devanagari font distortion for अज्ञानजम् - - जमू  :

  

Here is the link to 10.11 verse where it occurs, instead of the reference you have given:

  

<http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/articles/294/1/Bhagavad-Gita-1011/Page1.html>

  

*tesam evanukampartham  
aham ajnana-jam tamah  
nasayamy atma-bhava-stho  
jnana-dipena bhasvata*

"To show them special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance."

Please reproduce it correctly with precise reference whenever you ask questions on any text.
