Namastegentleman

I have a question about how to find this in the dicionary. I have Apte's in paper, and Monier Williams I consult it online.

I'm trying to find the affix (?) जमू which I saw in this word



अज्ञानजमू



I got it from Bhagavad Gita 10.10, Srila Prabhupada's meaning says "due to ignorance", but I wasn't able to see how he got to that meaning. If I would have have to find it myself I coundn't have done it. Could you please help me understand howdo I find this जमू in a dictionary?



Thank you very much.



Daniel
