Even if it is a grammatical archaic usage, it doesn't mean anything as jaTila itself meaning one having jaTA, and again jaTilaM dharatIti jaTilaMdhara \> obsolete construction, like yugaMdhara, etc, taking it granted, it doesn't give the meaning jaTA-dhara as it is already conveyed by the word jaTila. - one having jaTA-s. as in the previous cited Stotra:

  

  

jaTilaM trinetraM - adjective for triNetra.

  

That is why I said, the compound seems to be impossible in anyway to convey the meaning jaTAdhara.
