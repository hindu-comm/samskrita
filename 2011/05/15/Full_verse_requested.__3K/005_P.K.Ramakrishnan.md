Why I was gathering this information was this. Many Years ago -may be 60 years -

my father had told me that according to hisacquaintance who was teaching Sankaraphilosophy for many years he had found only one mistake in Sankaras

language which is जटिलंधराभ्याम् instead of जटाधराभ्याम्. If anyone has come

across this kindly let me know.
