There is also a six volume of SubhAshita collection: MahAsubhAshita-saMgraHa, (in 6 vols.) by Stembach, Ludwig,which covers a large number of SubhAshita-s. SubhAShitaratnabhaNDAgAra is another compilation by Kashinath Sharma with revised edition added some more subhAShita-s. which contains simple proses too separately.  
  

Mostly they are collected from PurAna, itihasa, RAmAyaNa, MahAkAvya-s. and any text in the vast Sanskrit Literature. as given in my first post.
