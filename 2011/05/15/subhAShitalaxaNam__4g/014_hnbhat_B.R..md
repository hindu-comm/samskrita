I am afraid you are misquoting words out of context and demanding explanations of your own. First look into any reliable dictionary and if not satisfied, ask clarifications for the meaning. For the two above words along with some more add to the group, it is treated in Panini's अष्टाध्यायी:

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/2-3-16.html>

  

All the words except अलम् andस्वस्ति, mean the same as नमः, but each used in different contexts.

  

नमो देवेभ्यः। स्वाहा अग्नये। स्वधा पितृभ्यः।

वषट् अग्नये। वषट् इन्द्राय



All are अव्यय-s governing dative case ending with the words with which they are related, like देव, अग्नि, पितृ.

स्वाहा, and वषट् is used in offering oblations to fire to deities while स्वधा is used in offering पिण्ड for the ancestral forefathers (पितृ).

  

स्वाहा is derived if you want etymology, सुष्ठु देवा आहूयन्ते अनेन इति । the mantra by reciting which the deities to whom the oblation in fire is offered are invoked used as as indeclineable. The same in feminine gender, is the name of the wife of अग्नि (ब्रह्मवैवर्तपुराण). It is the name of a Tantric Goddess too in Buddhist Tantra-s otherwise known as तारा and other names.

  

Hope this is enough for the time being.
