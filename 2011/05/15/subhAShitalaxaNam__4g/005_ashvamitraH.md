Yes, pithy, सारभूतम्. I have a nice three volume Sanskrit-Marathi  
compilation that Mr. Kolhatkar probably knows, संस्कृत सुभाषित सरिता.  
In it, there is prose as well as verse, but the length of the  
subhashitas is generally short: in fact, looking at the volume that I  
have at hand, I find nothing but single verses quoted. I am guessing  
that most people think of a subhashita as consisting of a single  
verse.
