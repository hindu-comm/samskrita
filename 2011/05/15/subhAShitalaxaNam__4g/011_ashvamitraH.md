I am quite sure I got the citation wrong due to an error of numeration  
in my source. In the Mahabharata, this verse will certainly be found  
in the Shantiparva, which contains so many verses found in other  
texts.

I suppose that one other criterion of the subhashita must be its  
universality, its quotability in everyday situations. A verse like  
this one would be quoted in a discussion of dharmashastra, but it's  
difficult to imagine anyone using it in the way that accepted  
subhashitas are used, that is, for bringing the ephemeral life of the  
पृथग्जनः into contact with the eternal tradition.
