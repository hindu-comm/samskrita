As it happens, it seems to be a religious code of law, which states explicitly defining the right on the dowry given in marriage. It looks like a verse in VyahArAdhyAya in Yajnavalkya smRti. Not all the verses in epic literature are called सुभाषित-s and in many places of महाभारत you can find many such later additions one of which added विदुरनीति. though throughly full of सुभाषित-s.
