I am told that a verse like this one from Dronaparva:

त्रिसहस्रपरो दायः स्त्रियै देयो धनस्य वै।  
भर्त्रा तच्च धनं दत्तं यथार्हं भोक्तुमर्हति।।

is a subhashita, but to me it seems that the element of सारम् is  
missing here, and that a definition of subhashita that would acccept  
this verse would have to be so undiscriminating as to be almost  
meaningless. A probable majority of the verses of the Shantiparva,  
for example, would thus be defined as subhashitas.
