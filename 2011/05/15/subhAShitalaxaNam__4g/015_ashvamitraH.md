Even though it appears that Mr. Kolhatkar is currently "out of  
station", I might take the opportunity to mention the curious fact  
that he and I have as it were switched cities: he is a Punekar (in the  
residential sense, at least) who has adopted Toronto, and I am a  
Torontonian (in the long-term residential sense) who has adopted Pune  
(and now lives in Bengaluru, but that’s another  
chapter).
