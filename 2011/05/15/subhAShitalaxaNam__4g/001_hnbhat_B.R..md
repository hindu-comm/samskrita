Here is one definition ofसुभाषित found in a commentary on HarShacarita:

  

पुराणेष्वितिहासेषु तथा रामायणादिषु।

वचनं सारभूतं यत् तत् सुभाषितमुच्यते\|\|

purāṇeṣv itihāseṣu tathā rāmāyaṇādiṣu।

vacanaṃ sārabhūtaṃ yat tat subhāṣitam ucyate  

  

It doesn't require any requirement whether it be prose or verse, but only wise sayings found in the literature containing advice or guidance in a agreeable way is needed to become a*subhāṣita* without any restriction of number of verses. Generally they are compiled from different sources, by different compilers. Some times you can find original compilations on different topics like three composed by Bhartrhari.

  

With regards
