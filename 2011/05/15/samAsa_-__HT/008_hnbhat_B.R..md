I just mentioned it is not a technically designed word by PANini. It is usually used in the sense of "usage" in respect of any word. Like शब्दप्रयोगः, अपशब्दप्रयोगः - appropriate for the communication of the intention of the speaker with the words. If they are according to the grammatical rules, they are called साधु शब्दप्रयोगः, otherwise अपशब्द.  
  

यस्तु प्रयुङ्क्ते कुशलो विशेषे शब्दान् यथावद् व्यवहारकाले।

सो ऽनन्तमाप्नोति जयं परत्र वाग्योगविद् दुष्यति चापशब्दैः॥

  

एकः शब्दः सुष्ठु प्रयुक्तः स्वर्गे लोके कामधुग् भवति

  

are the general uses in respect of the usage of words.

  

Without the proximity of "word" it would not mean anything grammatically. When used in respect of word, it gives the meaning as noted by MW.
