A very interesting guidance is the syntactical order given in the end:

  

आदौ कर्तृपदं वाच्यं द्वितीयादिपदं ततः ।

क्त्वातुमुन्ल्यप्च मध्ये कुर्याद्‌ अन्ते क्रियापदम्‌॥

  

Subject + Object + Predication+Verb

कर्तृ + कर्म + क्त्व, तुमुन्, ल्यप् (auxilliary verbs) + क्रिया.

  

in the case complex sentences having Verbal Phrase as the part. English terms are roughly corresponding to the idea expressed in the simple words of the verse. But it makes the general structure of a comprehensible sentence in Sanskrit. It seems the intention of द्वितीयादि seems to convey all the other कारक-s except the subject of the principal predication and it is the same subject (agent) for the  
  

One more point to be noted is that the subject and other kAraka-s in their order placed as above, the adjective to be placed before the corresponding nouns. Otherwise the above guidance is very useful in understanding the sentence structure and in providing the paraphrase अन्वय for the Sanskrit verses.

  

I will try to translate the text with annotations and post it soon for the benefit of other members.

  

Thanks once again for providing the text. Dhaval.
