It has been in use even before I started learning Sanskrit. A small compendium useful for the beginners. It was popular in the primary text books in Kerala and the work too in the traditional learning. All the examples from the Laghu Siddhantakaumudi and popularly cited in grammar texts.

  

Thank you for reproducing it here.
