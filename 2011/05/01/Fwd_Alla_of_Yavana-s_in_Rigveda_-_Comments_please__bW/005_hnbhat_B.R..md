Dear Arvindji,

  

<http://sanskritebooks.wordpress.com/tag/sabdakalpadruma/>

  

I referred to a CD software released by RSVP of the above book presumably. I am not sure. The page was a print out of the entry from the CD book.

I think you can see the details of release. I don't myself have the details.

  

It is the entry in the CD I had attached to my mail I doubt. अल्ला (स्त्री) यवनोपास्यो देवः. in the software.

  

अल्ला, अम्बा, अक्का all are synonyms meaning mother as far as I can remember.
