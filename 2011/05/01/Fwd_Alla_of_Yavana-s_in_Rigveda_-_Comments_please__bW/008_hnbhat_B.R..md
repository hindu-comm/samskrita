Better you can use the pdf files of the Chowkhambha Edition of the book. To my surprise, I could not find the popular epithet of Vishnu - माधव while it lists माधवी, माधवोचितम्।

  

May be data entry errors. I have not looked in the pdf file. Anyhow, it is a good software to search easily any word. It is a strange thing, even if the original book is has missed it. Possibly not.
