That the Buddha is recognized as one of the ten incarnations by Adi Shankara  
has been brought out in this forum earlier too. That is, provided that you  
do not question the authorship of Vishnupadadikesantastotra attributed to  
him. The specific verse is as follows:  
मत्स्यः कूर्मो वराहः नरहरिणपतिर्वामनो जामदग्न्यः  
काकुत्स्थः कम्सघाती मनसिजविजयी यश्च कल्किर्भविष्यन् ।  
विष्णोरंशावतारा भुवनहितकरा धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाः  
पायासुर्मां त एते गुरुतरकरुणाभारखिन्नाशया ये ॥  
In the above मनसिजविजयी refers to Buddha. Sri Sankara is placed around the  
8th century.  
A point was raised whether Sankara would go to the extent of recognizing  
Buddha as an incarnation when he has criticized his philosophy vehemently.  
Great persons respected their opponents even and they are instances galore  
to substantiate this. Srivaishnavas call advaiti's प्रच्छन्नबौद्ध’s!
