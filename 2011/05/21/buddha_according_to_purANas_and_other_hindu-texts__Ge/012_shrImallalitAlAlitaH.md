OK.  
If author was sha\~Nkara himself then it must be according to pramANas. I already said that declaring anyone avatAra without any evidence of shAtra is not business of any vaidika who relies on shAstra and yukti. So, provide me that.  
  
These days people quote sha\~Nkara to prove anything correct. But this doesn't work for all. All are not blind followers of sha\~Nkara. Even sha\~Nkara was not someone with extra organs of perception which we lack. He just propounded everything according to shAstram. So, for these words of sha\~Nkara you must quote purANa-vAkyam.

Commentator of keshAdipAdAnta-stotram ?  
Who is he ?  
What did he presented as evidence to prove that मनसिजविजयी बुद्ध was not different from मायासुतः ?

Sorry, you missed to see amarakoSha and its commentaries. There जिन has come for a बुद्ध different from शाक्यमुनिः .  
Please see माहेश्वरी and commentary of क्षीरस्वामिन् .  
They have presented जिन different from शाक्यमुनि .
