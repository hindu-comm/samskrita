dvaadasha stotram is available at<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/dvAdasha_stotra.pdf>

  

The sixth stotram is dashaavatara and 7th sloka in that mentions buddha-svarupa.

  

as far two buddha evidence, i have only heard stories from my father that the buddha avatara of vishnu is different from gautama buddha, i will ask for textual evidence.
