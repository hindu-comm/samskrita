It is not true for elders as they were seen referring to two buddhas, jina and shAkya-muni.  
It's correct for us, newer ones, as we have yet to decide. Although a few of us heard of difference from our ancestors, we are lacking a huge support.

No. According to us initial references were to jina, the sarvaGYa. Later it expanded to shAkya-muni, as it appears.

Any evidence from purANas, etc. ?

Did laxmI said that she will not be accompanying buddha in form of woman ?  
Again, amoghasiddi-buddha is not shAkyamuni, or he is ?  
  
One more thing, variants of buddha are not accepted by us ? And we never told any amoghasiddhi-buddha as our avatAra ?  
  
Trying to mix shAstras of two different and opposite lineage is not our desired here. We want to decide according to purANa, etc.

Yes. But that buddha was not shAkya-siMha. We refer to avatAra-buddha and bauddha-matam was spread by him. shAkya-siMha was one of this lineage, latest one, as it was seen in la\~NkAvatAra.

Yes.

Actually they had it different from shAkya-siMha. amarakoSha, bhAgavatam and their commentaries are enough to prove it.

Wow !!  
Nice for this new thing. People practicing different things can always amaze you by what they have concealed as jems. :)
