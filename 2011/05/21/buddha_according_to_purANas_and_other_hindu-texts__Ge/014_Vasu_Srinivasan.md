According to Madhvacharya there were definitely two Buddha-s and Gautama Buddha was definitely not avatara of Vishnu.

  

While he was totally against Gautama Buddha, because Veda-s were not pramANa for the latter, Madhvacharya had composed dvAdasha stotram where he mentions Buddha as one of the avataras, but this is not Gautama Buddha.

  

I remember having heard that according to Madhvacharya, there \*was\* a Buddha avatara of Vishnu but I cant recollect all the details.
