What do purANas say about buddha ?  
Someone told in a thread @ advaita-l group that buddha incarnated at time of tripuradAha to deviate asuras from worship of shrI-shiva. If this is according to purANa, then buddha told there is not this popular buddha for sure.  
  
So, a natural question arises :  
Do purANas tell about same buddha who was born about 2500 years ago and whose followers are seen today ?  
  
Please, reply according to the views of purANa and hindu-texts only. I'm not interested in any other version.
