Actually we don't accept awakening of a person against veda. So, we can't bow before them. But, if one of buddhas, who taught against veda, is proved to be an avatAra of viShNu for a special purpose, he becomes our revered on account of our own shAstra.

Yes it matters, really.

If one of followers of buddha told what I'm telling, then it may be adamant. But, I'm not a bauddha. I'm from a lineage which always refuted every person and creed which tried to go against veda.

Actually bowing down to everyone is foolishness. I've no such blindness.

Do not compare both. All gods who are respected by me are faithfuls of veda. This is not the case with all buddhas.

Sure. I don't.
