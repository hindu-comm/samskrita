Thanks for the link.

  

The immediate question will be even though two Buddha-s are proved somehow, as son of Jina and the other one as the son of Gautama, what about our Mahavira Jina?

  

Why he was not at all considered by lexicographers or literary eminent personages? Only they refer to जैन philosophy? All the epithets common to the Mahavira, अर्हत्, जिन, and even बुद्ध.



How to explain this anomaly? Is it a simple confusion of the epithets or two different personages attested in the history? And even Amara, the earliest lexicographer didn't notice that they are applied to the तीर्थंकर in his latest recension महावीर जिन whose philosophy is known as जैन philosophy which is never applied to Buddhist philosophy? Who is the propounder of Buddhist philosophy/logic the Avatara Buddha or Historical Buddha? Series of questions raise immediately. I had already raised the point in my first post itself.
