But when the attribution itself to SriShankara itself is questioned, what about the verse he quotes? For certainty by the time of KSEMENDRA (1006 AD ) mentions the दशावतार-s which is after the Bhagavata. According to Scholars, date of Bhagavata could not be earlier than 9th Century and it is not possible to quote the Dashavatara concept later than Bhagavata. Hence the attribution to Sankara, the authorship of Stotra is always questionable.  
  

Anyhow, for this anamoly, one can pose two Buddha-s one in the PurAna-s is different than the one attested by the history and inscriptions. Again depending on this, Sankara's date too pushed back to 3rd century or so. That is a different thing and questionable always. The question was raised with this issue in mind and not when Buddha was deified or his divinity or human being two separate issues.
