Nice work, sunder ji.  
  
This definitely provides some material for theory of two buddhas.  
  
A brahmachArI brought avatAra-a\~Nka of kalyANa, gItA press and found two essays. One of them based on bhAgavatam depicts buddha of purANa, which was avatAra of viShNu, different from gautama. Another has mixed all things and is unable to say anything about difference.
