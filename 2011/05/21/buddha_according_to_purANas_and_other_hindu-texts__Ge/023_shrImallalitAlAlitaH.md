Correct.  
  
We have put amarakoSha and its commentary as pramANa.  
Now see bhAgavatam :  
ततः कलौ सम्प्रवृत्ते सम्मोहाय सुरद्विषाम् ।  
बुद्धो नाम्नाजनसुतः कीकटेषु भविष्यति ॥  
  
Place of birth of paurANika-buddha is 'kIkaTa' - near gayA.  
His father's name is 'ajana'.  
  
Both are different from popular buddha's.  
  
**Quoting from link sunder ji provided :**  
  
In Lalita Vistara, Ch. 21 page 17, it is described how Gautama Buddha meditated on the same spot as the predecessor Buddha:  
ca dharaNImuNde pUrvabuddhAsanasthaH samartha dhanur gRhItvA zUnya nairAtmavANaiH klezaripuM nihatvA dRStijAlaN ca bhitvA ziva virajamzokAM prApsyate bodhim agryAM  
  
The one seated on the hallowed earth on the previous Buddha’s birthplace, is on the path of voidism and renunciation . With his weapon, the powerful bow, he vanquishes the enemies of distress and illusion. Thus with wisdom he will attain the auspicious state of grieflessness and worldly detachment.  
  
  
  
Lanka-avatara Sutra is a famous and authoritative Buddhist text. From the description of Buddha, which is found in this book it may be firmly concluded that he is not the more recent Sakya Simha or Gautama Buddha. In the beginning of this book we find RAvana, King of Lanka, praying first to the original Vishnu avatar, Buddha and then to the successive future Buddha.
