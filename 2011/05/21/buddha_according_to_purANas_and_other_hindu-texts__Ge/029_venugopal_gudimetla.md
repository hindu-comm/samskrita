Buddhism it self never refuted the existence of many Buddhas before Gautama, after him. When you say a person attained Buddha-hood, you are basically saying the person has completely realized himself and is thus the 'awakened one'. So how does it matter which Buddha you are bowing? you are bowing to an awakened teacher anyways. So to me the point of knowing which Buddha you are bowing and which Buddha is mentioned in the puranas is mote. In Buddhism, Gautama Buddha has a unique place, so do other Buddhas, before him and after him. So getting worked up regarding which Buddha one is bowing to and being adamant that one will bow to only the right one is foolishness. It is like saying among the thousands of Gods., I will bow only the right one. Just my thoughts, You need not agree.
