//Did laxmI said that she will not be accompanying buddha in form of woman ?

  
Again, amoghasiddi-buddha is not shAkyamuni, or he is ?  
  
One more thing, variants of buddha are not accepted by us ? And we never told any amoghasiddhi-buddha as our avatAra ?  
  
Trying to mix shAstras of two different and opposite lineage is not our desired here. We want to decide according to purANa, etc.  

//



I am not mixiing up the Shastra-s. I am just speaking about the cross-reference here.



Maha Lakshmi proclaims,She accompanies Vishnu as Bhagavati Tara/Dhara whenever Vishnu takes the form of "Buddha".



Now what Buddha is MahaLakshmi referring too ?Is itthe Vaidika Buddha?certainly no !



We have to get into Bauddha Mata to clarify this. In Tantra, The Maithuna form of deities are very common (in both Bauddha Tantra &Vaidika Tantra). Bhagavati Tara is a popularBauddha Bodhisattvawho is the considered as the Prajna-Shakti of Buddha Amoghasiddhi. To someone outside Bauddha Mata, without geting into the minor details,they would have just comprehended,"Tara is the Companion of Buddha" fullstop.



When the Authors of Mahalakshmi Tantra wanted to enumarate the companion of Vishnu in each Avatara, they had to get a companion for the Buddha. From an outsider perspective, they would have known "Taraas the Shakti of Buddha". \[ It can be said, they might have known thedifference between thevarious Buddhas - Shakyamuni, Amoghasiddhi, Ratnasambhava orsome other Buddha. They just knew a single entitiy - Buddha\]So, they included Tara in the list of Mahalakshmi's Avatara.



The point to be noted here, the Vaidika-s \[in this Tantra\]went to refer the shakti of buddha from Bauddha Mata.



This Tantra atleast is one of the evidences that Buddha\[s\] referred on by the Vaidika-s was always the Buddha\[s\] venerated by the Bauddha-s.



Now for thatAmarakosha,



Amarasihma was probably a Bauddha himself. The epithets of the Buddha as in the Amarakosha can be explain in terms of Bauddha Mata. Sarvajna, Shad-Abhijna, Sugata, Tathagata, Marajitare allpratyeka Baddha Pada-s. He went one to enumarate the epithets of a common "Buddha", \[All Buddha-sshare the same Characteristics\]and then enumarated various of Epithetsspecific tothe present Bhadra Kalpa Buddha, Shakymuni,



\~\~\~



With respect to Bhagavata differing about the precise details of Shakyamuni, one can but conclude that the authors of Bhagavata were ill-informed about Bauddha Mata.
