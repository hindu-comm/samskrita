Unless there are other forceful factors which lead us to believe that Sankara was not the author of the stotra, it would be incorrect to say that he was not the author just because it does not suit our notion in the matter.

As to मनसिजविजयी referring to Buddha the commentator says so. And Buddha, as conqueror of Manmatha, is brought out often. For example the नादीश्लोक of नागानन्द play.

ध्यानव्याजमुपेत्य चिन्तयसि कामुन्मील्य चक्षुः क्षणैः

पश्यानङ्गशरातुरं जनमिमं त्रातापि नो रक्षसि।

मिथ्याकारुणिकोऽसि निर्घृणतरः त्वत्तः कुतोऽन्यः पुमान्

सेर्ष्यं मारवधूभिरित्यभिहितो बुद्धो जिनः पातु वः॥

It is significant to note Buddha is called JIna also.
