There was already confusion with the use of the word Jina. The lexicon Amara (5th Century AD cir.) refers with this term both Buddha sugata, tathaagata and also a separate Shakyamuni is introduced in a separate assertion.

  

**Jina or Buddha 18  
**

**And Gautamabuddha :**

  

Gautama Buddha 7

  

( १. १. २९)स शाक्यसिंहः सर्वार्थसिद्धः शौद्धोदनिश्च सः

  
( १. १. ३०) गौतमश्चार्कबन्धुश्च मायादेवीसुतश्च सः

  

  

And your question finds place in this context. If we take both of these, the identical person, why the confusion for Amarasimha, himself between Jina = Mahavira, and Buddha. And according to the method followed, शाक्यमुनि etc. goes with Gautama Buddha and the words before it goes with जिन who is called मारजित्.

  

And it is popular in बुद्धचरित of अश्वघोष and पद्यचूडामणि of some other poet, biography of Buddha accounts for in detail his confrontation with काम and his army and his victory over him. Hence your question deserves much more consideration than simply accepting दशावतार incarnation theory which is a later development accomplished around 10th century at the earliest.  

  

Now the question is mixed up with the question why Mahavira was not at all known and even if known, how Amarasimha himself got the confusion between the two names? I do not have a ready solution. Not even a name महावीर popular by the time at least Amara compiled his lexicon?

  

This may warrant the question retaken up by our Arvindji and Murthiji again and confirm your original question whether there are two Buddha-s? apart from Avatara- concept?.
