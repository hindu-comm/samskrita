Cross-reference means : 'A reference at one place in a work to information at another place in the same work(or in the work of same nature)'.  
purANas and bauddha-literature are not of same nature as they are related to Astika and nAstika matam.  
Buddha is common to them, So we must treat them as one ?  
No, Actually it is yet to be proved and we are talking only that here.  

  
purANas were created in dvApara by vyAsa and they were not created after advent of buddha of kali to which they refer. Not to say that bauddha-literature has any thing to do with them. They were created later and they just created their own version taking matter from purANas and converting them suitable to their faith in many cases. So, there is no need of corss-reference, aka mixing.

How came this certainty of negation ?

No. We need not.  
We can cross-refer purANas as bhAgavatam, viShNu, agni, etc.  
No cross reference to later-works of buddha is needed. Cause described above.

Some tell buddha didn't preach, some tell he preached but not against veda, some say he preached against veda. Which is true ?  
In anyway, I've not heard that gautama-buddha created tantras. Who are their creators ? How could they know anything which is not of this world, as previous avatAras of buddha, relation of tArA, etc ? When were these created, before gautama or later ? If before, any proof ?  
purANas say that name of avatAra was buddha and not amoghasiddhi. They can't confuse name. They go to any detail of avatAra, his janma, Ayudha, sahsranAma, etc. How could they miss anything gross like this ?

So, you don't accept they are real talks of mahAlaxmI and indra. Then the whole matter's validity is in doubt ? How could a man know those things which are out of grasp of pramANas ?

Hindu-tantras are older than them. They took tArA from here and went on expanding their literature.

No clear reason provided yet. It fits avatAra-buddha too.

None of commentators said like you. We are far away from amara-siMha by time than commentators and twisting things which seem so straight and clear is not a good thing for people who are doing inquiry.

budhha is said to have born in kIkaTa from ajana or a\~njanA or ajina. So, treat them as dealing with buddha other than shAkya-siMha. Just if it doesn't approve your view you can't say that information conveyed is wrong.  
  
As I said bauddha-books are later creations, there are chances that they were created with ill-will.  
  
I can understand that,  
  
if we treat whole literature as compatible with each other, we may reach your conclusions...  
if we take hindu-literature only, it is difficult to prove oneness of buddha.....  
if we take bauddha-literature only, you may tell us more.......  
  
I think we need to close this thread as nothing more is coming.  
Thanks for participating to all....  
Sorry to vimalA jI for my rough words......
