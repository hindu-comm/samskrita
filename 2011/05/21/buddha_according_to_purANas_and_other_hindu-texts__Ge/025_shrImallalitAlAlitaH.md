जिन means one who has conquered mind, etc. If this is meant by you then any one can be called jina. Why are you trying to find place for mahAvIra in koSha. He may be not very popular and may not have many names. That's why he failed to get place there. I don't think every bodhisattva or older tIrtha\~Nkaras have found any place in koSha. That doesn't mean that they didn't exist.

He may be not so eminent.

Did they say anything about syAdvAda, anekAntavAda, etc. ?

Because both were opposed to veda, varNAshrama, yaGYa, etc.

Actually advaitins used word jaina for bauddha-matam while refuting. If I'm not wrong shrI-harSha did so.  
While answering jainas madhusUdana-saraswatI, etc use word 'Arhata' and not 'jaina'.

purANas tell that avatAra-buddha propounded theory against veda to turn asuras away from veda.  
Quote from the link of sunder ji also says on behalf of la\~NkAvatAra, etc. that gautama-buddha was in same lineage of philosophy developed by avatAra-buddha.  
And, if we accept that gautama was not against veda, as sunil and satish of advaita-l Group try to propagate, then there will be no doubt that philosophy originated from avatAra-buddha.
