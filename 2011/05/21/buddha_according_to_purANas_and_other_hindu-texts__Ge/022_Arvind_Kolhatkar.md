Dear Group,  
  
I do not have anything to say about whether there was only one Buddha  
or two. However, the common belief is the there was only one. This  
much to me is obvious. Now, if someone suspects that the apparently  
obvious is not true and the truth is other than that, Rules of  
Evidence put the onus of producing proof on him and not the other way  
around.  
  
To give a parallel, the common belief is that the earth is round. If  
someone believes in the Flat Earth, it is he who has to produce  
evidence in support of his belief. Otherwise the world goes on,  
secure in its knowledge that the Earth is round.
