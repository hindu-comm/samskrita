Dear Group,  
  
Not sure if this verse is already referenced or discussed,  
  

In the [Bhagavata Purana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana "Bhagavata Purana") Buddha is said to have taken birth to restore the *deva*s to power:

> 
> > tataḥ kalau sampravṛtte sammohāya sura-dviṣām । >
> buddho nāmnāñjana-sutaḥ kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati ॥ >
> 
> > 
> > —srimad-bhagavatam 1.3.24 >
> 

Translation: *Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, for the purpose of confusing the enemies of the devas, \[he\] will become the son of Anjana, Buddha by name, in the Kīkaṭas.  
  
Could anyone state if the translation is correct and if so, who is this Anjana? is he the same as* Śuddhodhana? if so then they could be the same.  
Little more digging tells me that Kikatesu was a province of Gaya which is in present Bihar, not quite Lumbhini but close enough if this is true. [](http://srimadbhagavatam.com/k/kikatesu)
