Dear Group,

श्रीमल्ललितालालितः poses the following question:

\< Do purANas tell about same buddha who was born about 2500 years ago  
and  
whose followers are seen today? \>

Common knowledge does not indicate their being more than one Buddha,  
so, in all probability the bête noir of some of the Puranas would be  
the same and only Buddha that we know of.

The Puranas had an ambivalent approach towards him. The hardliners  
would reject him as a propagator of पाखण्ड, and the soft-liners would  
try to bring him within the fold of the ancient belief. This is  
reflected in the following quote from the website referred to by  
Sunder Hattangadi <http://www.kamakotimandali.com/misc/buddha-purana.html>  
which has the following in it:

\<Agni purANa makes an attempt to associate Buddha - the tathAgata with  
Buddha - a supposed incarnation of nArAyaNa, still holding him in a  
favorable light but at the same time rejecting his teachings.  
According to this purANa, mahAviShNu incarnated as mAyAmoha, the son  
of King shuddhodana and deluded the reborn daityas who, under his  
influence, deserted vaidika dharma and adopted Buddhism. The same  
nArAyaNa is also considered to have assumed the form of arhata,  
misleading the remaining asuras into Arhata dharma. Both these dharmas  
are included in the list of pAShaNDa shAstras enumerated in the kUrma  
purANa: kApAla, vAma, bauddha, Arhata, kApila, pAncharAtra, DAmara,  
nAkula, pAshupata, soma, lA\~Ngala and sAtvata.>

The acceptance of Buddha within the fold of the Ancient religion can  
be said to have been fairly complete by the 11th century. The  
following well-known verse appearing at 15/27 of the  
सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार has been sourced to महानाटकम् of हनूमत्कवि (11th  
century).

यं शैवाः समुपासते शिव इति ब्रह्मेति वेदान्तिनः।  
बौद्धा बुद्ध इति प्रमाणपटवः कर्तेति नैयायिकाः॥  
अर्हन्नित्यथ जैनशासनरताः कर्मेति मीमांसकाः।  
सोऽयं वो विदधातु वाञ्छितफलं त्रैलोक्यनाथो हरिः॥
