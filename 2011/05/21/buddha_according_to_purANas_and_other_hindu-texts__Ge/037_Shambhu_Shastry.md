lalitAlAlita and Vinodh mahOdayAH,

  

Very nice and educational discussion from both of you.

  

If you have (or may kindly write) your respective side of the debate as a research paper, I will greatly appreciate you kindly emailing me a copy (or put on your respective blog and advise the group).

  

This is not for continuing this discussion, but only a request from me. A good research paper addressing the following issues will be valuable for the chronology of several of the Samskrita texts currently grouped around 800 BC - 800 AD but none in the tradition agrees with such chronology. The issues are:

1.  What are the pramANas to say that the purANas (ignoring their later
    revisions or versions) were earlier to Gautama Buddha? Other
    evidences in the purANas or somewhere else are needed to establish
    this. 2.  When was the onset of kali yuga? On what pramANa(s) was this
    decided? Was Varahamihira's 'fixing' of the yugAbda based on what he
    saw as planetary alignment (it really was not) wrong? 3.  Is there a shAstra (other than Varahamihita's) or purANa evidence
    that ties yuga sanDhi to planetary alignments (modern astronomy-wise
    speaking, these have not happened in a million years or so)? 4.  Between a shAstra (such as manusmr\`ti) and a purANa (such as viSNu
    purANa), which is the final pramANa if there is a conflict on the
    same issue? We accept that between shruti and shAstra, shruti is
    final. 5.  What is the pramANa for the difference of a factor of 360 between
    what is plainly stated about the yuga durations in the Manusmr\`ti
    or the purANas and the commentators' explanations (daivI varSha =
    360 earthly varShas)? Where/what is the pramANa for the 360 factor? 6.  What was the time of Gautama Buddha? What is the evidence? Basing it
    on Greek sources is very weak. This too has controversies.

I realize that these issues have little to do with Samskrita per se but crucial to decide the identity of the avatAra budDha as well as lot of other issues of chronology. But then these questions/issues/debates arise because of the difficulties or differences in interpreting the Samskrita texts. Anyone with a flare for words can get away with any line of argument and tell us that our grand parents are our grand children or vice versa -:).

  

BhavadIyaH,

Shambhu
