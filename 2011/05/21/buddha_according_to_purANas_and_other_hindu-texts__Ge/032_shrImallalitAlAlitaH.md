Yes. Correct translation. There are two different readings : अञ्जनासुतः and अजनसुतः . Both are different from mAya and shuddhodana, mother and father of gautama.

Yes. shrIdharaswAmI tells that kIkaTa is gayA. It's near lumbini, but it's not the same. In old times kAshI, a\~Nga, etc. were little provinces. So was kIkaTa. It's different from lumbini.
