How could you say that मनसिजविजयी is for shAkya-muni ?  
Is there any proof that paurANika-buddha was not मनसिजविजयी ?

Sorry, for a vaidika like bhagavatpAda this respect must have come from any evidence from shAstram.  
Respecting opponent as a scholar, artist, etc. is something common for great among us. But, treating someone as avatAra is not just respect and it must come from shAstram.
