I saw. But there is nothing in words about difference.  
You have concluded from refutation of bauddha-matam and praise of buddha that there were two buddhas. But, please take notice that bauddha-matam was refuted and not buddha. So, one can say that there is no need of imagining two buddhas as madhvAchArya is not refuting and praising buddha at same time.
