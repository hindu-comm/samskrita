Dear Group

I do not think the “Two Buddhas” theory is either credible or likely.

They refer to the Gautama Buddha and other sects saw him as a danger, because people were drawn to his doctrine and abandoning the vedic rituals and beliefs.

dvaadasha stotram is available at<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/dvAdasha_stotra.pdf>



The sixth stotram is dashaavatara and 7th sloka in that mentions buddha-svarupa.



as far two buddha evidence, i have only heard stories from my father that the buddha avatara of vishnu is different from gautama buddha, i will ask for textual evidence.
