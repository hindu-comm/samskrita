Bhat Sir,

  

Thanks a lot for the detailed info on 'Purtam'.

I also thank all the others who took part in this discussion. I had posted this query in another forum also and have not got sufficient number of scriptural quotes to prove that our scriptures had considered "charity to the poor" as an obligatory duty for all the 4 varnas.  

  

I can post all these quotes if anyone is interested in them. Please let me know.  



regards  
shankara
