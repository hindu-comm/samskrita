namaste!

  

ishopaniShad \|  verse 1:

  

इशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्चित् जगत्यां जगत् ।

तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्य स्विद् धनम् ॥

  

... Do not go after what is not yours ....

  

This prescribes against hoarding ... This, I believe, is superior to hoarding, and then meting out 'charity'. 

  

When one takes only what is needed, there is plenty left for others, and a smaller of chance of "existence of the poor". We (humanity) has broken these rules, we have extracted from Nature more than what is used, we waste a lot, .... and so, we hoarders (some of whom can give in charity) and and we have 'poor people'.

  

....
