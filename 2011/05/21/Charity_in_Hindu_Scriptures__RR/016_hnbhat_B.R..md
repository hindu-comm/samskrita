There is no word daan in Sanskrit, but only दान (daana). Please quote any authority while discussing any topic on scriptures, than merely passing in guesswork.

  

Please note that scriptures deal with a society where 4 castes were working in complementary to each others at that time, though it became on the inflow of new air, it lost its force. We are discussing from the stand point of our time and without taking the time element and the contemporary society evaluating and judging from our stand point of view which is the main focus of this thread. Even then, I would try to give precise answers from the scriptures.  
  

  

षट्कर्माणि ब्राह्मणस्य -

  

अध्यापनमध्यायनं याजनं यजनं तथा।  
दानं प्रतिग्रहश्चैव षट् कर्माण्यग्रजन्मन:॥ 10। 75॥  

  

according to Manu in the society of his time. Don't take it universal and eternal with your own guessed theories.

  

Please read further verses of Manu in his Chapter.

  
षण्णां तु कर्मणामस्य त्रीणि कर्माणि जीविका।  
याजनाध्यापने चैव विशुद्धाच्च प्रतिग्रहः॥10.76॥

  

Where it is clearly mentioned as the source of income in the second half. Performing sacrifice for others, teaching and accepting दान. How can you say only the alms received by him during *brahmacarya* should be the source of income?

  

10.77a-b/ त्रयो धर्मा निवर्तन्ते ब्राह्मणात् क्षत्रियं प्रति।  
10.77c-d/ अध्यापनं याजनं च तृतीयश्च प्रतिग्रहः॥ C.॥  
  

And, for your second question, the above is the clear answer of Manu (not me):

  

The kings are exepted from the thee, teaching and performing sacrifice for others (याजन) and प्रतिग्रह (accepting दान). In all the examples, they are kings who are legitimately entitled to give दान, अध्ययन, and यजन. The वैश्य-s are also expected to be entitled to these three as the common duties of the त्रैवर्ण्य in addition to their specific duties mentioned. रक्षण for क्षत्रिय, कृषि-वाणिज्य for वैश्य.

  

10.80a वेदाभ्यासो ब्राह्मणस्य क्षत्रियस्य च रक्षणम्।  
10.80c वार्ताकर्मैव वैश्यस्य विशिष्टानि स्वकर्मसु॥ C.॥

  

भगवद्गीता also specifies these वर्णdharma-s.

  

The following line makes the idea of clear:

  

78a-b वैश्यं प्रति तथैवैते निवर्तेरन्निति स्थितिः।  
10.78c-d न तौ प्रति हि तान् धर्मान् मनुराह प्रजापतिः॥

  

"Hence they are not specifically prescribed for them. "

  

  

Hope you would be satisfied with the answer above given by Manu himself. While यागादि कर्म is for all the above three, पूर्त - is common for all the four classes, serving the public providing public facilities.

  

वापीकूपतडागादि देवतायतनानि च।

अन्नप्रदानमारामाः पूर्तमित्यभिधीयते॥

  

This पूर्त is common for all the classes irrespective of their वर्ण and अश्रम धर्म-s. Even women are entitled to do this public service and the 4th class also शूद्र. This system holds good so far as each of them are loyally discharging their duties and responsibilities to the Society in which live as laid by the contemporary rules and regulations which we are now discussing. Hence beyond the frame work, it may not work as a good example. The above includes food and shelter and drinking water supply too for the public. What else charity do a society require if every body followed the above priciple?
