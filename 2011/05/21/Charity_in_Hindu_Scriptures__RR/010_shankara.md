Bhat Sir,

  

Thanks for the detailed reply.  

  

Are different words used to refer to charity given to brahmins and non-brahmins? Does Daanam stand only for charity given to brahmins?

I searched Manu Smriti for info on Purtam. I could find only one verse in chapter 4. Is there any description of Purtam in any of the scriptures?

  

regards  
shankara
