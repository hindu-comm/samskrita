Just to clarify my answer below – I was referring to ethics **for its own sake** (not charity to acquire merit, ie feeding brAhmins, or for leading to better births or to moksha), and also was referring to only Vedic texts – not to puraNas or epics or stories or the dharmastrAtras which focus on caste duty, by and large.
