Dear Shankara mahodaya

There is only one hymn to charity – a dAnastuti. See Rgveda 1.126

Ethics for its own sake is a Western concept. Indic traditions have tied ethics, ie “doing good” to karma and liberation. Even good acts need to be abandoned in the end, because it leads to re-birth. In the idea of “good acts” the ritual acts and caste duties are included, so you are correct in saying that in general the Hindu texts do not prescribe charity to fellow humans.

Modern HindutvA advocates have re-interpreted the word “dharma” to include western ethical norms such as charity, and social justice for all.
