Bhat Sir,

  
Thanks for the informative reply. I did search for such scriptural passages. Still, it is not very easy to find them unless one is familiar with them thoroughly.

  

I found the following verses and subsequent verses in chapter 4 of Manusmriti, prescribing charity as a duty.  

दानधर्मं निषेवेत नित्यमैष्टिकपौर्तिकम् ।  
परितुष्टेन भावेन पात्रमासाद्य शक्तितः ॥4.227



regards  
shankara
