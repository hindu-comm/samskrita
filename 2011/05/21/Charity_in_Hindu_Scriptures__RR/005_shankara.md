Vimalaji,

  

Thanks for the kind reply. It is very useful to me.

What you said may be true regarding Vedic period (I am not sure about it).

But Puranas and Itihasas have stories of compassion. Eg: Story of Rantideva in the Bhagavata and that of the golden mongoose in the Mahabharata. So, we cannot say conclusively that compassion and charity was not valued in Hindu culture.

  

I have heard this prayer of Rantideva (please correct me if I am wrong) -  

न त्वहं कामये राज्यं न स्वर्गं नापुनर्भवम्।  
कामये दुःखतप्तानां प्राणीनामार्तिनाशनम्॥  



regards  
shankara
