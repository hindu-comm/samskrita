Shambu Mahodaya  
What I meant - "ethics for its own sake" refers to doing good and showing kindness towards because of empathy (or because of understanding, sympathy, or love of) with fellow humans. Not because of any other motive where one would get some gain, - be it spiritual, religious, or otherwise, or because of "duty" or because it is prescribed behaviour, or be relieved of sin. In the Western framework this would be regarded as humanism and not necessarily associated with belief in God or any religion.
