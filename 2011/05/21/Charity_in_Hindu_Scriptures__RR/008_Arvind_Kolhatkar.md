Dear Group,  
  
The general allegation, as Shankara puts it in his opening posting,  
that Hindu scriptures do not prescribe charity towards fellow humans,  
is very easily answered by citing myriads of verses and aphorisms that  
extol the virtues of dAna, Athithya, dayA, kShamA etc. These enable  
us to give a facile answer that the scriptures do prescribe charity,  
as indeed could not have been otherwise, since no scripture will  
expressly prohibit charity. The real question to be asked is the  
quality, the extent and the nature of the charity and it is here that  
our scriptures seem to fall short of standards that have lately  
developed in these modern days. At this point some might ask why must  
we at all test the ancient scriptures against the modern standards.  
My answer to it would be that these standards are called modern  
because they have been increasingly emphasized in modern days but they  
are really universal and not confined to a specific space or time.  
Also, a re-examination of dearly-held old beliefs against new  
standards is good for the Society, it may remove some cobwebs.  
  
Judged by these standards it does appear that our ancient society did  
lack compassion towards the downtrodden and the dispossessed. The  
caste system and the Karma theory had such a stranglehold on the  
Indian society that the woes of the lower classes, of women and of  
other dispossessed classes were never noticed or were explained away  
as their own कर्मविपाक, freeing the rest of the society to go about  
their own pursuits without any burden of guilt. What is called in  
modern Dalit literature as the ‘life beyond the village wall’, while  
it undoubtedly existed, has never been noticed in our vast body of  
literature. It is a rare Ekanath of Paithan who would pour water  
into the mouth of an ass dying of thirst on the sandy banks of river  
Godavari. Most others would just look the other way for fear of  
ritual contamination.  
The other thing not much seen in the ancient society was the  
institutionalization of charity. Such charity as was done was at an  
individual level and was entirely voluntary. It was therefore  
transient, short-lived and limited in resources and did not go much  
beyond feeding the hungry (that too of one’s own class) and sheltering  
the indigent. It was not considered the duty of the State or of the  
King or of the rich and the mighty to promote education for all, the  
provide for the health of the ill and to protect the weak from the  
predators in the society.  
  
Two exmples of what may be interpreted as lack of compassion towards  
the down-trodden. We have the famous Valmiki story of how the Sage  
relinquished the aborigine NiShAda to a perpetual low status because  
the latter had hunted down a pair of Krauncha birds engaged in amorous  
activity. We extoll Valmiki as the First Poet, based on this story.  
The same story, looked at from the other side of the divide, can  
have a different interpretation. The same society that extolls  
Valmiki had consigned the NiShAda to his life as a hunter-gatherer and  
the poor NiShAda was just looking for food. Valmiki did not stop to  
ponder why the NiShAda did what he did, and did not offer an  
alternative life-style to the NiShAda. He only cursed him and walked  
away. Showing some consideration for the NiShAda and prefering him  
over the birds would have been a real act of charity.  
  
One more contrarian example. Rama abandons Seeta because a dhobi had  
doubted her chastity. (It is interesting to note that chastity has  
been enjoined only upon Seeta and not upon Rama. Rama too was living  
without his spouse for quite some time. But his एकपत्नीव्रत is taken  
for granted!) Now Rama was fully aware that Seeta was ‘pure’ as he  
had subjected her to अग्निदिव्य prior to accepting her back from  
Lanka. Yet he abandons her because a dhobi suspected her of being  
impure. Was it not his duty to uphold Seeta’s honour by telling his  
subjects of the अग्निदिव्य? It is said about the Kshatriya  
‘आर्तत्राणाय वः शस्त्रं न प्रहर्तुमनागसि’. Rama does nothing of this  
sort. He expediently sacrifices the weak. If Rama, on this set of  
facts, were accused of taking the path of least resistance and of  
populism, would it be wrong?  
  
The social ills of inequality and of casteism were noticed by us in  
any meaningful way only from the 19th century onwards. None had  
seriously applied their mind to these ills in the preceding two  
millennia, despite clear evidence that they were cutting at the very  
root of the system and driving away those who saw no stake in it.  
Even this hemorrhaging did not wake up the ruling classes to remedy  
the social ills. With this set of facts, it is difficult to say that  
charity towards fellow humans was a major part of the Indian society,  
myriads of verses extolling charity notwithstanding.
