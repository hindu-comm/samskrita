Namaste to all,  

  

I found the following slokas from Bhagavata and Vishnu Purana that emphasize the greatness of charity, especially for householders.

  

vidya danam tapah satyam  
dharmasyeti padani ca  
asramams ca yatha-sankhyam  
asrjat saha vrttibhih Bhagavata 3.12.41  

  

vidya: education; danam: charity; tapah: penance; satyam: truth; dharmasya: of religion; iti: thus; padani: four legs; ca: also; asraman: orders of life; ca: also; yatha: as they are; sankhyam: in number; asrjat: created; saha: along with; vrttibhih: by vocations.  

  

TRANSLATION  
Education, charity, penance and truth are said to be the four legs of religion, and to learn this there are four orders of life with different classifications of castes according to vocation. Brahma created all these in systematic order.  

अतिथिर्यस्य भग्नाशो गृहात्प्रतिनिवर्तते।  
स तस्मै दुष्कृतं दत्वा पुण्यमादाय गच्छति॥ वि. पु. ३.११.६६  
  

regards  
shankara
