You can be wrong, if Kalidasa was right in asserting that the river चर्मण्वती was produced by the flow of blood and flesh of the butchering of the cows in sacrifice by Rantideva:

  

आराद्यैनं शरवणभवं देवं उल्लङ्घिताध्वा 

सिद्धद्वन्द्वैर्जलकणभयाद्वीणिभिर्मुक्तमार्गः 

व्यालम्बेथाः सुरभितनयालम्भजां मानयिष्यन्

स्रोतोमूर्त्या भुवि परिणतां रन्तिदेवस्य कीर्तिम् । । १.४८ । ।

  

"यागीया प्राणिहिंसा न हिंसा" is the defending argument of offering even human beings in याग i.e. पुरुषमेध while the श्रुति says "'मा हिंस्यात् सर्वा भूतानि" is the general rule. This may seem to be contradiction, but it is clear in the same corpus of Vedic literature. One cannot conceal it.
