Hello All,

I find it surprising that all the learned men in the group seem to have totally ignored the fact that nearly ALL brahmins were expected to survive ONLY on charity or alms given by people during the time of their brahmacharya.

Is that not charity ?

What about King Shibi - who gave away even his own body to complete his charity ?

What about King Harishchandra - he even completed the oath of charity that he promised in his dreams.

King of Anga- first son of Kunti - Karna was also known as "daanveer" .

  

At end of ashwamedh yagna- a king was expected to give away all his wealth to charity- what was that ?

  

Nearly all buddhist/ Jain / Hindu kings have left the legacy of charity in form of "dharmashalas " or "saraiys" to provide free accomodation to travellers- is that not charity ?

  

Maybe I am ignorant or I am confusing the indian/ hindu concept of "daan" with english concept of charity.

Can some of the learned folks please throw light on this ?

Upendra
