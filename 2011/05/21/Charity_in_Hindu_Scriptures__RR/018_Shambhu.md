The well known Upanishad statements:  
  
shradDhayA dEyam, ashradDhayA adeyam, shriyA dEyam, hriyA dEyam, bhiyA  
dEyam, samvidA dEyam – tiattirIya Upanishad, shIkShAvalli  
Annam bahu kurvIta, tadvratam – taittirIya Upanishad, Bhr\`guvalli  
na kanchana vasatau pratyAchakSItA – taittirIya Upanishad, Bhr\`guvalli  
dAnam tapaH – mahAnArAyaNOpanishad  
….dAnam paraman vadanti…. – mahAnArAyaNOpanishad  
tEna tyaktEna BhunjIthA mA gr\`DhaH kasyasvidDhanam - IshAvAsyOpanishad  
  
Does shruti limit dAnam to one's own community? - shushrUShENyAm  
manuShyEBhyaH. In the gr\`hapravEsha ceremony, dAna-s are given to all  
those who worked on building the house. In general, dAnam is to be  
given to anyone deserving (and rarely to the rich).
