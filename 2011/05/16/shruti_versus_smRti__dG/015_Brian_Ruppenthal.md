Dear Jambunathan, and all,  

  

I found a version on-line of the gItA mahAtmyam portion of thevarAha purANam. It did not include the collection of verses familiarly known as the गीता ध्यानम् -- the one that begins with ॐ पर्थाय प्रतिबोधिताम् ...

  

But maybe there is another version of that purANAm that does contain those verses?

  

Brian
