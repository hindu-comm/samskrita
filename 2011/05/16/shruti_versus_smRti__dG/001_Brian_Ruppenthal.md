Correction:  

  

I meant to write, in the penultimate paragraph:

  

"And in the recitation method, viz., as utterly accurate reproduction, versus the highly fluid oral poetry style of the bard..." with the word 'versus' instead of 'verses.' That would be 'versus,' as in 'as opposed to..."  

  

Sorry! It is so hard to avoid typos, even trying my hardest.
