Most accept the gItA as part of the mahAbhArata, composed by Veda  
Vyasa in the original 24,000-versed BhArata itself. It is not shruti,  
yet reciting the names of the “Rishi, Chandas, dEvatA” along with  
nyAsa and dhyAna shlOka exists in practice. Shri Krishna brings in the  
entire vEda-Upanishad and darshana thoughts (jIva-jagat-Ishvara  
relationships) in the gItA to buttress his advice to Arjuna (to uphold  
Dharma). In this light, it is said to be an Upanishad of all the  
Upanishads. Another (etymology) view is that, in contrast to all other  
smr\`ti works, the gItA is the teaching Arjuna received by “sitting  
down near” the feet of very Bhagawan, hence it is Upanishad for the  
devoted.  
  
The gItA has differing versions although the sapta shatI is quite  
popular, possibly because it was among the prasthAna trayi of Adi  
Shankara (the ten or so mukhya Upanishads + brahmasUtra + gItA).  
Shankara onwards, it has been popularized by all the sampradAyas to  
this day. Swami Gambhirananda (1889-1988) of Ramakrishna Mission had  
mentioned a version with 745 verses (in his translation of Shankara’s  
commentary on the gItA). There may be plenty others with minor  
variations in the verses or words in the verses. Being smr\`ti, such  
changes are permitted.

The smRtis were composed at a much later time when things were written down, (in the epic and classical period) so the imperative to remember everything through chants committed to memory no longer applied. People could read what was written. They did not need to rely on memory So there was no need for these memory decives – such as using a formulaic style, particular Vedic meters. etc.

To give you a partial answer, the traditional recognises the Vedas as “revelations” because they are supposed to be handed down through the oral tradition by the RSis, and that long lineage is given at the end of every upaniSad going right back to Brahma or one of the deities – so it is considered divine in the tradition. No one is supposed to have written it – it is apauruSa (authorless).  However the gItA is a work embedded in a larger work, the MahabhAratha which is supposed to be written by VyAsa (though he may be a mythological figure). Even so, this text (GItA), is considered a sort of honorary shruti because it contains the actual words of kRSNa as quotes. The sUtra literature does not fall into this category, and yogasUtras has an author and anyway I think according to this philosophy it is atheistic”.
