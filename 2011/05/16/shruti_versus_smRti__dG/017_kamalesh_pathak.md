namaste,  
i think - bhagavatGita is not a shruti nor smriti not an upanishad. though there is written as upanishad - it should be due to its status of knowledge and wisdom - and nothing else.  
on other part we can say - Gita uadesh was given by lord Krishna in the betel ground of Kurukshetra and was spoken by face to face - in this sense Gita is smriti grantha.  
though i am much much junior to comment here yet - ??????  
regards;
