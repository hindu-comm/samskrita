Brian mahOdaya,  
  
Wiki articles (opinions) on shruti or smr\`ti are unlikely to find any  
taker among the Indian practitioners of the shruti or the smr\`ti. I  
feel they are quite gross yet may seem interesting from the outside;  
they must be treated as only introductory and not as authoritative.  
  
Memorization is not at all the central feature in either the shruti or  
the smr\`ti. There is no view among the shruti practitioners that the  
“Rishi translated what was heard into something understandable by  
humans”. Traditional view is that the shruti mantras were revealed  
through the uttering of the Rishi in the state of samAdhi. Perfection  
in yOga (yama-niyama through samAdhi) practice is central to shruti  
revelation. The Rishi did not think, brood, ponder, or translate in  
this process; least of all, he did not take a leaf and scribe and  
engage in hieroglyphics. When he came out of the state of samAdhi, he  
did not even know or remember what he uttered. Such is the state of  
samAdhi – he was out of this perceptible world. His disciples sitting  
around heard him and recorded to memory (or into writing) whatever was  
heard – hence the name “shruti”, that which was heard (i.e., not  
mentally composed). Therefore they are unalterable truths and evidence  
for “things” that the eye can’t see or the ear can’t hear. Therefore  
is the immense stress in retaining every heard word as is. Since there  
is no evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the word came  
first and then it’s meaning was devised by the human mind.  
  
This account of mantra revelation is in the book “ChandOdarshana”  
published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. The ancient sages, to preserve  
the Vedas as received, devised the various pAtakramas. Ghana pAta is  
very common among the Veda practitioners even today. Memorization is  
the least of the intent in these techniques, in ancient times through  
today. Although texts now abound, hearing the mantra words from the  
guru and repeating them exactly is critical for their preservation.  
Moreover, some mantra pronunciations are quite difficult to convey  
through mere writing or symbols even now. Hearing is integral in  
learning the words in any language, more so in Samskritam.  
  
In contrast, smr\`ti is the result of thinking, brooding, pondering, or  
analyzing the shruti with the aid of sensory and mental faculties  
(pratyakSha, anumAna, aithihya). Thus, in the strictest sense in the  
Vedic tradition, only the samhita mantras are shruti. Part samAdhi +  
part analysis that came out of shruti - such as the bhrAhmaNas,  
AraNyakas, upanishads - were really smr\`ti. In due course of time,  
these early commentaries of the Vedas that had this mix of samAdhi and  
mental work came to be regarded as shruti too. Today, in the  
tradition, this is what shruti means – the Veda samhitas, brAhmaNas,  
and the AraNyakOpanishads.  
  
The Vedanga sUtra texts, other sUtra (darshana) texts, shAstras,  
BhAshyas/vArtikas, itihAsas, and the purANas – in this order – are the  
smr\`ti texts of decreasing authority. Even the amarakOsha or the  
secular literature (such as Kalidasa’s works) may be treated as smr\`ti  
but of little element of authority, just as science fiction is no  
authority on science. Smr\`tis, being loose in comparison to shruti,  
were/are studied in the traditional gurukulas along with the shruti  
but the intense memorizations (and the various versions) were limited  
to the purAnas, possibly due to their immense size and the desire to  
deliver them through dramas; the lineages of paurAnikas and BhAgawatas  
carried this tradition through public discourses and dramas. This  
“wandering” tradition exist even now (example: yakShagAna); the  
paurANikas/BhAgawatas make free changes/alterations of words as they  
please, with the idea of driving home the point that He alone is the  
final refuge (Ashraya). Simply stated, such word play/change is  
permitted in smr\`ti because it is the product of a human mind and  
therefore is imperfect. It is not permitted in the shruti that is not  
the product of any human mind. This is how shruti was received, and it  
must be transmitted just exactly. The shAkhA-wise changes in the words  
were largely due to natural variations or very authoritative  
personalities - bakaara instead of vakaara, Lakaara instead of  
lakaara, AsatyEna instead of Akr\`ShNena, etc.  
  
Shruti or smr\`ti recitation has little to do with the “community  
status.” Quite often, it may be the same person teaching the shruti as  
stipulated by his guru, and writing his own smr\`ti out of it. Many  
paurAnikas or the BhAgawatas are Vaidikas too. So are the Jyotishis or  
the vayyAkaraNis. We can meet them in India’s villages.
