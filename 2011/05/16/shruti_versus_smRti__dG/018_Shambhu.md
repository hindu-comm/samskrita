namasthE.  
  
Just to clarify in case I have thrown in some confusion:  
  
As Abhyakar ji hinted early on in the thread, traditionally gItA is  
not smr\`ti. It is part of an itihAsa. Almost all commentators agree  
that the revealed samhitA mantras are shruti and the DharmashAstras  
are smr\`ti:  
  
Shrutistu dEvO vijnEyO DharmashAstraM tu vai smr\`tiH  
tE sarvArthEShvamImAMsyE tAbhyAM DharmO hi nirbabhau (Manusmr\`ti 2-10)  
  
What are in between (AraNyakas, Upanishads, brAhmaNas; vEdANgas,  
darshanas –in this order) are in between; in time, the earlier set  
gravitated to the shruti grouping and the latter to the smr\`ti  
grouping. Anything else is anything else (such as itihAsa, purANa,  
BhAShyas/vArtikAs/padDhatis, kAvya, etc.) but not really shruti for  
the traditionalists. But then opinions vary (such as “anything from  
memory is smr\`ti”).  
  
In terms of the process of revelation versus composition, the samhita  
mantras are shruti, rest are all either a mix or smr\`ti in the sense  
that they were composed. In the daily sandhyAvandanA, the four vEdas  
and the itihAsa-purANas are mentioned (itihAsa purANEbhyO namaH,  
etc.). So a widely acceptable opinion would be that the vEdas compiled  
by Veda Vyasa are shruti, the DharmashAstras are smr\`ti, and gItA is  
part of an itihAsa. Tradition holds that the BhArata (jaya) is an  
eyewitness account by Vyasa mahAshaya who was around before the  
kaurava-pandvas were born and lived through the kurukShEtra war. He  
probably passed away soon after. In the later mArkAndEya purANa (where  
a gItA-like sapta shatI - dEvI mAhAtmyam - appears), his disciple  
Jaimini goes to sage Markandeya about the riddles in Vyasa’s Bharata,  
and we only see Shuka and other munis in further narrating the purANas  
to other sages.
