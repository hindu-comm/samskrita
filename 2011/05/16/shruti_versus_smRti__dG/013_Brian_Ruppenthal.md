Dear Arvind, and all,  

  

Thank you for the several superb replies to my question about the gītā, as śruti or smṛti -- Dr. Bhat, Naresh, Vimala, Shambhu.

  

Arvind, you mention and quote the गीतास्तुति , also known as the gītā dhyānam . Do we know where this lovely set of verses comes from? Is it by a known author? Or is it anonymous? 

  

Warmly,

  

Brian
