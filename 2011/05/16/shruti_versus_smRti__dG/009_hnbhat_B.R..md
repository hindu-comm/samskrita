I think this has been replied in some other thread.

महान्‌ शब्दस्य विषय:। सप्तद्वीपा वसुमती त्रयो लोकाश्चत्वारो वेदा: साङ्गा: सरहस्या बहुधा भिन्ना एकशतमध्वर्यो: शाखा: सहस्त्रवर्त्मा सामवेद:। एकविंशतिधा बाह्वृच्यं नवधाथर्वणो वेद:, वाकोवाक्यमितिहास: पुराणं वैद्यकमित्येतावान्‌ शब्दस्य प्रयोगविषय:।

  

Considering the above statement, it is impossible for one to swim through the literature and come to a conclusion that one has not seen any other version.

  

BhagavadGita is considered as a later addition during the three states of development of Mahabharata, originally designed as a ballad of the Kuru family as a direct commentary. This is the opinion of Sri Vaidya author of a Critical study of Mahabharata. There may be different recension of many texts, when even the most authoritative texts have many as noted above. Bhagavadgira compiled as an compendium of Principal Upanishadic philosophy serving as digest of them for easy reference, as the text seems to be. Its inclusion in Mahabharata, itself added weight to its religious significance, otherwise popular as इतिहास.

  

There is no wonder, when यजुर्वेद is available in two recension white and black, though mythological accounts support their existence, (a fact which cannot be ignored), if सनत्सुजातीय is available in two different texts.



Every \\chapter is called योग named differently, as the colophon reflects all the characteristics of Yogashastra, Upanishat, (and Vedanta, *Brahmasutrapadaishcaiva) - each independent topic or Upanishat considered as such -*

  

*भगवद्गीतासु उपनिषत्सु , योगशास्त्रे , .... योगो नाम द्वितीयो ऽध्यायः*

  

Etc. shows its identify from the rest of the Mahabharata. Also the portion of विदुरनीति, is also stands alone in the context in which it is available, like this. These and other portions existing even before the compilation of Mhabharata in its present form, were included convently in the process of evolution from "Jaya" kaavya to Mhaabhaarata.

  

Hope this explains to some extent your query. Some other explanation may be forthcoming from other members.
