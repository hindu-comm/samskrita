Esteemed friends,  

  

I have become interested in श्रुति versus स्मृति , specifically as regards memorization techniques, especially in ancient times.  

  

The reasonably well-researched Wikipedia articles on *Śruti* and *Smṛti *both provide interesting details about specific and highly rigorous memorization methods, employed over millennia, that preserved the Vedas intact.



No mention is made however, even in the *Smṛti* article where it treats of memorization methods, of how the *Smṛti* were memorized and propagated.



Getting to my point here, gradually...



While researching the *Sanatsujātīya* I have found that there are several differing texts of it available. The variability reflects the fact that there are differing written versions of the entire *Mahābhārata* text.



Is it not so that, in olden times and before books were widely available, the epics were recited by wondering bards? And that these bards employed and propagated what we now call oral poetry? Isn’t it also so that, at least in the olden days, prior to books and the reading of the text in public events, any given epic recitation, such as of the *Mahābhārata*, would differ from another on a different occasion, even though recited or performed by the same bard? And I am aware that ‘bard’ is a European term; do please supply the correct term for epic recitation experts in Aryavarta.

  

And now for my main question here, for anyone to ponder who wants to: Wouldn’t a signal difference between *Śruti* and *Smṛti* reside in the memorization technique used? And in the recitation method, viz., as utterly accurate reproduction verses the highly fluid oral poetry style of the bard?



Secondarily, the differences between *Śruti* and *Smṛti* might also reside in the community status and background of the reciter, isn’t that so? And in various logistical details concerning the recitation occasion and setting. Right?  

  

Brian
