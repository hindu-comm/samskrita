Dear Brian,

I shall attempt an answer to your following question, based upon my  
general knowledge. I do not hold myself out as a Geeta scholar.

\< But is the Gita at the level of mantra revelation, do we suppose?  
Otherwise, how do we account for the stability of the Gita text, in  
contrast to, for example, the Sanatsujatiya? And how do we account  
for the colophon term, उपनिषत्सु ? If we agree that the Gita is among  
the Upanishads, how would it  
have landed within the great Smṛti epic? \>

There is no doubt that the Geeta of 700 odd verses that has stabilized  
by now, is a part of the epic Mahabharata, as the following verse from  
गीतास्तुति says:

पार्थाय प्रतिबोधितां भगवता नारायणेन स्वयं  
व्यासेनोद्ग्रथितां पुराणमुनिना मध्ये महाभारतम्।  
लोके सज्जनषट्पदैरहरह: पेपीयमानं मुदा  
भूयाद्भारतपङ्कजं कलिमलप्रध्वंसि नः श्रेयसे॥

This verse credits Vyaasa with the inclusion of Geeta in Mahabharat.

The Mahabharat itself was in the process of composition and  
augmentation over several centuries and, along with it, probably the  
Geeta text too has undergone several stages of augmentation before its  
stabilization into the present compendium of 700 and odd verses. The  
pithy and practical guidance given by Krishna to Arjuna just when the  
two opposing armies, drawn up in battle array, were about to crash  
into each other, could not have been in the form of 700 verses of  
philosophical thought. (That would take several hours! And, of course,  
no scribe was available at hand to take down those verses.) The  
original teaching must have been a few strong words of prose. Those  
who contributed to the creation of Mahabharat in its present form, all  
collectively falling under the name of Vyaasa, must have worked upon  
the original teaching of Krishna to expand it into a collection of 700  
verses. In that process these several composers added their own  
thoughts and philosophies into it and that is why different  
interpreters interpret the teaching of Geeta in different ways. At  
this stage it is not possible to deconstruct Geeta – though some have  
attempted it - and retrace its expansion from a few words of Krishna  
into 700 verses.

Geeta encompasses teachings of several UpaniShads into it. That is  
why the गीतास्तुति has the following verse in it:

सर्वोपनिषदो गावो दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः।  
पार्थो वत्सः सुधीर्भोक्ता दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत्॥

Calling Geeta an UpaniShad should be seen as an expression of  
reverence towards it. It does not literally mean that it was  
initially an UpaniShad and got included later in the Smriti work of  
Mahabharat. The colophon इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूपनिषत्सु  
ब्रह्मविद्यायां योगशास्त्रे श्रीकृष्णार्जुनसंवादे...अध्यायः॥ appearing  
at the end of chapters of Geeta is an expression of the same  
reverence.
