Just to add what Bhat Mahoday said about shruti and smritis. The smRtis were composed at a much later time when things were written down, (in the epic and classical period) so the imperative to remember everything through chants committed to memory no longer applied. People could read what was written. They did not need to rely on memory So there was no need for these memory decives – such as using a formulaic style, particular Vedic meters. etc.



I wrote this response below to a question from Eddie on the YogasUtras:



”I don’t really understand what you mean by “divine nature” of the work. To give you a partial answer, the traditional recognises the Vedas as “revelations” because they are supposed to be handed down through the oral tradition by the RSis, and that long lineage is given at the end of every upaniSad going right back to Brahma or one of the deities – so it is considered divine in the tradition. No one is supposed to have written it – it is apauruSa (authorless). However the gItA is a work embedded in a larger work, the MahabhAratha which is supposed to be written by VyAsa (though he may be a mythological figure). Even so, this text (*GItA)*, is considered a sort of honorary shruti because it contains the actual words of kRSNa as quotes. The sUtra literature does not fall into this category, and yogasUtras has an author and anyway I think according to this philosophy it is atheistic”.
