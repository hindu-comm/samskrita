Esteemed friends,



I find the several replies here to my question about श्रुति versus स्मृति not only informative, but also elevating. Thank you very much. I hope you will indulge another related question.



Is the Bhagavad Gita in its own category?



As for written texts at least, the Gita text seems stable now. So far as I know there is only one version of it. By contrast, I have come across two differing texts for the Sanatsujātīya; and perhaps there are others too?



Further, I notice in the colophon to each Gita chapter, this phrase:



oṃ tatsaditi śrīmad bhagavadgītāsu upaniṣatsu...



This phrase would place the Gita in Śruti, if we follow current classification – and thank you, Shambhu, for identifying the Upanishads as “samAdhi + mental analysis,” and for that reason not quite at the original level of mantra revelation.



But is the Gita at the level of mantra revelation, do we suppose?
Otherwise, how do we account for the stability of the Gita text, in contrast to, for example, the Sanatsujatiya? And how do we account for the colophon term, उपनिषत्सु ? If we agree that the Gita is among the Upanishads, how would it have landed within the great Smṛti epic?
