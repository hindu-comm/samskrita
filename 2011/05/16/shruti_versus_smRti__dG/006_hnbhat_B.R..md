Thank you for replying precisely defining your intention.

  

To reply precisely, it doesn't signal the difference as you have envisaged somehow.

  

"श्रुतिः स्त्री वेद आम्नायः" is are three synonymous words denoting the nature of the Veda texts. श्रुतिः is in the form of sound, which is a phenomenon by itself traditionally considered by MimAmsaka school and eternality of the Veda-s is signaled by the epithet. And in practice, it is transmitted by oral recitation, and I am sure you are referring to the recitation methods. which are called to reinstate the accurate memory of them in the learner and practictioner. They are Eight fold "विकृति"-s to contrast with the original text संहिता-s, I will be separately forwarding you, a discussion on this practice of recitation found in another group of scholars. You can find it in Vikipedia itself some article on the difference of these Eight Type of recitations. I am afraid it will be too lengthy to include it here.

You may note that it is entirely different from the bards singingpanegyrical songs which might be transmitted hereditary, but mostly composed then and there. 

  

And for स्मृति - texts they really signal memorization, but not as you have envisaged. They are religious codes, compiled by different writers at different ages (if historicity is reckoned) probably at different places encoding the religious rites prevalent in those regions. But all of them, are based on the Vedic rites in the scriptures called ब्राह्मण-s and related compilations called as श्रौत rites. During elapse of time, many of therecensions called शाखा-s are lost due to the absence of followers, and the rites are recorded from memory from time to time. And hence the name स्मृति. The rites recorded in these compilations are called स्मार्त rites in contrast with श्रौत rites now available encoded in Sutra-style of literature. श्रौतसूत्र-s otherwise called कल्पसूत्र-s. The Sutra-style literature also have a compendium for domestic users called गृह्यसूत्र-s. These two dwell on the available injunctions in Vedic literature, whereas स्मृति texts deal with mostly drawn from the lost recensions and in simple classical language (but never opposed to the श्रौत -rites. 

  

Hope this has clarified to some extent your queries. I could not offhand quote the authority right now to this effect found in ManusmRti. In spite of my care, sorry the message has become little longer than expected.
