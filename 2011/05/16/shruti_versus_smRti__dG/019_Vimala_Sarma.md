I just would like to add to this to the the thread - the word "upaniSad" has several meanings beside the literal prefix to "sit down close by". It can also mean "secret or esoteric teachings" or "connections", depending on the sense. GItA has teachings about Atman, etc, so in that sense it is an upaniSad as well as being an honorary shruti.
