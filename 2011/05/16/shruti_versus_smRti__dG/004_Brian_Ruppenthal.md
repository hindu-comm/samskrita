Dr. Hari Bhatt, thank you for your reply and request:  

  

""Please pose your question directly without beating around the bush so that  
others can too think in your line and arrive at the conclusion/solution. I  
could not understand what you wanted to know whether the different methods  
of recitation or the difference of Sruti and smRti texts."

  

I will try again.   

  

Clearly,Śruti texts differ from Smṛti.

  

Would a signal difference between Śruti and Smṛti reside in the

memorization technique used? And in the recitation method, viz., as utterly

accurate reproduction verses the highly fluid oral poetry style of the bard?
