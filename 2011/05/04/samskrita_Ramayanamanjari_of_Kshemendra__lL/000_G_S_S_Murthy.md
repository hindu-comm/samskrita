Dear all,  
As I browse through the recently acquired book, "Ramayanamanjari" of Kshemendra, I note the following:  
His narration quite closely follows that of Valmiki Ramayana as has come down to us. However  
1.Balakanda and Ayodhyakanda are merged and form Ayodhyakanda. 2. First sarga of todays Sundarakanda becomes the last section of Kishkindhakanda. 3. After setubandha there is a section which refers to Samudraraja presenting jewelry and armour to Rama.(sloka270-289 of Yuddhakanda)  
Is it possible that he was having a version of Valmiki Ramayana(Kashmir version?) which would have differed from todays Valmiki Ramayana in the above aspects? \[I am aware that there are different recensions of Valmiki Ramayana even today. But I do not know if any existing version has the above peculiarities. I have of course read that Balakanda might have been a later addition to the original. \]  
Perhaps others could throw some light in this matter.  
Regards  
Murthy
