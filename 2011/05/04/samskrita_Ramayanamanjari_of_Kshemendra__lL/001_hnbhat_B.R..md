Dear Murthy,

  

Better you can refer to the Critical Edition of Valmiki Ramayana, by Oriental Library, for the available recensions. And It is highly possible that Kshemendra could have utilized the Kashmiri recension though he might have changed or added some minor incidents by virtue of poetic licence. There is no rule that strictly he should follow the Valmiki Ramayana.

  

He has written another similar abridgement Bharatakathamanjari too.

  

With regards
