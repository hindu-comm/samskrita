Dear Bhat,

Thanks for the valuable info. While it is possible that the poet could have made his own alterations to the story, going by the way he follows Valmiki it is not probable. What I wanted to know was whether there was anything like a Kashmiri version of Valmikiramayan.

I have Bharatamanjari and in fact going through it.Kshemendra's narration is simply grand.

Kind regarrds

Murthy
