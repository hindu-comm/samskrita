Namaste, Cynthia Madam.  
  
I recently visited your site and was very happy to see various sets of Modern Sanskrit Flashcards there. I happened to go through a set "सञ्जय उवाच".  
  
It's indeed commendable to promulgate verses from श्रीमद्भग्वद्गीता. I noticed a word "प्रतियोत्स्यमि", which, in my opinion, should have been "प्रतियोत्स्यामि".  
  
Could this be verified with the help of respected scholars in this group?  
  
Thanks a lot!  
  
Regards,  
  
Aniruddha
