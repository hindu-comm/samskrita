“I am one of those who believe that Sanskrit should be learnt not only to delve into the existing vast writings in Sanskrit but also to promote its usage as a medium of modern communication.  
We need to come up with a standard set of words for denoting artifacts relevant to modern living.  
In fact Internet is an ideal medium for interaction between Sanskrit enthusiasts to arrive at such a set.  
I would like to know the views of others in promoting this idea.”

I have created a set of flash cards for 35 modern Sanskrit words. My husband provided the illustrations for these, to show the meaning without the need for English words.   
  
I selected the words from the *“English Sanskrit Dictionary”* published by Samskrita Bharati as well as a few words from the Chinmaya Mission publication *“Speak Sanskrit in Ten Days”*.  
  
This is available for download from [www.learn-sanskrit.com](http://www.learn-sanskrit.com).   
  
If any of the members of this group would like these in a different format, such as for teaching beginning Sanskrit in a group setting, please let me know.
