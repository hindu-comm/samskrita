It seems to be a similar to denote a - z covering everything generally in a list, topic or subject in colloquial language. As you have noticed it is the last letter in the alphabet after क्ष त्र ज्ञ are also included, and not only क्ष as the last letter in the alphabets list. 

  

Like in the expression "You know a to z of Grammar".
