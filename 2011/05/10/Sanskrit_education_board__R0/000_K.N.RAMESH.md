Dehra Dun, Apr 28 (PTI) Uttarakhand government, which had accorded  
Sanskrit the status of second official language of the state last  
year, has set up a separate Sanskrit education board for giving  
recognition to language schools. Uttarakhand Sanskrit Education Board  
(USEB) would prepare the syllabus and publish books for class I to  
class 12 besides holding examinations and evaluating their  
answer-sheets, said Dr Vachaspati Maithani, Director of Sanskrit  
education. The board would also arrange for training of Acharyas  
(teachers) and Pracharyas (headmasters) of the schools, he said.  
Maithani said a notification to this effect has already been issued by  
the government.
