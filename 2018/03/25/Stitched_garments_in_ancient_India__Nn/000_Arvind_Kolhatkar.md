Dear Group,

  

Can anyone refer me to a reliable source to point how far the art of stitching garments was known and used in old India, prior to the arrival of Islam and use of Islamic practices in the daily lives of the Indian people?

  

The thread and the needle were known to ancient India. Kalidasa refers to these as मणौ वज्रसमुत्कीर्णे सूत्रस्येवास्ति मे गति: \|\| (रघुवंश १.४) and गच्छन्तीनां रमणवसतिं योषितां तत्र नक्तं रुद्धालोके नरपतिपथे सूचिभेद्यैस्तमोभि: \| (मेघदूत पूर्वमेघ ४०). The verbसिव् (४ प), to stitch and derived nouns such as सीवन, सेवन, स्यूति are known. Apte's English-Sanskrit dictionary has 'Tailor' defined as 'सौचिक, सूचिक' and 'Tailors work' as सूचिकर्मन्. Yet, within my limited reading, I have not come across any use of सीवन, सेवन, स्यूति, सौचिक, सूचिक, सूचिकर्मन्.

  

I have come across one clear mention of the craft of garment stitching and that is in वात्स्यायन's कामसूत्र. In the विद्यासमुद्देशप्रकरण, among the 64 arts that a cultured gentleman or lady should study, is the mention of 'सूचीवानकर्माणि' and this is explained by यशोधर (13th c.) in his commentary called जयमङ्गला as 'सूचीवानं त्रिविधं - सीवनम्, ऊतनम्. विरचनम्, तत्राद्यं कञ्चुकादीनाम्, द्वितीयं त्रुटितवस्त्राणाम्, तृतीयं कुथास्तरणादीनाम्". It thus seems that garments likeकञ्चुकी were stitched. In the same list is also mentionedशेखरकापीडन, tying of headgears and chaplets.

  

However, it is not known how wide-spread was the use of stitched garments and what other type of garments were stitched. Were there any upper garments for men like shirts, overcoats, trousers etc.?

  

I shall be happy if someone can point out a reliable source that will answer this query.
