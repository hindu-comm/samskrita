Thanks to all learned members of the Group who promptly responded to my query. I have some books with me that deal with the subject of stitched garments - both for men and women - in Ancient India. I also have a monograph written in English by Dr Moti Chandra titled 'The History of Indian Costume from the 3rd century AD to the end of the 7th century AD'. It was piece that he wrote in Vol 12 (1944) of the Journal of the Society of Oriental Art and I found it in the digitized collection of the Archaeological Survey of India.

  

I also found a good working review of the subject in SA Joglekar's learned work on 'गाथासप्तशती' (in Marathi) from p. 250 onwards..

  

It seems that while stitching clothes was not unknown, yet it was not widely practiced. Women wore कञ्चुकी- especially women of the lower classes such as slaves, servants etc - but women of all classes quite often were bare-breasted. Women of the upper classes sometimes covered themselves withअवगुण्ठन or with ornaments. Exposing breasts was not unusual and was not frowned upon. Men typically did not wear any stitched upper garment, unless they were soldiers going to war or were palace guards etc.
