Respected scholars in the group,  
Sometime ago, I heard in a Linguistics professor 's lecture that goddess Lakshmi is also known as kheerkanya.  
I presumed it must be relating to the samudramanthan of kheerasagar. I tried to google search but I did not find  kheerkanya mentioned as one more name of Lakshmi like Padma etc.  
Would the scholars in the group tell me where I can find the reference to kheerkanya?  
Thanks and regards....Shreyas
