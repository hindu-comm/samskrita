I don't think that the professor was intending to say that the word s'ree is derived from ksheer. His linking of s'ree to kheer probably was limited to the case of s'reekhanD. He could be right to that extent.

  

But the single syllable word s'ree is not derived /derivable from ksheer.

  

This syllable/word like the syllable/word 'om' is a beejaakshara-based mantra and is comparable to beejaakshara based mantras like hree(m). 'm' at the end of these beejaakshara composed mantras is the naada used to end the pronunciatin of the mantra for the purpose of the yogic /breath-based /'neurological' effect. Thus 's'ree' too , as mantra has 'm' in its ending.

  

None of these beejaakshara based mantras has a derivation from any other root. They are roots by themselves. They are primordial syllables 'discovered' not 'invented'.

  

The 'meanings' of such mantras are grasped from the context of their use in the most ancient respected sources.

  

My father used to tell us (he wrote this in some of his works too that are in Telugu) that

  

"अश्वपूर्वां रथमध्यां हस्तिनादप्रबोधिनीं " in s'reesookta is an encrypted way of describing this mantra only.

  

अश्व = श

  

रथ = र

  

हस्तिनाद = ई

  

श in पूर्व; र in मध्य ; ई is for प्रबोध for life i.e., as vowel

  

s' + r + ee
