Paturi Sir,  
You have hit the nail right on its head when yo say

"That's right. But I am curious to know what was the context in Linguistics for this".  
The subject of the lecture was Linguistic Semantics....broadly, how words acquire meanings or how meanings are assigned to words.  
A question was asked by a member of the audience about the word shree. He said while in the words shreemaan, shreedevi, shreepati etc the meaning of shree could be easily understood to mean 'wealth',' prosperity', its meaning in the word shreekhand is not understood.  
The professor said that in the first group of words shree refers to goddess Lakshmi who came out during samudramanthan and that she is also called ksheerkanya. He did not quote the source, which I was trying to find and which now I know from you scholars. The professor said the the word shreekhand. is perhaps (and he emphasized by repeating 'perhaps')
the word ksheerkhand but over time was 'upwardly corrupted' to shreekhand.  
  
But that makes me ask Sir, "what is the etymology of shree"? Could it have come from ksheer?
