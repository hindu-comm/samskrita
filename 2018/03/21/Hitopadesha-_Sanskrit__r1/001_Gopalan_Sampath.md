Well quoted. Thx.

Perhaps in line with the सर्वहिंसा-निवृत्तm it may be noted that- some head sanyaasins (who head the various peeta) defer travelling during "chaturmasya" reason being that is the period when most eggs turn into worms which wander. To avoid hurting them and to aid unhindered movement of tiny species ""chaturmasya vrathm is undertaken where the sanyaasin along with followers stay in one place avoiding travel.
