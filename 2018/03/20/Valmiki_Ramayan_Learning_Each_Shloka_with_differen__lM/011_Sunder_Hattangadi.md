A Hindi book called 'Chhanda Prabhakar' by Jagannath Prasad Bhanu was a standard book on this topic for several decades in North India. So was a Marathi book called 'VrittadarpaNa' by Parashuram Tatya Godbole in the Bombay Province. Both went through dozens of editions. Another well-known old book is 'Sanskrit Prosody Explained' by the Telugu scholar CP Brown. All these are available for free download on [archive.org](http://archive.org).
