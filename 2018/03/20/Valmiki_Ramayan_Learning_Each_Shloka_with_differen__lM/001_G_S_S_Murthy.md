I have 2 comments to make regarding Chandas:

1\. If an otherwise laghu is followed by a samyukta akshara, that laghu is deemed guru.

2\. For anushtup Chandas, aksharagaNa based analysis is not appropriate. Each quarter has to have 8 aksharas and certain other restrictions are to be followed.

Regards,

Murthy
