Request your help for understanding Chandas. Any book that you can suggest for self learning.

  

I am novice in learning Samskrit, trying to make sense of aspects I am going through.  

Reading Valmiki Muni's Ramayan is delight and learning Samskrit through it is pleasure.

Mathematics, Literature is very well woven, I am trying to inculcate habit to trace and understand. Pardon me for errors, but need help in doing it.
