Dear Mr. SK,

  

I have been contending since long that most proper nouns in Sanskrit, even the names of Gods are adjectives than proper nouns. For example

श्रीरामः = श्रीयुतः राति माति च  

-   माति = मर्यादया वर्तते

श्रीकृष्णः = श्रीयुतः च कृष्णः च

-   कृष्णः can also be deciphered as कर्षयति इति कृष्णः

लक्ष्मणः and लक्ष्मी haveलक्ष्म common.

-   One is masculine, the other is feminine.
-   The commonality is in their attending to their respective
    mastersलक्ष्
-   yet keeping their actions within limits connoted by the letterम,
    which I would contend to be standing forमाति = मर्यादया वर्तते

All the one thousand names in विष्णुसहस्रनामस्तोत्रम् are adjectival.

Names of Gods and Goddesses are adjectival, because the devotee wants to sing their praises. Praising is best done by adjectives.
