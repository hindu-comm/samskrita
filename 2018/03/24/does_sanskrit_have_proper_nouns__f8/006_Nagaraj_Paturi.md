There was a thread on

  

वाक्यपदीयम् तथा चर्चाविषयः - Are there any nouns in Sanskrit ?  

  

at<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/samskrita/nouns$20adjectives%7Csort:date/samskrita/dKoMNJmo3XE/QD_HEPwACQAJ>

and at

Sri Sripada-ji responded as:

  

No, स्फोटः is not my subject. The चर्चाविषयः is simple. It focuses on derivation and etymology of words and their use or role in a sentence. When used in a sentence, it seems what is विशेषणम् byetymology becomes नाम and/or vice versa.

  

Though I have not studied वाक्यपदीयम्, it came to mind that thisवाक्यपदीयम् must be dealing in this aspect of the language. Dr. Paturi is explaining it beautifully. I am thankful to him.
