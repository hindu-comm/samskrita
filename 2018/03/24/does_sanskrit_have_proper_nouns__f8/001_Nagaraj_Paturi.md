Sanskrit does have proper nouns.

  

What may give the impression that it does not have is the convention of using synonymous expressions as alternative proper nouns. For example, the Hastinaapura can have alternatives such as Karinagara, Hastinagara etc. Himaadri can be called Tuhinaadri or Himaachala easily.

  

Names like DhritaraashTra rarely have such alternatives.

  

Duryodhana can be Suyodhana. Kauravaagraja is not a proper noun. It is a descriptive word. It can be used as a vocative. But they don't say, "the first son of Gaandhaaree was named as Kauravaagraja", do they?

  

Such synonymous expressions too are conventionally settled. For example, Sri Krishna can be called S'yaama but not Asita.
