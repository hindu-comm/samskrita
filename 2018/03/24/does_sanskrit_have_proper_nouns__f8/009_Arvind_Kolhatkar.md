Apparently to me, this question arises because almost each Sanskrit word can be 'derived' from other words. The so-called proper name 'Gajaanana' of a young boy is a proper name for the boy but can also be broken as 'the one with the face of an elephant'. However, in practice, when we come across a boy called 'Gajaanana ' we think of him only as 'Gajaanana' and not as 'the one with the face of an elephant'. That is what makes Gajaanana in this case a proper noun.

  

My own proper name is 'Aravinda' and its also means 'a lotus'. But when people call me out by my name, they are not calling out for 'a lotus' but a person like themselves who is called'Aravinda'.
