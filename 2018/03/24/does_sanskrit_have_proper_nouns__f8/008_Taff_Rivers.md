S.K.

  

 **Properly defined**, so that all understand what is meant by the term '**proper noun**', which is synonymous with 'proper name'.

  

 '*arbitrarily used* to denote a particular person, place, or thing *without regard to any descriptive meaning the word or phrase may have*'  

  

\- Webster's

  

Thus**Patañjali**,without regard to any descriptive meaning - or Latin capital - is understood to be a certain well known grammarian, and not an anonymous *somebody's*flying cupped hands.

  

Gandhi, - *Hindi for any old grocer,* did not end British rule, by single handedly throwing tomatoes at soldiers!

  

Sanskrit dictionaries add the grammatic abbreviation '*N. of' (Name of)* to such persons *along* with numerous '*discriptive meanings'* otherwise known as*adjectives* - to be duly disregarded.
