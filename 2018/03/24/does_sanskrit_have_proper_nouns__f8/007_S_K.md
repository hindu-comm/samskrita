However, a sutra of Panini is interpreted to denote proper nouns depending on phonetics (regular n versus retorflex n)  
  

According to Panini's AshtadhyAyi (8.4.3),

*pUrvapadAt saMj\~nAyAm agaH*

*  
*

*Some say that  
*

" sUrpanakha is a common noun referring to anyone with long nails. But sUrpa**Na**kha is a proper noun referring only to the sister of rAvana."

  

In this case it is the r that turns n into N - but these interpretations are out there.
