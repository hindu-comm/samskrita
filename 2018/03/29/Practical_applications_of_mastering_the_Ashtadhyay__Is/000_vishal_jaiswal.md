I would like the sanskrit experts to enumerate the practical  
applications strictly related to language acquisition as well as  
fluency with respect to Sanskrit.  
My main interest is laukika sanskrit, (if I have used the correct term  
for general sanskrit).  
When it comes to technical, scientific, religious and philosophical  
domains/treatises, my sole interest is yoga and sankhya darshanas.  
I seek concrete replies as to how or why does mastering the  
ashtadhyayi help me in these goals.  
  
Thanks,  
Vishal
