Dear Sir / Madam,

  

We introduce ourselves as one of the pioneer cultural institutions in Mumbai engaged in the promotion of classical art forms since the last six decades. Kalāsadan was established in the year 1964 by late Guru Shri Mani with the objective of preserving and propagating classical art forms of Bharatanatyam & Carnatic music and the classical language of Sanskrit.

  

Our efforts towards carrying forward Guruji's legacy of revival and propagation of Sanskrit through the medium of classical music and dance has culminated in the creation of the Sanskrit ballet, "*Umā-Parinayam*". With its plot drawn from the Siva Purāṇa and the*Kumārasaṃbhava,*the*Umā-Parinayam*, is a blend of poetic verses and melodious songs in Sanskrit,inspired by the great works like Jayadeva's*Gita Govinda*and*Krsnalīlātarangini*of Sri Narayana Tīrtha,choreographed in the Bharatanatyam style of classical dance. With the support and encouragement of lovers of Sanskrit and fine arts, the ballet was recently staged at the Sri Shanmukhananda Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Auditorium, Mumbai and the auspices of the Shanmukhananda Sabha and was well received by a learned audience.

  

Following the Umā-Pariṇayaṃ we have created yet another dance-ballet of the same genre - 'Śaṅkara-digvijaya' celebrating the glorious life of the great phlosopher and seer- Sri Ādi Śaṅkarācarya, which we propose to stage during this year. We seek your continued support in all our future endavours so as to enable us serve the sacred language and classical art-forms in the years to come. The following are the links of the recently staged Umā-Pariṇayaṃ which we would like to share with your good-selves for your perusal.

  

Yours in the Service of arts,

For Kalasadan,

Sriram Narainswamy,
