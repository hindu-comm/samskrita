Prabha,

  
  
"Pl tell me Sanskrit word for basket."  
  

 You don't say what type of basket, but perhaps

  karaṇḍaka (करण्डक)

   • as, ikā mf. a basket, Kathas. \[254,2\]

  

  is what you are thinking of (transliteration conventions notwithstanding).

  

  

 पिडकः orpiḍaka,is a small boil, or pimple, but that could be a misspelling?

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
