Sunder,

  

The**International Congress of Mathematicians**(**ICM**) is the largest conference for the topic of[mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics").

It meets once every four years, hosted by the[International Mathematical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union "International Mathematical Union")(IMU).

  

India is a member. There was a meeting held in Hyderabad in 2010.

This year it's in Brazil.

  

The reality is that the members of such an esteemed body would need a little persuasion to includethe Anthem of Mathematics in every mathematics school text book in the world.

  

But, they would probable prefer a Greek or Arabic version rather than one in a Sanskrit or Tamil.

  

Let us know how you get on.

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
