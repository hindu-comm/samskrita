I wish somebody compiles 100 or so important shlokas from thousands of Indian mathematical granthas. Translation and/or equivalent mathematical formulas should also be given along with the shlokas. Such a compilation will be very useful for showcasing the Indian mathematics and for those who require a quick introduction to contribution of Indian mathematicians. It may work as a ready reference too. If such a compilation is readily available, many people will invest time to memorize few of these shlokas. It will also demonstrate how great mathematical ideas were so precisely expressed through these Sanskrit shlokas in such a simple manner.
