Mr. Kolhatkar, please tell us your findings anyway. My limited interaction with that book suggests that these are computation techniques rather than mathematical theory in the ordinary sense of the word. I wonder how these techniques would generalise to the type of mathematics needed, say, for astronomical/astrological calculations.
