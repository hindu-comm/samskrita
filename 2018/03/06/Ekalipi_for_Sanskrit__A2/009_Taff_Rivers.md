Manish,

  

A little learning is a dangerous thing.  

  

*Learned*pertains to the mind.

  

It is a product of a system of Indoctrination or Education - or a mixture of both.

  

For most peoples, **Education**has the objective of developing the *powers of reasoning and judgment*, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually *for mature life.*

  

Amongst other things, it teaches people to think for themselves, free from pride, prejudice or bias in general.

Simple Imparted wisdom has its usefulness, as it can save all the hard work that thinking requires.

But human nature being what it is, pride etc. with its attendant distortions of judgement as to best course of action to take in practical terms, can lead preople to bump into things and hurting themselves.

  

The term for such biased imparted wisdom is **Indoctrination**.

From the point of view of the *educator*, it has the objectiveto imbue with a specific partisan or biased belief or point of view - not for the benifit not of the pupisl, but that of the propagator.

  

Which Devanagari?

  

Again, my own eyes tell me that **many***letters, accents*, not to mention numerals (the one and the nine!) are indeed easilyconfused with one another.  

  

The lakṣaṇa of a propaganda exercise lies with the knowledge that it conceals.

It could be due to a fault in the education system, in that it is ignorant of what is simply general knowledge to most. But there again, perhaps not.

  

One man's*education may be*another man's*propoganda*.  

The only way to be tell the difference, is to question the imparted wisdom itself, by oneself.

  

Regards,
