Learned friends,  
  
This is a great idea! Why not use Devanagari as the script for all world languages? Starting with Indian languages. But will all Indians agree to it?  
  
Why I suggest Devanagari:  
  
1.It is phonetic.  
2. It is aesthetically pleasing  
3. It is very easy to write  
4. Its letters, accents, etc. are crystal clear. Cannot be confused with other letters.  
5. Its alphabets are capable of accommodating all the sounds in the world.  
6. I can read and write in the following scripts:  
Devanagari  
Roman  
Gujarati  
Naskh (Arabic)  
Nastaliq (Persian/Urdu)  
  
And no script approaches the perfection, the adaptability or the accommodative qualities of Devanagari.  
  
I think it is a utopian dream to even get all Indians to accept Devanagari as their common script. But so what? Dreams are good to have and better to express. The greatest inventors and artists in the world were all dreamers.
