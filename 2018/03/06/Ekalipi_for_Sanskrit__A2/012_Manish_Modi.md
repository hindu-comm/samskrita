Taff,  
  
I am aware of your bias against the Devanagari script. We have discussed this before, your difficulty with Devanagari, etc.  
  
Your lecture to me is quite uncalled for since I am not the one who raised the issue. I was merely commenting on a thought shared by someone else.  
  
You would do well to heed your own advice.  
  
I have absolutely no interest in indoctrinating anyone for any reason. Nor do I have any interesting in spreading propaganda for Devanagari.  
  
When I wrote about the advantages of the Devanagari, it was not a propaganda excercise. I was merely sharing my views. If you see propaganda where there isn't any, perhaps you are the kind of person who sees conspiracy and subterfuge in everything.  
  
If you feel confused reading Devanagari, you should perhaps practise reading it. It is one of the most easy, reader friendly scripts in the world. Even Devanagari digits are quite distinct from one another. The digits one and nine are quite distinct unless you view them with a prejudiced eye.  
  
Perhaps you should address your mental block regarding Devanagari.  
  
There is nothing else that I wish to add on this subject. As Naresh ji pointed out, this thread has been done to death and 'my script is better than yours discussions' go nowhere.
