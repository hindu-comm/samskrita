Hi All,

  

We are very happy to announce an update to our latest converter for Sanskrit. Please use this link:<http://ekalipi.com/TTISanskrit.html>

  

There will be a few more changes to the screen itself in the near future. If you have any comments or if you would like to recommend any changes, please do let us know.

  

Please watch our videos to learn more about Ekalipi<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPO00-iEJw8>

  

Here is the text below converted to Ekalipi. We currently do have a problem with the "ru" in prithvi since it is a vowel but our parser thinks that it is a consonant (पृथ्वी).. We are currently trying to resolve the issue.
