Murphy,

  

"Please identify whether it is व्ली*vlī*or ब्ली*blī*."

  

Devanagari can be ambiguous.  
  
To me, even as an unlearned one, it reads as a clear 'v'.

  

Also, a perusal of the accompanying text, confirms likewise.

  

In any case, the MW has it that**vlī** and**blī** are simply alternate spellings, as are **bila** and **vila:**

**  
**

  

1\. ba

   • the third letter of the labial class (**often confounded with va)**. \[719,1\]

  

 

vlī

   • (**or blī**; cf. √ vrī), cl, 9. P. (Dhātup. xxxi, 32) vlīnāti, or vlināti (pf. vivlāya Gr.; aor. avlaiṣīt, ib.

   . . .

   \[1043,3\]

  

vila

  • &c. **see bila**. \[984,2\]

  

 Regards,

  

Taff Rivers,
