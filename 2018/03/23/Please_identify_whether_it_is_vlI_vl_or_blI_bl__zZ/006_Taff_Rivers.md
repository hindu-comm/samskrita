murthy,

  

 The publication is admittedly of poor quality.

The type is worn, and the paper so thin, that the text on the reverse is visible throught it - as grey and white characters.

  

There are to my eyes, faint black dots to be made out that indicate a 'b' in your enlarged index entry.

But the type is a strain to read.

  

There must be better text books around.

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
