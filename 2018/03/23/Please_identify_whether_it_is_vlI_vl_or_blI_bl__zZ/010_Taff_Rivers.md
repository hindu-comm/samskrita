murthy,

  

 We are of course, only concerned with the visual appearance on the paper and not pronunciation.

  

As such, I am curious as to what that second character is, in that your scan of the index entry.

  

It doesn't look anything like the 'l' as in theव्ली / ब्ली.

  

Is it some kind of ligature perhaps?

  

In the pic. I see three characters, the first is a half form, the third is a vowel sign, but what is that character in the middle?

  

Knowing what font was used for that text, would help. Has anyone any idea what it is.

  

Thanks,

  

 Taff Rivers
