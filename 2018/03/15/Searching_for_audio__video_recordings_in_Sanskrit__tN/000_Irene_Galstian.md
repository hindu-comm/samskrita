Dear all,  
  

I'm searching for fresh audio/video Sanskrit recordings again.

  

If you have come across lectures in Sanskrit delivered by speakers with good diction and fluent command of Sanskrit, please share. If the topics have to do with literature, art, dance, or spiritual matters, that's even better.  

  

A few months ago some kind soul put on Youtube lectures by Vempati Kutumba Shastry, which are both interesting and enjoyable to listen to. If only there were more such recordings...  

  

News broadcasts are no longer needed, since the Sanskrit news channel supplies enough ongoing material in that format already.  

  

Plays/poetry recitations would be nice to have too, especially classical pieces.

  

Thank you in advance for your suggestions.

  

Irene
