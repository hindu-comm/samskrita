Dear list

  

Some of you may be interested in my short article on Holi in ancient India published on Firstpost yesterday.

  

[http://www.firstpost.com/india/holi-in-ancient-india-from-kama-sutra-to-the-vedas-playing-with-colours-has-always-been-part-of-holi-festivities-4373243.html](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstpost.com%2Findia%2Fholi-in-ancient-india-from-kama-sutra-to-the-vedas-playing-with-colours-has-always-been-part-of-holi-festivities-4373243.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNER0PR-lpZ8fXfSqXypD4pWfTU_bw)  

  

Your comments and feedback are welcome.

  

Please note

1\) My title was "Holi in ancient India", the longer title was chosen by the editors.

2\) My preferred translation of*sveda*(as in the thirteen*sveda*-s in*Charaka Samhita*) is “sweat treatment”. My draft earlier had “steam bath” which I later edited to “sweat treatment”. The editors chose to retain “steam bath” in the para title and “sweat cleanse” in the paragraph.

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
