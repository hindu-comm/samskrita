(like the Rig Vedic "nasatya" for example)

 I find no Sanskrit word 'nasatya', no matter which lexicon I lookup.

What transliteration convention are you using here?

To avoid confusion,please use internationl recognised standardIAST or ISO 15919.

  

Again, I find that Van Biutrenen discussed post Vedic works. And that your 'many coloured lotus' derives from his commentary on the the Bhagavad GÄ«ta.

  

If I may say so, yours are of the nature of a lecture - one-way communication are students are expected to memorise and repeat verbatum at examination time.

Please would you add reasons to justify your opinions, all the better *to foster discussion* and the furtherance of knowledge.

we just have to accept that manyancient words had meanings that are lost to us.

We?

 I have e-mail conversations with an Indian PhD emeritus professorsent by the Indian government to examine some of the numerous ancient manuscripts languishing unread in the archives.

  

  

That we may uncover *more* of the wisdom of the ancients.
