Here, Hajime Nakamuraprovides interpretations of a particular poetic Vedic work from the viewpoints of different grammarians.

  

The poetry compares a lotus bloom, sitting on its stalk with one which has been snapped off.

  

One of those grammarians writes:

The lotus seated on its stalk 'drinks water' and has beauty. Whereas when is snapped off, has the appearance of a monkeys rump.

  

To me, such writings (of Hajime Nakamura) amount to poetic analyses of the kind that was taught in English literature class at my high school.

The same school that had Plato's Republic on the shelf in its library, which I duly read.

  

There is a simple antidote to sophistry that comes naturally, even to small boys.

  

Viz. On reading or hearing such as 'The rest is all fluffy sophistry'
they ask- Is it? ...

... before examinging the work for themselves per the above.

  

Hagiography, is the critical study of the lives of saints.

No saints come into the picture, only grammarians.
