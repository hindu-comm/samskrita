Skpflex1,  
  
I am not defending the strength of Unadi sutras. The criticism of Unadi sutras that you have mentioned are well-known. It is common to treat these derivations with a grain of salt. And by the way, the stated IE origin hardly stands on firm ground. For example, [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com) gives the following word origin for ape:  

Old English apa "ape, monkey," from Proto-Germanic \*apan (cf. Old Saxon apo, Old Norse api, Dutch aap, German affe), perhaps borrowed in Proto-Germanic from Celtic (cf. Old Irish apa) or Slavic (cf. Old Bohemian op, Slovak opitza), perhaps ultimately from a non-Indo-European language.

No "ka" in the above word origin - and it hypothesizes a non IE origin. Go figure.
