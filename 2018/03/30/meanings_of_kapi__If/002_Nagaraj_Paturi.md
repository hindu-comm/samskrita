Etymology of the synonym for Surya viz., 'ravi' is also given in the form of a coding in the syllables 'ra' and 'vi' only.

  

For that matter there are many other words such as guru which are given in the form of a coding in the syllables.

  

Giving etymologies of that kind is as old as braamhaNas.

  

Such etymologies may not stand the strict scrutiny of historical or derivational procedures.

  

Sometimes you may be able to find plausible etymologies without resorting to syllablewise decoding as in the case of guru.

  

But such etymologies may not be available for all Sanskrit words connecting them to their denotational or connotational meanings.

  

Connotations may develop through semantic change, metaphor etc.
