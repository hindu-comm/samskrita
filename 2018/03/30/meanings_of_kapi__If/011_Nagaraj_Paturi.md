All words of 'Dravidian' languages are given a 'Dravidian' origin. That does not mean that that word does not belong to that specific language where it is found used. It may just mean that the rules found in the available grammars of the specific language are not sufficient to explain the origin of the word.

  

Similarly, a Sanskrit word having an 'Indo-european' etymology does not mean that that word is not a Sanskrit word. It just means that the rules in ashTaadhyaayii are not sufficient to explain the origin of the word.

  

The word pani = work is found in Telugu as a noun. Telugu grammar just takes it as a word that does not need a derivation from any other word or word-part.

  

But Tamil has the verb paN.

  

This knowledge of Tamil may help us understand that the Telugu could have had its origin in the root paN, that is found in Telugu today.

  

Tamil does not have the noun form of pan such as pani.

  

Similarly there are Tamil nouns whose verb roots are found in Telugu and the noun form is not fond in Telugu.

  

Tamil grammars might have treated that noun as underivable. But knowledge of Telugu might help in tracing the root of the same.

  

  

'Ind-european' etymology of the word 'kapi' could be a similar case.
