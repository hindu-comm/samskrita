S.K.

  

MW is concerned with the etymology of Classic Sanskrit words.

Whereas the etymology of kaṃ pibati, derives from the Vedic lexicons.

  

For an extensive scholarly interpretation of the diverse schools of thought one can do worse that to take a look to the works of Hajime Nakamura.

  

His analysis of kaṃ pibati occurs on page 97 of his History of Early Vedanta Philosophy (Part 2) – January 8, 2004.

An English translation (with original Devanagari), published by Motilal Banarsidass.

  

He provides the source of many controversies stemming from the the various schools which he discusses at length - the nature of 'words' as conventional v authorised etc. is but one.

  

An earlier edition of his complete work, but lacking the Devanagari is available as a free download form some sites, but beware that is in excess of 165Mbs.
