Monier Willians's dictionary says:  
  
कपि *kapi, is, is, i* (said to be fr. rt. *kamp*),  
brown; (*is*), m. an ape or monkey; an elephant;  
the plant Emblica Officinalis or a species of Karañja;  
incense, storax or impure benzoin, \[cf. *kapi-ja,*  
*kapi-taila,* &c.\]; the sun; an epithet of Viṣṇu or  
Kṛṣṇa; N. of a Muni, the author of a Vedic verse,  
son of Uru-kṣaya; (*is* or *ī*), f. a female ape or  
monkey; \[cf. Gr. κῆπος, κεῖπος; Old Germ. affo;  
Angl. Sax. apa; Eng. ape.\]  
  
  
*The etymology "kam* (water) *pibati* (drinks)" for the sun doesn't seem to be correct. The ending for "drinker of" is "pa" and not "pi" like in somapa - drinker of Soma for Indra.  
How is "kapi" an epithet of Krishna or Vishnu? Has the Sun been called "kapi" in attested usage?
