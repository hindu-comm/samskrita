an Van Buitenen has "many colored lotus". Apparently the verbal gymnastics with this compound word has infinite varieties. Unless this word occurs somewhere else - all other interpretations except "monkey's behind" are just fanciful. We have lost the Sandhi splits of many ancient words (like the Rig Vedic "nasatya" for example) and we just have to accept that manyancient words had meanings that are lost to us.
