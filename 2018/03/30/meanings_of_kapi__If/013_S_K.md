We don't even know if the original is "kapyasam" because except for Rig Veda and so forth we don't know how well the originals were preserved. If it is - "Monkey's behind" is undoubtedly correct - vulgar or not. The rest is all fluffy sophistry - might have even be added by later vaishnavites as part of the hagiography of ramanuja.
