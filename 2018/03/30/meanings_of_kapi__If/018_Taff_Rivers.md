hn bhat,

  

 Thank you Dr.

  

I qualified my 'find no Sanskrit' with two statements, for a reason:

  

==>  

I find no Sanskrit word 'nasatya', no matter which lexicon I lookup.

What transliteration convention are you using here?

To avoid confusion,please use internationl recognised standardIAST or ISO 15919.

\<==

  

Yes, there is a 'nāsatya' entry in the lexicons. Of course there is.

But the word under discussion is 'nasatya', not 'nāsatya'.

  

नासत्यौ¦, पुं, (नास्ति असत्यं ययोस्तौ । “नभ्राण्-

(nāsatyau¦, puṃ, (nāsti asatyaṃ yayostau \| “nabhrāṇ- )

 . . .

  

On my behalf, I should have made it clear that my 'Sanskrit' is the Anglicised loan word as found not only in the MW. but also in such as Webster's:



MW:

  • Pass.p. aśyamāna, AV. xii, 5, 38) to eat, consume (with acc.; \[this only in classical *Sanskrit*\] or gen.), ṚV. &c.  

  

Webster's:

*  Sanskrit*, n.

    1. an Indo-European, Indic language, in use since c1200 [B.C.as](http://B.C.as) the religious and classical literary language of India. Abbr.: Skt

  

So gentlemen, the question remains:- is it *a fact* that there is no'nasatya'?
