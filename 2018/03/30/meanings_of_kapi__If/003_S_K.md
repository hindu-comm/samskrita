An etymology for "guru" purely within Sanskrit is problematic since it has indo-european cognates  
  
\[cf. Gr. βαρύς;  
Lat. gravis; Goth. kauriths; Lith. giéras.\]  
  
similarly, kapi as monkey is likely from proto indo european

  
  
\[cf. Gr. κῆπος, κεῖπος; Old Germ. affo;  
Angl. Sax. apa; Eng. ape.\]  
  

monosyllabic and disyllabic words need not have derivation from simpler elements.  
  
My concern is with "kapi" analyzed as "kam pibati" - it doesn't seem correct - the verb is pa - and indra as "drinker of soma" is "somapa".
Is there an attested instance where the sun is called "kapi"?
