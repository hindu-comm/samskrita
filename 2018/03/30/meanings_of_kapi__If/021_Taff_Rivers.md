SK,  
  
  
 Please use conventional spelling.

  

  arya is neither English nor Sanskrit.

  

There is the English Aryan, in the sense Indo-European. Note the capital letter.

There is the Sanskrit, ārya, which means 'of high rank'.  Note the diacritic.

  

Both have unpleasant conotations.

  

I'm sure we are all conversant with the pronuncation of the Sanskrit alphabet and its pairs of long and short vowels in speech (along with a triple length in metrical utterances).

  

But written Sanskrit, whatever the lipi needs to specific and to convey sound by indirect means, however lotus-like beautiful or monkeys-bottom like ugly.

  

The light of the Sun illuminates both.

  

Be a light unto us all, like the Sun, personified as Viṣṇu in the Vedic, that reveals all, and hides not.

  

Remenbering that hiṃsā is of three kinds, as is a-hiṃsā. Even so, all such dwell but in the manas. iti, Guru Taff.
