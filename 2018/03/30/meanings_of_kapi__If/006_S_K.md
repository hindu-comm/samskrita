This is what Wiki says about "Unadi sutras"  
  
"The **Unadi-Sutras** (Sanskrit उणादि-सूत्र *uṇādi-sūtra-*) are a group of texts in Indian grammatical tradition ([Vyākaraṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vy%C4%81kara%E1%B9%87a "Vyākaraṇa")). They form an accessory to the *[Aṣṭādhyāyī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%AD%C4%81dhy%C4%81y%C4%AB "Aṣṭādhyāyī")* ("Eight Chapters", the grammar of [Pāṇini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini "Pāṇini")). They deal with Sanskrit affixes. They propose to validate the view attributed to [Śākaṭāyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81ka%E1%B9%AD%C4%81yana "Śākaṭāyana") that all [words can be analysed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_formation "Word formation") by the addition of [affixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix") to verbal roots. As a consequence, the notion of "affix" for the purposes of the Unadi-Sutras is extremely loose and not necessarily etymological; the classical grammarians (such as [Patañjali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali "Patañjali") ) were aware that this means of derivation was purely formal and in many cases had no relation to the word's actual meaning.^("  
  
I understand that the suffix for "drinker of" is "pa" according to Panini. If so-called unadi-sutras allow "pi" also that just makes the language too loose and all kinds of utterly fanciful etymologies can be derived. Is there an examples of a word that looks like \<stem>pi that means "drinker of \<stem>" where \<stem> is a proper word and not a single letters like "ka" that has been given all kinds of meanings.  
  
The only way for "kapi" in the sense of "monkey" to have an etymology within Sanskrit, given the cognates in other Indo-European languages is for Sanskrit to be proto-indo-european and absolutely no scholar thinks that.
