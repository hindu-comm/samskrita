Dear Sir,

  

Even I was having the same question. The gender for nouns denoting living beings can be justified. How to justify the gender of non-living entities and abstract nouns. How to know the gender of abstract nouns? I need to look in the dictionary. What if I do not have dictionary? My learning comes to a pause or halt.

  

This is further complicated in Sanskrit by adjectives having gender..

  

In English, if I want to use the adjective "beautiful" , I need not concern about the gender of noun being qualified (beautiful Rama/Sita/John./Marry).

But in Sanskrit , if I want to use adjective "beautiful", I should first know whether the noun being qualified is masculine, feminine or neuter and I need to change the form of "beautiful" accordingly. Does it seem complicated at least from the point of learning?

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
