Sri RamanaMurthy Bathala-ji,

  

Please see the gender in German here:

  

<https://www.lsa.umich.edu/german/hmr/Grammatik/Gender/Gender.html>  

  

Do you see that non-living things have masculine and feminine gender?

  

Do you see that masculine and feminine genders are decided on the basis of word-endings?

  

Do you see why someone had to provide "Some Hints on How to Guess Gender" for German?

  

Do you know that Latin too has gender for adjective and in Latin too gender of the adjective has to be the same as the gender of the qualified noun.

  

Do you know French too retains some of such features of Latin , its ancient version?
