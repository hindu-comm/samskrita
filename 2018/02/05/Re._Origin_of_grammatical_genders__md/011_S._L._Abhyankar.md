Dear Mr. Taff Rivers !

  

We learn from each other. We cannot do that if we get into enmity. Having interpreted your query in various ways, I still left my interpretations open for you to comment. Hence the closing sentence of my post was "I hope, such interpretation of his query by me is proper."

  

Now, many thanks to Mr. श्रीकण्ठ for presenting the PDF "OnGender" "From the book Bhartrhari by K.A.Subramania Iyer, published by Deccan College Pune, 1992." On Page 3/12 I read an interesting question "... is gender शब्दधर्म or वस्तुधर्म ? ...".

  

I get to think that grammatical gender isशब्दधर्म, especially in Sanskrit. For example, for the English meaning of "conduct, behaviour", one gets two abstract nouns वृत्तिः and वर्तनम्from one and the same dhaatu वृत्. Of course derivations ofवृत्तिः and वर्तनम् are different and that exactly causes their genders being different. The derivations being different makes their grammatical gender, eminently aशब्दधर्म.

  

Why should Sanskrit as a language provide for two nearly synonymous abstract nouns to be derived from one and the same dhaatu ? I think different derivations provide for different scope of applications. For example one extended meaning ofवृत्तिःis profession or occupation. Such meaning is not in the scope ofवर्तनम्. Wider scope of application is the characteristics of the feminist suffix ति. This suffix seems to provide not only wider scope of application, but stronger strength of the characteristics, which is inherent in many feminine abstract nouns such as भक्ति, शक्ति, बुद्धि,inदेवीसूक्तम् - a typical quote "या देवी सर्वभूतेषु शक्तिरूपेण संस्थिता, नमस्तस्यै, नमस्तस्यै, नमस्तस्यै, नमो नमः"

  

Often I get to also think that most nouns in Sanskrit are adjectival than nominal. As has been sighted in that PDF, one is left askance, "how can there be a neuter noun कलत्रम् to mean "wife" ?". I think neuter gender of this wordकलत्रम्is also aशब्दधर्म. I think it is derived from dhaatu कल् and suffix त्र. This suffix त्र helps to get common nouns meaning "tool for the action implicit in the meaning of the dhaatu. For example

शस्त्रम् is the tool for the action शस् / शंस्to cut. By such derivation a knife is as much aशस्त्रम्as is a sword.

अस्त्रम् is the tool for the action अस् / अंस्to hurt by throwing. By such derivation a spear is as much anअस्त्रम्as is an arrow.

In like manner कलत्रम् is the tool for the actionकल्to make inclined, to decline, to disturb the (mental or physical) balance. An incline on a road is as much aकलत्रम्, as is an enticing beauty.

1.  कलत्रम्= wife is only an extended meaning ofकलत्रम्.
2.  Basically howकलत्रम्has come to be a common noun, is only by
    itsशब्दधर्म of use of the suffixत्र, which suffix lends neuter
    gender to common nouns formed with it.

I guess, this hypothesis, that grammatical gender is aशब्दधर्म can help to set at rest many doubts.
