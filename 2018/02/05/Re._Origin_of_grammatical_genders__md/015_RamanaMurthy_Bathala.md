Dear Nagaraj Sir,

  

Pranams. At the outset, I requestyou to pardon me for writing the lengthy reply With due respect, I would like to say that I have no harsh feeling towards Sanskrit. I only expressed my frustration towards difficulty in Sanskrit learning. As as a student, I am facing difficulty in getting the proficiency in the language.



A few years back, I joined for Introductory Sanskrit classes in Ramakrishna Math, Hyderabad.After the class session is over, bell used to ring indicating the end of the session. I want to ask the question "Who is ringing the bell?" in Sanskrit. Teacher told me to use "कः kaḥ" in case the bell is rung by male and "का kā" in case it is rung by female. How, on the earth, I know the male of female is ringing the bell outside, sitting in the class? The sound of the bell is same whether it is rung by male or female. So there is no scope of knowing the gender. Without knowing the gender I can not frame a question in Sanskrit. English says “You don’t need to bother about the gender. Just use the question word “who”. It will serve purpose.” But Sanskrit says “First decide whether it is कः kaḥ or का kā . Then only you can frame the question.” This is one of the times I got frustration while learning the Sanskrit. Finally, teacher told me, in case the gender is not known, use the masculine gender कः kaḥ. This is allowed in Sanskrit grammar. Clearly there is an element of gender bias if I use the word कः kaḥ in the question. First of tell me sir, why I need to invoke gender, if my purpose is to know the name, not the gender, of the person ringing the bell? The use of कः kaḥ is not acceptable to the modern FEMINISTS.

Long back, I used to read the words like “chairman” in the news paper. Probably someone might have arguedwhy not “chair woman?” because women also occupying that position. Then finally ended with the word “chairperson” being used in the media. What I mean to say here is that English has adapteditself to the gender-neutral environment of the contemporary world. My question is whether Sanskrit has that much flexibilityto the changing world, the contemporary world? Can it adapt itself to the changing world? Can it fit in the modern world of twitter, sms, chat, Whatsapp where brevity is the rule, rather than the grammar?

Coming back to the original point of difficulty in learning Sanskrit, it is if equally by both teachers / authors and students alike. I am bring to you two such instances. This difficulty is especially in case of verbs.

1) A GUIDE TO SANSKRIT VERBS PARTS FIRST AND SECOND BY GOVIND SHANKAR SHASTRI BAPAT. Extract from the Preface of the book:

"INFLEXION of verbs in Sanskrit is so peculiarly difficult, that it mocks all attempts to master it. Rules, however judiciously framed, sit so loose upon them, that one finds himself often at a loss."

2) A HIGHER SANSKRIT GRAMMAR- MR KALE . Extract from the Preface of the book:

"But a special feature of the present Grammar is the chapter on the 'Conjugation of Verbs.' No part of Sanskrit Grammar is more difficult and perplexing and therefore more calculated, to tire out the patience of the young student, than the conjugation of Verbs."

If you look at the tone and tenor of the authors, it clearly says Sanskritgrammar, especially verbs” is not easy to learn.

Ramana murthy
