Dear Sri RamanaMurthy Bathala -ji,

  

The authors quoted by you are speaking from an English learning background just as you are.

  

The 'ease' or 'difficulty' in learning a second language (any language learnt after acquiring the mother tongue ) is a matter of perception.

  

I showed you the gender situation in German. Aren't people learning that language?

  

I showed you how in Latin the Sanskrit-like situation exists with regard to the gender, number etc. of the adjective being the same as that/those of the noun qualified by it. Didn't people learn

that language?

  

People who speak German, or who spoke Sanskrit or Latin were human beings. Features of those languages are /were born from their collective unconscious convention.

In nature languages are spoken by human beings. Anything to be 'natural' for languages has to come from their speakers who are part of nature. So grammar of any language which is

nothing but the collective convention unconsciously created and agreed upon collectively by its speakers, is 'natural' . Looking at grammar of one kind of language as natural and that

of others as unnatural is all a product of subjective prejudices.
