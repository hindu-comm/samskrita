Grammatical gender is a concept, the way it prevails in the speakers of the particular language. Origin of grammatical gender has to be hence checked in the way the particular language evolved and not in the grammar of that language.

  

As such, in the context of grammatical gender, Sanskrit is simpler than many Indian languages, since in Sanskrit the verb-form does not change with change of gender of the subject-word. But in many Indian languages, the verb-form changes, if the gender of subject-word changes. For example,

-   in Marathi Raama jaato \[Raama (masculine) goes\]; Ramaa jaatey
    \[Ramaa (feminine) goes\].
-   It is so in HIndi also Raama jaataa hai; Ramaa jaatee hai.  
-   In English the verb is common, "goes", regardless of whether the
    subject is Raama or Ramaa.

The basic fact to be borne in mind is that grammarians of any particular language are never the creators of that language. They try to prepare a framework of rules, by deciphering the styles of speech, prevalent in the particular language. That framework of rules then becomes the grammar of that language. Neither the grammar nor the grammarians would ever be able to explain why in many Indian languages the verb changes with the change in the grammatical gender of the subject word. If it has been so, it has been so; period.
