From the post by Mr. Taff Rivers, What I gathered was that, concept of gender is an avoidable complication. So, I read his query to be in the title of the thread, "Origin of Grammatical gender". I further deduced, whether he was suggesting that the origin needs to be searched in the grammar of the languages.

  

Now, thinking further, it comes to mind that this new thread is somewhat of an extension of his other thread about पञ्चतय्यः. There, in understanding the derivation ofपञ्चतय्यः, it proceeds asपञ्च =>पञ्चतय => पञ्चतयी =>पञ्चतय्यः Since bothपञ्चतय and पञ्चतयी are adjectival would translate as "five-fold", it seems, by his line of thinking "पञ्चतय => पञ्चतयी" is an avoidable complication. So, his query "Where-from did this concept of grammatical gender originate ?"

  

We know that in the योगसूत्रम् "वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः ...(1'5) the adjective पञ्चतय्यः qualifies the noun वृत्तयः / Since that noun is feminine, the adjective also has to be feminine. But his query can then be considered to be "Why is the noun वृत्ति feminine ? Why should a noun such as वृत्ति have a grammatical gender ?" I may further extend his query to be "Why should common nouns have gender ?" He may grant that personal nouns would have and would need to have genders. But why common nouns and abstract nouns ?"

  

I hope, such interpretation of his query by me is proper.
