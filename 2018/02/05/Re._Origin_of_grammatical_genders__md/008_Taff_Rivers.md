Goodness gracious me!

  

I'm getting a growing suspition that something got lost in the translation, way, way back.

Gender! The descriptions relate entirely to temporal aspects of the substantive in question, the labels express the three temporal periods of change,

Gender, in either its biological or grammatical senses, simply, doesn't come into it.

  

Presented with Bhartṛhari's devanagari descriptions of the three things, for the very first time, there is no way that I would give them the English names, masculine, feminine or neuter.

⦁  the (feminine!) becoming increasingly prominent, appearing from nowhere phase,

⦁  the (neuter!) continuing in being as fully grown, unchanging phase.

⦁  the (masculine!) becoming decreasing prominent, fading to nothing phase.

  

(The descriptions and the labels are given in different combinations, but the underlying idea is the same)

  

I see parallels with William Shakespear's Seven ages of Man\*.

There they are not only named, but vividly so.

Though the substantives are limited to human ones the stages similarly temporal.

  

As to how or why this mis-labelling came about, I can only speculate, but to advance my case, I put forward almost the entire literature as circumstantial evidence

Viz. their authors invariable preference for synonyms of words, in place of the words themselves.

Which leaves the original intended word to get lost in the mists of time.

And without authors being around to question, to be incorrectly reverse engineered, to use a modern term.

  

I have searched for a full English text version of Bhartṛhari's text on Grammar to add to my collection, but there doesnt seem to be one?

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers,

  

\*All the world's a stage,

And all the men and women merely players;

They have their exits and their entrances,

And one man in his time plays many parts,

  

His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,

Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.

. . .
