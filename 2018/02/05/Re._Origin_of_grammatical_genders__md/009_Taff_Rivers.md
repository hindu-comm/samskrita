You seem to reagard me as some sort of enemy (:-)

  

However, please be assured that all is exactly as it appears to be, an unrelated question, which you have shown that you have understood clearly.

  

What my posts do have in common is the pursuit of factual information.

  

The question is posed to provoke discussion, so that I (at least), may learn something about linguistics in general.

A topic of a long term interest of mine, please take my question in this same way.

  

Given that Indo-Aryan is the mother language of the globally spoken English one, it is perfectly reasonable to ask such a question.

  

Please be assured that your inferrence is incorrect.

As I understanding it, the pursuit of knowledge is a laudable affliction.

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
