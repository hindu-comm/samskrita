Sri Sripada-ji,

  

Absolutely. Sanskrit gender is शब्दधर्म, that is the reason, in modern parlance, it is being called grammatical gender. If it is वस्तुधर्म, in modern parlance, it would have been called semantic gender. Sometimes it is called 'natural gender' too.

  

Sri Taff's question is 'why certain languages should develop grammatical gender which is not natural? '

  

  

Source of all confusion here is thinking about the meaning of the word gender in grammar in terms of gender in nature. Gender in grammar is only metaphorical usage, laakshaNika prayoga; it does not refer to any gender in nature.

  

It is the categorisation of morphophonemic changes occurring differently to different roots. roots leading to/allowing a certain kind of morphophonemic changes to form a word are considered to belong to a certain 'gender'.
