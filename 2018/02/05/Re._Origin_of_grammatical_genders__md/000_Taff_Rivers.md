Food for thought?

  

Many of the world's languages get by perfecctly well without any notion of grammatical gender.

  

Some languages that derive from Indo-Aryan ancestry, like English, which have seen fit to simplify matters somewhat by doing away with such complications, has revealed that they serve no material purpose, no matter how academic the subject matter.

  

Now, I have this theory that it might well have been necessary to make such distinctions in the distant past.

While most know***that***there is such a concept of grammatical gender.

If there anybody that can say***why***this is so, it must be our learned speakers of the ancient lingo.

  

It may well be obvious once it's mentioned, but no amount of Googling on my behalf has thrown any light on the linguistic matter.
