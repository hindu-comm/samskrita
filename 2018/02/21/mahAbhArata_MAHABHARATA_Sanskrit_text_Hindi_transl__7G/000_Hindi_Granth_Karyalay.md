Notes

The greatest epic of all

Impeccable Hindi translation  
Excellent paper, printing and binding

Super low price

  

The Mahabharata is a tour de force of writing. Nothing comes close. 

Comprising of 100217 Sanskrit verses, the Mahabharata is one of the crowning glories of the Indian civilisation. It was originally known as Jaya, and then as Bharata. Eventually, owing to its volume and the significance of its content, it began to be known as the Maha-Bharata. It is also known as the fifth Veda. It is considered as one of the greatest epics in the history of the world.

  

The text extols its own greatness:

"yad ihasti tad anyatra yan nehasti na tad kvacit"

All that is found elsewhere is present here. What is not present here does not exist.

  

This Edition

  

This is a beautifully printed and bound edition. The Sanskrit text has been thoroughly proofread and the Hindi translation is impeccable. It has been spotlessly printed on excellent paper with strong binding. The price has been heavily subsidised by the publishers.

  

The Work and its Significance

  

The Mahābhārata is an Indian Epic. It is also called the fifth Veda and its pre-eminence, along with the Rāmāyana’s, in South-Asian Studies is universally acknowledged.

  

The text extols its own greatness: "yad ihasti tad anyatra yan nehasti na tad kvacit"

{Whatever is here is elsewhere; whatever is not here, is nowhere.}

  

The Mahābhārata contains not only the celebrated Shrīmadbhagavadgītā but also a number of other such texts which are themselves independent treatises such as the Anugītā. It is a shining example of post-Vedic Indian literature.

  

Key Protagonists

  

Krishna : The greatest hero of the Mahābhārata. The man who leads the forces of goodness with great panache, at a time when the line between good and evil is blurred.

  

Bhīshma : In his vow of celibacy, taken to assuage his father’s desire for a new wife, lay the seeds of the Mahābhārata. Bhīshma leads an extraordinary life and his decisions have grave repercussions.

  

Kuntī : Mother of the Pāndavas, a decent and forgiving woman with the strength to forbear each blow that life sends her way.

  

Gāndhārī : Struggles to escape the web of political intrigue she is trapped in. Enmeshed in an intensely male dominated world, she is a strong mother vexed by her son Duryodhana’s machinations.

  

Karna : The eldest brother of the Pāndavas and the ultimate warrior. He personifies generosity. This supreme warrior seeks neither land nor wealth and sacrifices everything for the man who befriended him.

  

Yudhishthira : Reputed to be the embodiment of righteousness, pays a heavy price for his love of gambling.

  

Bhīma : Immensely strong and brave. He is an Obelix-like character, incredibly brave in battle, naive in other aspects.

  

Arjuna : The mighty warrior destined to become the champion of champions. The most dramatic incidents take place in Arjuna’s life—his winning of Draupadi’s hand, the Ashvamedha Yajna {horse sacrifice}, the battle with his own son, the kidnapping of Subhadrā, the incidents with Ulupī and Citrāngadā all add to the richness of his character.

  

Draupadī : An unusual character. Wife to five men, sister to Krishna and one of the most intriguing characters in world mythology. She emerges a victor after facing the most painful reversals of fortune.

  

Duryodhana : He is the ultimate hard mad. Enmeshed in a web of his own making, he shows no remorse. He is a good example of the corrosiveness of envy and greed, and the havoc they cause.

  

War: A devastating war that went on for eighteen days. The events that lead up to the war, the war itself, and its climax are all riveting. You can almost hear the clash of swords, the whooshing of arrows, the fearsome cries of the war elephants and the thundering of war chariots.
  
  
Significance of the Mahābhārata

  

The Mahābhārata does not glorify war. Instead, it makes us aware of the seeds of war and its cataclysmic consequences. Each protagonist will stay with you forever.

  

Besides its epic narrative of the battle between the Pāndavas and the Kauravas, the Mahābhārata contains much philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or purushārthas. The latter are enumerated as dharma {piety}, artha {profit}, kāma {pleasure}, and moksha {emancipation}.

  

Among the principal works and stories that are a part of the Mahābhārata are the Bhagavadgītā, the story of Damayantī, an abbreviated version of the Rāmāyana, and the Rishyashringa, often considered as independent works in their own right.

  

Authorship

  

Traditionally, the authorship of the Mahābhārata is attributed to Vyāsa. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (4th century CE). The title may be translated as "the great tale of the Bhārata dynasty". According to the Mahābhārata itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply Bhārata.

  

Comparison with Other Epics

  

With about one hundred thousand verses, long prose passages, or about 1.8 million words in total, the Mahābhārata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and Odyssey combined, or about four times the length of the Rāmāyana. W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahābhārata to world civilization to that of the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, the works of Homer, Greek drama, and the Qur'an.
