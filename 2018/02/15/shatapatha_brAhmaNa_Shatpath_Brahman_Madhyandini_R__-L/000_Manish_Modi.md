General Introduction

The Vedas are the apex of Hindu thought. Broadly speaking, Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and Arthaveda are the Upavedas, or minor Vedas. The Pratishakhyas were composed in order to facilitate a deeper understanding of the Vedas. The Brahmana texts, the Grihya Sutras, the Shrauta Sutra, the Aranyaka and the Upanishads are all branches disseminating Vedic learning.   
  

Introduction to the text  
The Shatpath Brahman, or the "Brāhmaṇa of 100 Chapters" is a prose text describing Vedic rituals and the history and beliefs associated with the Shukla YajurVeda. It describes the preparation of altars, ceremonial objects, ritual recitations, and the Soma libation, along with the symbolic attributes of every aspect of the ritual.

  

Two recensions of the Shatpath Brahman have survived the passage of time:

1.  Madhyandini Shakha recension

2.  Kanva Shakha recension.   
      

The current work is based on the Madhyandini Shakha, which has 100 chapters, comprising of 7,624 parts divided into 14 books.

-   The first 9 books have close textual commentaries, often line by
    line, of the first 18 books of the corresponding samhita of the
    Yajurveda.

-   The following 5 books cover supplementary material and include the
    celebrated Brihat Aranyaka Upanishad, which is considered by many to
    be the acme of spiritual wisdom.   
      

The 14 books of the Shatpath Brahman are known as under:

  

-   हविर्यज्ञम् Havi-Yajnam

&nbsp;

-   एकपादिका Eka-Padika

-   अध्वरम् Adhvara

-   ग्रहनाम Graha-Nama

-   सवम् Savam

-   उषासम्भरणम् Usha-Sambharana

-   हस्तिघटक Hasti-Ghataka

-   चिति: Citih

-   संचिति: Samcitih

-   अग्निरहस्यम् Agni-Rahasya

-   अष्टाध्यायी Ashta-Adhyayi

-   मध्यमम् (सौत्रामणी) Madhyama

-   अश्वमेधम् Ashvamedha

-   बृहदारण्यकम् Brihat Aranyaka

  

Each of the Vedas are associated with a specific Brahmana text

-   The RgVeda—Aitareya Brahman

-   Shukla YajurVeda—Shatpath Brahman

-   Krishna YajurVeda—Taittariya Brahman

-   SamaVeda—Tandya Brahman

-   AtharvaVeda—Gopath Brahman

  

Authors

The Shatpath Brahman was composed by Yajnavalkya. Most likely, he was assisted by Shandilya.   
  
Teleology behind the composition of the Brahman texts

The Brahman texts were composed in order to define precisely the mantras of the Vedas. Also, to standardise Vedic rituals in accordance with specific Vedic instructions. In addition to these two functions, they give an elaborate description of genesis as per the Vedic religion. They are widely accepted as absolutely authentic exegetical works on the Vedas. In fact, many traditions accept the Brahmans as part of the Vedic corpus.
