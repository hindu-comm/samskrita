Dhaval ji,

  

I was about to point out this to you.  
  

There are differences of opinion regarding the root form. While Maadhaviiya Dhaatuv.rtti and Dhaatu pradeep mark the entry as खच्, Kshiratarangini marks it as खव्.

My system provides correct forms with खच्.  

  

Further, since both खव्नाति as well as खौनाती are correct, we should provide both of them.

  

The rule for खव् -> खौ is च्छ्वो शूड् ...
