Dear Sir,

  

 While using the verb-form generator on [http://sanskrit.inria.fr](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/), I got some doubts. I took to Gérard Huett’s notice. He promptly and graciously responded to my mail. I am adding here some contents for the benefit of others.

  

\*\*\*\*\*START\*\*\*\*

**My Question:**

I am trying to use your website for conjugational forms of roots. Here is one such root is गाध् *gādh.*

Monier Williams dictionay identified this root in it.

But it seems the Heritage dictionary does not have it. I searched it but could not find. I tried for the conjugational forms of it using the verb-form generator.

  

**Gérard Huet’s reply: **

That is correct. I have the related root «gaah» which is used in classical Sanskrit, but the variant gaadh may be an original form of the root, maybe attested in Vedic works. Some k.rdantas of the root I list such as gaadha, gaa.dha.

Please note that Whitney Roots lists gaah with the above derivatives, but not the finite form gaadhate.

MW lists Dhaatupatha ii,3, but my experience is that many dhaatupaathas are full of forms that are nowhere attested.

Do you have an attested classical sentence with a finite verbal form of gaadh ? If so, I might consider adding the gaadhate paradigm.



**My Question:**

It seems that the tool has not recognized the input given as the authentic root accoriding the entries in its Heritage dictinary. But this root exists in MW dictionary.

  

**Gérard Huet’s reply: **

When the conjugation tool returns a question mark, it means that it does not know this root under this spelling, and thus that the forms shown are theoretical, butmay not be recognized by the reader.



The Heritage dictionary does not cover all forms in Monier-Williams, of course.



\*\*\*\*\*END\*\*\*\*

So when there is question mark in the output of the verb-generator, it means the that the root does not exist in the Heritage dictionary. In majority of cases, I have come across, even though there is a question mark, the output was correct when I cross checked with other resources.

But here is a one instance, when question mark shown in the output, does not match with other resources.

I was trying to find the conjugational forms of the root कुर्द् *kurd*.

Here is the output form INRIA
