Dear Ramamurthy ji,  
  

The forms on both <http://sanskrit.inria.in> as well as those on <http://scl.samsaadhanii.in> are correct according to different dhaatuvrttis.  

While Maadhaviiya dhaatuv.rtti attests the forms of the latter one Dhaatupradeep attests those shown on the former.

  

And interestingly MW has a mixture of the two.  
  

Thank you for bringing this to our notice, we would incorporate them in our next release.  
  

With kind regards,  

Amba
