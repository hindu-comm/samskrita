Ramana murthy,

  

Two points.

-   By what criteria do you discriminate between a good Sanskrit scholar
    from a not so good scholar?  

That would be useful guide to all us non-scholars.

-   I used DOS in the pre WWW days, with legacy Devanagari Fonts.  

I can assure you that there were indeed errors.

Whereas an individual, myself included, may not have personally experienced any.

Microsoft, that maintains compilations of reports from the odd billion or so users provides evidence to the contrary.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers,
