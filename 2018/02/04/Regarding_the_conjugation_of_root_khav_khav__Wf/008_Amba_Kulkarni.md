No I have not forgotten. I'm well aware of the limitations of my each of the modules.

  

My concern was regarding your usage of the word 'derived from' in

"There you will also learn that it's facilities are **derived from** the well established and well maintained<http://sanskrit.inr>[ia.fr/index.en.html](http://ia.fr/index.en.html)".  
  
Just to make the point clear:  
  

We at the University of Hyderabad developed various tools for Sanskrit Processing, later on we had a consortium of Indian Institutes,  
who collaborated together towards the improvement of existing and the development of new tools, avoiding any duplication as far as possible.  

During the same time we had international collaboration, and we decided to avoid the duplication of efforts again. Under this collaboration, we

hosted the mirror site of Heritage Platform of Gérard Huet and also are working towards using the sophisticated segmenter of Huet in my sentential  

parser as one of the components. Similarly, when Dhaval Patel started work on the verb form generator, stopped working towards it, and we share our resources.  

  

With kind regards,

Amba
