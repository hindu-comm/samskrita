Dear Ramana Murthy and Ramesh,  
  
Thank you very much for bringing this to my notice.  
  

Yes, as you have noticed the
<http://tdil-dc.in/san/skt_>gen/generators.html website, which hosts the old version (2013)  
of my tools produces correct forms while the latest version on <http://scl.samsaadhanii.in> produces the wrong forms.  
  

And the reason behind this change is at some point Dhaval Patel cross checked the forms generated by my system with that of his, and provided me a file with list of corrections.  
And in this process wrong forms generated by his system replaced my old correct forms.  
<https://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/panini.php?first=%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%81&upasarga=&lakAra=law&sanAdi=&tran=SLP1&vAcya=kartR&frontend=1&jsonmode=0&cond11=2&number=09.0068&removed_sutras=&step=11&type=tiGanta>  
  

I'll revert back to the old correct forms.  
  

Thanks and regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
