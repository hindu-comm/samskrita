Dear Ramana Murthy,  
  

You're right: without a live teacher learning anything nontrivial is very difficult, however well-written the books and websites are. But with the teacher learning isn't guaranteed either: there exist people who have spent years learning Sanskrit in the traditional way and learned very little. Or how about someone who has learned much but still doesn't know something. With teacher or without, the key point is that nothing in life is guaranteed. We can put forward effort, do our best, and that's all.  
  

On a practical note, you now know that the sites you are using mostly produce correct forms but occasionally don't. I suggest, when you have a mysterious form, to check it on both sites. If one day you find that neither of them produces the correct form, that will send you in search of another site, which will pleasantly surprise you - or maybe it won't. One step at a time - that's all anyone can do.  
  

I wouldn't worry too much about these matters, just note that they exist. You have set yourself on a productive course of action by gradually working through a reputable grammar - that's what matters most.  
  

Irene
