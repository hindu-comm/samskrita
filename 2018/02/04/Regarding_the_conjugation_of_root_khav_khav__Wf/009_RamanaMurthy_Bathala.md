Dear Taff Rivers,

I also refer the tools on the website : [http://sanskrit.inria.fr](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/)

When I crossed checked the outputs of noun/verb forms with the text books, I found there are discrepancies/ variations between the text book version and website version. So even this website is not error-proof. If I remember correctly, I took it to the notice of the its web administrators. But, as for as memory goes, I did not receive any response from them. Which one is correct? Text book version or web version? Even in text books, there may be typos. Sanskrit grammar is very difficult for the beginner/student to learn on his/her own.

Recently I rember one root which gave different forms at different books and websites.

A PRACTICAL GRAMMAR OF THE SANSKRIT LANGUAGE- Fourth Edition-MONIER WILLIAMS Page No. 165



340. भस् *bhas*, 'to eat,' 'to shine,' like जन् *jan*, rejects the radical अ *a* before the vowel-terminations not marked with P; and भ् *bh* coalescing with स् *s* becomes प् *p* by 44 (Pres.S.Du.Pl.3. बभस्ति *babhasti*, बभस्तस् *babhastas*, बप्सति *bapsati*). The same contraction takes place before terminations beginning with त् *t*, त्य *tya*, but the final स् *s* is then dropped, and the usual rules of Sandhi applied; thus,

बभ् *babh* + ताम् *tām* = बब्धाम् *babdhām* by 298.

Then I tried the conjugational forms of root भस् *bhas* on the web tools.

To summarise them in a tabular form:

  

[TABLE]



Singular forms are same for all.

For Dual, MW and Infra concur where as tdil & scl differ.

For Plural, MW, tdil & scl concur where as Infra differs.



It may be possible that muliple forms are correct. In that case, conjuational table should list all the correct forms. This avoids the ambiguity in the mind of a student.



Moreover, it is not possible to provide the bugs/error free software/tools. As per my knowledge, most of the Operating Systems provided by Microsoft have some kind of bug in them. Only OS which is bugs-free I have come across is MS-DOS !!!.



Finally what I understand is this: All these computational linguistic tools are helpful but they can not substitute well versed sanskrit schloars in learning process. That’s why I reach to the scholars in this groups. Ancient way of learning in India by a student is by sitting at the feet of Guru and learning the subject.
