Ramana murthy,

  

 Yes, but that site is not so much faulty as unfinished. As is explained in its scl_help.pdf.

There you will also learn that it's facilities are derived from the well established and well maintained<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/index.en.html>

  

I asssume that you wish to employ a Grammar facility rathert than simply reporting a 'faulty' one.

If so, access Grammar from inria's menu bar at the bottom of the screen, but do avail yourself of Help on that menu bar to understand how to use that Grammar facility!

  

Best,

  

Taff Rivers.
