Dear Taff Rivers Sir,

  

Pranams.

  

1\) As an individual, I had not come across the bugs in MS-DOS in those old days.

  

2\) Second, regarding the versed scholars, the term is subjective. I regard MONIER-WILLIAMS and WILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY as well versed western Sanskrit Scholars. This my personal opinion. But this is not the point of contention.

  

Regards

Ramana mrthy
