Amba,

  

Re. mAdhavlya.png.

  

If I may be so bold, not as one of them scholars but as one of them 'inteligent readers'. (a certified one - I have a certificate from IBM to prove it (:-) ):

  

What you have done with that facility, is to *compare* one single text with another, thus to reveal similarities and differences.

A comprehensive study, that provides evidence, that the two text are not entirely in agreement.

  

'Compare and contrast' is a mantra of all good teachers, when they hand out some homework.

  

A *concordance*, however,**is an entirely process.

Concordanceis a lexicographers tool, used to find all occurrences of a given word in a vast data base of textual material.

Such as the entire Vedic/Classic works.

  

The object being to reveal the multiple senses (meanings) in which that one word is employed.

From which to build a dictionary.

Both kinds of software to compare or concord, are, and have been, freely available on the web for decades.

  

Anyone, can now, compare and contrast the old with the new, and *selectively* make changes.

Programmers have long employed such facilities to inspect the consequences of those changes. (Think medical systems, ICBMs...)

  

Those MW's and Worterbuch's were compiled from texts that were as known in those days.

  

I understand that the efforts of Meseur Huet's team will contribute to an eagerly awaited revised edition of the famous MW.
