Taff,  
  

The title of the web page is "Concordance of Pāṇinian Dhātuvṛttis" and if you look at the page, you will notice the concordance of verbal roots from the three Dhaatuv.rttis.

  

One of the meanings of Concordance, listed in the WordNet is :harmony, concord, concordance -- (agreement of opinions)  

  

This justifies the use of the word 'concordance'. Further, this work is in continuation of Palsule's Concordance of Dhaatupaathas.  
  

On the web version, it was possible for us to provide the links to the commentaries as well, in addition to showing the agreements among various scholars.
