Sunder, (not cross-posted)

  

 There are of course, numerous bhāsyas on the YS. All readily available for downloading and formatting any which way one pleases.

  

Side-by-side listings, are instrumental to an end.

Because commentators give different interpretations, of a sutra, without justifying their interpretation, leave matters up to the reader to as to which are the most credible.

  

It can be seen that the given interpretations, conform to one or other of the set of meanings, as enumerated in a lexicon of their choice,

but all avoid making any attempt at justifying their favouring their particular choice of meaning over the others.

  

Concealment gives ground for suspicion of the motives of the concealer...

 facts, can beinconvenientas they are subject to verification, but if there aren't any facts...

  

To be instrumental, those side-by-sides have to be classified into groups or schools.

  

By definition, all viewpoints are unique to the internal world-view of the viewer.

Exposing ones viewpoints is to expose ones weaknesses to the world, which not something insecure people are in favour of doing.

Incorrect viewpoints are open to correction - if expressed.

  

Such listings will then, expose the existence of other viewpoints, that they viewer may update there own more crediible version.

The prime mover, in all these doings, is the mind.

Mind, having 31 period separated instances, even in the abridged version of my Webster's, I shall have to be specific:

Mind, in the sense of that which minds, the brain.

  

The YS itself, informs us that the mind-brain is heirarchical in nature.

Mere facts are subordinate to pride (ānanda) etc.

  

On this level, the criteria for appointing a sutra to a particular school also needs to be justified, unless obvious...

  

Taff Rivers,

  

I didn't think to download those six, at the time.
