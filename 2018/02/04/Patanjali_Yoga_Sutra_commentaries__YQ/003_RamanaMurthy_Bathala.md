Dear Sir,

  

1. There are four major yogas as per Hindu philosophy. Bhakti Yogo(Devotional), Karma Yoga (Functional), Raja Yoga (Restraining), and jnana Yoga (intellectual).

  

2. In the second aphorism :

योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः॥२॥ (Yoga is the restraint of fluctuations of the mind.)

  

 Here the word “योग’ is used. Does it indicate all the four yogas or just Raja Yoga?

In none of the commentaries I have come across, this doubt is clarified. Is the restraing of the mind happening in Bakthi Yoga, karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga.

  

In the aphorism, just word योग is used but not clear which Yoga. If any book clearly mentions explicitly that the aphorism योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः is applicable only to Raja Yoga, not to other three Yogas, please provide that book details.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
