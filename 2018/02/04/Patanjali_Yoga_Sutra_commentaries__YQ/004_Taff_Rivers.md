Ramana murthy,

  

All that's needed is the text of the YS itself - and a large amount of time, effort and determination on the part of the reader.

Retired citizens will have the first of those three in abundance, the other two are voluntary...

  

Let me elaborate.

You will find that all suchtextsfollow a similar top-down pattern.

They begin with a one line description of the purpose of the work.

In modern terms such works are called a *treatise*.

  "a formal and systematic exposition in writing of the principles of a subject".

  

Read that marvellous example of the of lexicographer's art very carefully, word by word.

It is important to do this as it prevents the reader from getting lost in these metaphorical forests of words.

  

As to just how important this is, you will see for yourself, by carrying out this simple excercise:-

⦁ Now, take the trouble to describe to yourself what you currently understand by 'treatise'.

⦁ Take the effort to read said description.

⦁ Then, you will realise exactly where you stand in this particular dense forest.

  

You will then be in ready to proceed to the next instruction.

⦁ Proceed as above through the entire text!

  

However, even a quick skim through the text, would answer your own question for you.

Viz. YS II. 29, states that there are famously eight limbs to the process, to be performed sequentially.

There, you will find your 'āsana' listed as the third one in the sequence.

A lexicon (the MW) glosses 'āsana' as 'sitting, sitting down'

And YS II. 46 qualifies 'āsana' as being steady and comfortable.

\- the very opposite of the strenuoushaṭha practice.

and given the objective of this entire practice, it makes perfectly good sense.

  

Again, your 'jñāna' is to be founded embedded in the eighth process 'saṃyāma' 

 per YS. III. 12. - The very first in a large hierarchy of them.

  

The man himself does advise as to the time, effort and determination on the part of the reader.

I will let you identify where...

  

There is only one way to verify the actual existence of the stated objective.

Words can but point out the way to such an objective as this, the travelling is left up to the traveller.

  

Regards,

  

 Guru Taff Rivers
