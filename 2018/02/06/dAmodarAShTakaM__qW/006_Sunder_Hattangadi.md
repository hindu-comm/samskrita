Pranams Abhyankara-ji,

  

      You may not have to struggle too much with this text as it is available in Devanagari script (atṭ.)

One good thing is that every shloka is followed by break-up of all conjugated words and English translation of every such broken-up word. Although this appeals to be good at first glance, translation of compound words becomes subjective. Also translation of विभक्त्यर्थ-s also becomes subjective.

  

I have made for myself a Google-document \<<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFmHmqYtFC-35CPhtBHARghjT84G7So4wwE40YR78iY/edit?usp=sharing>\>. The Roman transliteration of Sanskrit texts is looking challenging, because it does not seem to follow any particular well-known scheme. There are the words transliterated as "drutya", "gopya", which may be read as द्रुत्य / द्रुत्या, गोप्य / गोप्या.

  

I am left wondering why people do not put Sanskrit texts in देवनागरी.

  

I shall have to do lot of self-study work on it, starting with putting all Sanskrit text inदेवनागरी.
