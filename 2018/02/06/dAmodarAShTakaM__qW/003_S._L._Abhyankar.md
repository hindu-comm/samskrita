According to the स्तोत्रम् available at [this link](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_vishhnu/satyavratoktadAmodarastotram.html?lang=sa), this स्तोत्रम् was composed by सत्यव्रत, who was born in सिन्धुदेश but traveled to वृन्दावन and composed this अष्टकम् -नमामीश्वरं सच्चिदानन्दरूपं लसत्कुण्डलं गोकुले भ्राजमानम् ... All this preface is mentioned in the first four verses. So, theअष्टकम् itself starts from verse #5 and goes up to verse #12. Actually verse #12 is sort of an epilogue put up as a quote by नारद. The portion सत्यव्रत उवाच is in verses 5 to 11 only.
