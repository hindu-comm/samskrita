Dear Sir,

  

I am looking for l Yogavasistha with all the 32000 slokas in sanskrit script book soft copy pdf/kindle version or online version.

Most of the books available in archive are English translations without original Sanskrit slokas.

If soft copies are available in amazon or somewhere else please provide the link of the same.

  

It seems there is hard copy version with all sanskrit slokas available ::<http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/yoga-vasistha-of-valamiki-4-volumes-IDF619/>

  

But this is hardcopy, they are not providing softcopy version.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
