“In greatness, the upādhyāya exceeds ten ācārya‑s, the father exceeds ten upādhyāya‑s, and the mother exceeds ten fathers or \[even\] the entire earth. There is no guru like the mother.” (Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira, [~~#~~**Mahābhārata**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata?src=hash) 13.105.14–15)
