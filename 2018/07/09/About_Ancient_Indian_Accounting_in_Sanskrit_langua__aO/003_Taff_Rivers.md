Recording commercial transactions originated with the trading of sheep and goats and other goods.

Made by pressing seals and scratching onto clay tokens. Long before written contracts.

Both parties would keep a set.

  

'Book keeping with books learned from manuals (śāstra) would have come about much later that head counting and more scratchings...

  

Best,
