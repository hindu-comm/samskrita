कुटिला लक्ष्मीर्यत्र प्रभवति न सरस्वती वसति तत्र

प्रायः श्वश्रूस्नुषयोर्न दृश्यते सौहृदं लोके

  

kuṭilā lakṣmīryatra prabhavati na sarasvatī vasati tatra  
prāyaḥ śvaśrūsnuṣayorna dṛśyate sauhṛdaṃ loke  

  

Sarasvati doesn't live where crooked Lakshmi prevails. Perhaps it's because in this world no affection or friendship is to be found between a woman and her mother-in-law

  

====

This is an interpretation I read a while ago:

  

Puranas describe Brahma as having emerged from Vishnu (a lotus connected to Vishnu's navel, to be precise) and thus he can be considered a son of Lakshmi, Vishnu's wife. Saraswati is Brahma's wife and hence Lakshmi's daugher-in-law. :-)
