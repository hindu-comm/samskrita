Dear list

  

I am pleased to share these photos with you. Bombay Hospital at Marine Lines, South Bombay, was founded by Rameshwar Das Birla of the illustrious Birla family and was inaugurated in 1950 by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. At the entrance of its old building, two plaques have three #Sanskrit verses (two śārdūlavikrīḍita-s, one anuṣṭup) on Sardar Patel. There are a few spelling errors in the verses (breaking the metre), I am sure most members can make out the correct reading despite this.

  

PS: I do not know who composed these verses and would be grateful for any help on this.
