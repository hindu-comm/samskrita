I have a copy of Panchatantra published by Motilal Banarasidas that has full text with Sanskrit & Hindi vyakhyas (word by word meanings in Sanskrit and a textual translation in Hindi). I did a google search and found that it is still available for buying: <https://www.mlbd.com/BookDecription.aspx?id=5408>
