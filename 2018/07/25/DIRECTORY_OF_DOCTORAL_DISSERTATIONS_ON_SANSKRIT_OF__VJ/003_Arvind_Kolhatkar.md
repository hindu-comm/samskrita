Dear Group,

  

Sometimes, while looking for something else on Google, you came across a link like this:

<http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92023/7/07_chapter%201.pdf>

  

If you click on it, you reach a chapter in a thesis. If the contents of the chapter interest you and you would like to read/download the full thesis, there is no obvious way to reach that thesis. In such circumstances the following trick will help you to reach the cover page of the thesis with links to all chapters thereof and other associated content:

  

1\) Replace the word 'bitstream' with the word 'handle'. 2) Delete everything that comes after the two numbers.

  

This done, the available link

<http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92023/7/07_chapter%201.pdf>

becomes

<http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/92023/>

  

Now copy/paste <http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/92023/> in your browser and you will reach the cover page of the thesis.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar
