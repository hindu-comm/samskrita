Meaning given to vighneswara-pada-pankajam seems to be artificial thinking it to be aarsha.  
In one of the explanations it was suggested to emd it at namami, making the rest nirarthakam.  
Can we interpret it as  
Vighnanam iiswarah (controller) paada-pakajam yasya tam.  
In campu ramayana the first sloka is...  
Laksmiim tanotu... anghridwayam..  
Hairambam...  
Vighnadribhedasatadharadhurandhar nah.  
(His feet is citting all obstacles. So we pray to him who has feet capable of removing all obstacles)  
  
Or..  
Is there any version like..  
namami vighneswaram.... Pankajam.  
  
Kindly enlighten.
