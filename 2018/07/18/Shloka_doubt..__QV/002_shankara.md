Namaste,

  

This sloka was discussed is detail in 2002 January issue of 'Sambahshanasandesa' magazine. The explanation given was as follows.

  

विः - पक्षी, वीन् हन्ति इति विघ्नः - व्याधः, तेषाम ईश्वरः - परमेश्वरः, तस्य पादः - पत्नी पार्वती, पार्वत्याः शरीरपङ्कात् जातः खलु विघ्नेश्वरः। अतः पक्षीणां हन्तुः नायकस्य पत्न्याः शरीरपङ्कात् जातः गजाननः इति तात्पर्यं सिद्ध्यति।

  

Thus विघ्नेश्वरपादपङ्कजम् is an adjective of गजाननम्.  

  

Attaching the complete article from [sambhashanasandesha.in](http://sambhashanasandesha.in).  

  

regards  
shankara
