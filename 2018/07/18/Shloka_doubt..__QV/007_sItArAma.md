Thank you Abhyankar ji for the explanation.

My doubt was not about shloka I posted. It was about the twisted explanation provided by Shankara about **पादपङ्कजम्**

  

Original post

गजाननं भूतगणादिसेवितंकपित्थजम्बूफलसारभक्षितम्  
उमासुतं शोकविनाशकारणंनमामि विघ्नेश्वर**पादपङ्कजम्** ॥  

so my question was why twist the expression with unnecessary logic. **पादपङ्कजा /** **पादपङ्कजम्**Is used at many places in the literature
