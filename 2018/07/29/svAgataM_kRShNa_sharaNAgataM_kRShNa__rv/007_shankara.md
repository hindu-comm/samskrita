Namaste,

  

Sabdataravali, a Malayalam lexicon, defines Kalabha as a mixture of 8 stubstances. Sandalwood is one among them.

shankara

कळभ/कलभ is also a word in Malayalam, a south Indian language. It means sandalwood paste that devotees apply to their foreheads. The same word (कलभ) appears inकलभाभिषेकम् (I'm using Devanagari to transliterate a Malayalam word), which means applying sandalwood paste to aमूर्ति in temple (this is usually performed by a priest). कलभ is also used loosely to mean a mixture.
