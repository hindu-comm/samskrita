नमो नमः,

  

I know that the topic of extracting devanagari text from pdf files keeps coming up in various forums. So far, the solutions I have seen involve some manual work (figure out the font, copy/paste the text into a suitable converter, etc.). Has there been any effort to create an automated/programmatic way to extract the text? If not, any thoughts on the best way to go about doing so will be welcome. I am specifically interested in the pdfs corresponding to AIR Sanskrit News.  

  

For context - I was having an offline discussion with an acquaintance about the lack of a speech-to-text/text-to-speech program for Sanskrit (at least, I am unaware of any). We were discussing ideas for collecting a database for research and experimentation. The recent thread regarding AIR news sparked the thought that it could be a potential bootstrap database since audio and corresponding text (mostly) are available. As Shree Pooja pointed out, these have been collected for the last 5-6 years in <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/samskrithanews>. I've already created a python script to download the attachments from this group and will make the script and data available soon. Unfortunately, the text for the news program is only available as a pdf on this forum. Hence this question. Alternately, if you are aware of a source for the plain text in the news programs, please point that out as well.

  

भवत्कृतज्ञः,

अविनाशः

  

P.S. - I am aware of a few other audio sources such as (<https://archive.org/details/bAlamodinI-01>) that have the corresponding text. The same question applies in many of these cases, as the text is largely available in pdf.
