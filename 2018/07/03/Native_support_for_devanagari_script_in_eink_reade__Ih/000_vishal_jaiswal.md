Does the basic version of the 8th generation amazon kindle support the devanagari script natively ?  
By native, I mean that I should be able to put a plain text file with samskrit typed in it, and be able to read the same. Not pdf or word or etc.  
If this has not yet been implemented in the kindle, can anyone recommend other brands that have this feature?  
Please note that I am searching for a passive eink display, not a tablet.  
And if a backlight is present, I should have the ability to turn it off completely, not partially.  
  
Thanks,  
Vishal
