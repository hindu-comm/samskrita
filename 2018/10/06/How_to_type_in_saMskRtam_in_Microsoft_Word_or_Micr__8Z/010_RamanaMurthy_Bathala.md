Dear Sir,

  

I have been using Baraha ([www.baraha.com](http://www.baraha.com)) commercial software. It is an excellent software. With this, we can type Devanagiri/Telugu/Kannada/Tamil/Malayalam and other Indian languages directly into microsoft products like Word,excel, power point, etc. and even in notepad.

  

Regards  
Ramana murthy
