All,

  

A STUDY ON THE ANUBANDHAS AND PRATYAHARAS

OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF GRAMMAR

  

While seaching for English meanings in rhe Dhātupāţha, I came across this PhD. study on the differentsystems of Sanskrit grammar bySwami Muni Narayan Prasad,

  

Avalailable for download as a series of pdfs from:

  

<http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/128784>

  

It is in English and Nagari (but without transliterations),

and gives many examples, with explainations, of the applications of the rules of as given by those grammarians.

  

Hoping it may be of interest.

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
