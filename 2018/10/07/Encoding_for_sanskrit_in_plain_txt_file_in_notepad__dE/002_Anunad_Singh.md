I thing the problem is not described well. Please state clearly-  
  
1) Are you able to type and see the Devanagari (Sanskrit) in notepad?  
  
2) Is it that you are able to type and see Sanskrit in notepad, but  
when you save the text file and open it again in chrome browser, you  
do not see Devanagari characters but something else?  
  
3) Are you able to see the text file correctly in internet explorer  
but not in chrome?
