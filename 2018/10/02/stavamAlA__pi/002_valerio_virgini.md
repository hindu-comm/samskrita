Pranam Abhyankar ji  

  

Thanks for the reply  

I study Sanskrit to try to know something of transcendence. :-)  

  

  

  

the word I had highlighted is  

  

विब्हु चइतद्āनन्द्āत्मो  

  

The verse is clear to me, but what I do not understand is that part of the comment.  

  

thanks

valerio
