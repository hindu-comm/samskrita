Hi,

  

BA in Sanskrit is also offered by Rashtriya Sanskrita Vidyapeerham Tirupati. This is offered in regular and distance education mode. I believe that the last date for admissions this academic year is extended up to this month end. You may want to check their website below.

Thanks

Viswanatham
