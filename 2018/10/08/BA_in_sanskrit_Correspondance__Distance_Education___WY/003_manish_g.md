नमस्ते..

Thank you for your response. I will check the links suggested.

I went through राष्ट्रिय-संस्कृत-संस्थानम् site, bud did not find the 5 level courses you talked about, However the site directed me to Mukta Svadhyaya Peetham ( Institute of Distance Education) and they provide similar courses,  

Prak-Shastri (+2) , Prak-Shastri Bridge, Shastri (B.A.), Shastri Bridge, Acharya (M.A.).  

  

Since I am graduate ( with No Sanskrit), there are some institutes that provide 'Bridge' course for the same.

I will also have a look at भारतीय विद्या भवन as you mentioned.

Thank you very much, and I appreciate your response.
