नमस्ते श्रीमन् मनीष-महोदय !

राष्ट्रिय-संस्कृत-संस्थानम् has a 5-level course, each level named as a दीक्षा - hence प्रथमा दीक्षा ... पञ्चमी दीक्षा There are also alternate names to these 5 levels.

1.  प्रथमा दीक्षा - व्यवहारावतरणी (व्यवहार-अवतरणी) 2.  द्वितीया दीक्षा - व्यवहारावगाहिनी (व्यवहार-अवगाहिनी) 3.  तृतीया दीक्षा - काव्यावतरणी (काव्य-अवतरणी) 4.  चतुर्थी दीक्षा - काव्यावगाहिनी (काव्य-अवगाहिनी) 5.  पञ्चमी दीक्षा - व्युत्पादिनी

As can be seen most of संस्कृत-व्यवहार is covered in first two levels only. The third and fourth levels deal in काव्य. That is interesting, because most of Sanskrit literature is काव्य.

  

The entire course is structured as a "Teach Yourself" course. The राष्ट्रिय-संस्कृत-संस्थानम् has its own prescribed textbooks. They are very low-priced. This 5-level course is to be done by doing the 5 examinations.

  

For all these good points, the biggest drawback is the examination-system. You do the examination and results will come after 6 months. In that period, a "Teach Yourself" student will lose all his enthusiasm, remaining in suspense about what the result is going to be !

  

I did प्रथमा दीक्षाand द्वितीया दीक्षाtogether, in one go. Yes, one can do that, if one has "taught oneself" as good. When the results came after about six months, I was only verbally told that I had passed both with 92% score. Certificates will come only after another "n" number of months ! I have not checked whether and when the certificates came in at the center, where I did the examinations. Nor the people at the center bothered to inform me. I also did not bother to collect my certificates,

  

I guess, first four levels should be equivalent to BA in Sanskrit and the fifth level, because it is named व्युत्पादिनी (विशेषम् उत्पादनम् अस्याः इति व्युत्पादिनी = special creativity from this one) should be equivalent to MA.

  

If the examination system, i.e. declaration of results and issuance of certificates improves, it is a good scheme.

  

राष्ट्रिय-संस्कृत-संस्थानम् also has a website<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/> and राष्ट्रिय-संस्कृत-संस्थानम् is a GOI-organisation and its certificates would have recognition all over India.
