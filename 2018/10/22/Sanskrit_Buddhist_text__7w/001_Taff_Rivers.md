Sikkhakāmo Manusso,  
  
 Always a good place to start a top level search is Wikipedia

  

the English language version is <https://en.wikipedia.org>

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_Buddhist_literature>

should be wortha look.  

  

Check out the ref. section for downloads.

  

  

Hope this helps
