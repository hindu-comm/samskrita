The example:

"29.Respected teacher is teaching the students.

⇔ *pūjyāḥ gurucaraṇāḥśiṣyān pāṭhayanti.*

([respected.pl](http://respected.pl)) ([teacher.pl](http://teacher.pl)) (students.ACC) (teach.PR)"

made me think of something which I thought people might find interesting if they don't already know it.

  

In English, when speaking to one person, the appropriate 2nd person accusative pronoun used to be "thee". The plural, "you", became used as an honorific to refer to only one person when denoting respect, originally to people with higher social standing.

  

This is mirrored in French, where "toi" is used for close friends and "vous" in more formal circumstances.

  

In English, people became so respectful and formal with one another that they completely forgot how to use the singular. So we always say "you", but in its origins it was plural.  

  

I had thought this difference was most closely mirrored in the distinction in*Saṁskr̥ta*between "*bhavantam*" vs "*tvām*", but apparently one can use the plural just as in English and French?
