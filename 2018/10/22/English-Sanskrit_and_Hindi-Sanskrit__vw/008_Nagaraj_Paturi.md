Historically 'you' in contemporary English had its honorific connotation.

  

Modern English has no grammatical system of honorific speech, with formality and informality being conveyed entirely by register, word choice, tone, rhetorical strategy, etc.[Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English")once exhibited a T–V distinction between the 2nd person singular pronoun*[thou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou "Thou")*and the 2nd person plural*[ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_(pronoun) "Ye (pronoun)")*and later*[you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You "You")**, with the latter being used as an honorific regardless of the number of addressees.**Thou*and its associated forms have fallen into disuse and are considered archaic, though it is often used in recreations of archaic-sounding speech. It has also survived in some dialect forms of English, notably in some regions of Yorkshire, especially amongst the older and more rural populations.*Ye*usage can still be found in pockets of the east coast of North America, such as rural Newfoundland.

It lost its specific honorific connotation with the extinction of 2nd person singular pronoun thou.

  

History of 'thou' and 'you' is similar to the history of तू, तुम and आप in certain class dialects of Hindi. In these class dialects, even the first person singular मैं gets replaced by हम. The phenomenon in both the cases of 1st and 2nd person pronouns in this class dialect of Hindi is honorific form replacing the singular form.

The sociolinguistic process behind 'you' replacing 'thou' in English is very much similar.
