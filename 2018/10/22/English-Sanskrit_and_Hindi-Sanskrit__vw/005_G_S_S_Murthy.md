In my view, addressing every senior person, whom you would address "aap" in Hindi, in plural of uttamapurushaor madhyamapuruSha (bhavantaH) in Sanskrit is a comparatively recent usage. In Ramayana, Mahabharataand classic literature in Sanskrit, Rushisand royalties are addressed, by and large, in singular only. " bhavaankartumarhati" or "tvamkartumarhasi" occurs frequently while addressing even respected persons. I believe the usageof regular plural to denote respect is borrowed from Hindi and "Respected" persons have nothing to complain. And therefore who (includes me too) does not want to ingratiate himself/ herself with the "respected person"?

Profound Regards,

Murthy
