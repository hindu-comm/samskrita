Ramakrishnan D,

  

 I am able to download from Google.

  

Here are details of the source:

  

"Translation Divergence in English-Sanskrit-Hindi Language Pairs"  



taken from

"Sanskrit Computational Linguistics: Third International Symposium, Hyderabad, India, January 15-17, 2009. Proceedings"  

  

Its URL is

<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221145933>  

  

which redirects to a slow site in India...

  

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers

  

I am posting theattachment directly to you via email.
