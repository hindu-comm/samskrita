Learned and unlearned ones,

  

There are often disagreements when we discuss Sanskrit in English or Hindi.  

  

It would seem that we have much to learn about word order, category mistakes and so on:

such that we should read about different types of meanings (divergences) found in a pair of translation languages,  

as in the attached.

  

  

Regards,
