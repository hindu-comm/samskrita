Everyone unanimously says the meaning of guru in line with below wiki article.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru>

  

Gu = Darkness, Ru = remover or dispeller.  

  

So far no one could tell me how the meaning of "Gu" and "ru" became what is claimed above.

What dhatu's were used to get the meaning of Darkness and Remover.



I would appreciate your help
