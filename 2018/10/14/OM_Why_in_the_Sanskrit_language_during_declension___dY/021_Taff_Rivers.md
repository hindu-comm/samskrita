All,  
  
Regarding bilingual statements such as

  

    'feeling of “inside”, “on” etc.,अधिकरणand सप्तमीinside'

  

It is very necessary to be aware of 'differences', in matters involving translation, or things can get veryconfusing.

  

The aboveis a case in point.

The English 'inside' 'on' etc., relate to locations within a space. And *only In space*.

Whereas the sanskrit विभक्तिःrelate to locations *within time as wellas space*.  

  

So, English has a spacial grammatical case, but no temporal case.

Matters of tine are expressed by combinations of words that includeprepositions or auxiliaries

  

Again, mind-stuff andcitta.

  

Mind 'stuff', would be what a brain surgeon sees - matter

Whereas thought stuff (citta) is unseable- energy.

  

Myself, I am often in need of many kilos of that mind-stuff, but I never been able to locateany, not even in the land of Bhārata.

  

As far as tables of rules are concerned. They go from the general to *types of particulars*.

The given table has been *derived* from the Aṣtādhyāyī.

To derive such tables for each and every particular would be a monumental task.

  

Unfortunately, these things are not taught in the classroom.

  

Regards,
