The OP asked - "Why, in the Sanskrit language, during declension, does the suffix word change when the ending letter of the previous word change? What is the rationale behind using different sounds, to convey the same feeling, just because the ending letter changes?"

  

This is the wrong way of looking at Sanskrit words. Words were already there in veda. Before Panini many other acharyas tried to create grammar rules that would fit words changes. Panini came along and nailed it with his structure.  

Rules did not create words, words were there before rules came into existence. Patterns were observed by Rishi's.  

  

Another example to put things into context - Gravity was there before Newton nailed it with a mathematical expression.  

  

Regarding the link Taff posted seems excellent inspired work from Pt. Yudhisthira Mimamsak - book on undersanding Sanskrit declensions. I am attaching front page of that book. Its in Hindi and published by RamLal Kapoor trust.
