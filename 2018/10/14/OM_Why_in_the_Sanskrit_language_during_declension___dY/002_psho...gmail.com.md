I interpreted his question differently.

  

For example, to arrive at सप्तमी (7th case) singular, Panini instructs that 'इ' be added to the noun-base:

  

Accordingly, we arrive at these 7th cases:

  

\[1\] धर्मक्षेत्र + इ ->धर्मक्षेत्रे  

\[2\] मरुत् + इ -> मरुति  

  

\[note\] I'm not sure whether it's as simple as just adding इ. I know almost next to nothing about derivations using Panini's system. But for the time being let's pretend that these derivations are 1-step derivations and that they're correct.

  

Now, for a base such as कवि, this addition of इ doesn't yield the 7th case directly. If it did, we would have \*कवी, whereas actually it'sकवौ.

  

I think this is what Ganesh probably wants to know: why it's कवौ and not कवी (कवि + इ)

  

My own answer is that forms such as कवौ,सेनायाम्, etc., were in use long before a grammarian such as Panini came along. He probably found that adding इ to the noun-base took care of most of 7th case derivations. Then, to account for forms such as कवौ,सेनायाम्,etc., he created additional rules.

  

As they commonly say, my 2¢ :D
