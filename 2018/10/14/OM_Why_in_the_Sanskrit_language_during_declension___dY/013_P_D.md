सर्वेभ्यो नमस्कारः  
I am just started to learn the divine language & सुबन्तप्रकरणम् and would like to share my bit.  
To convey feeling of “inside”, “on” etc., अधिकरण and सप्तमी विभक्तिः are applicable. The forms decline in a very precise and methodical manner as under.  
सप्तमी एकवचनम् सुप् प्रत्ययः applicable will be ङि (4.1.2) and after removal of अनुबन्धः only इ will remain.

[TABLE]

In neuter Gender too, majority of the words will decline as Masculine words.  
From above I feel at the tactical level the Declination given by applications of Sutras of Maharshi Panini gives very logical and precise results.  
I would be grateful if the learned scholars, would point out any errors in above, so I could improve.  
Thanks and Regards,  
Paresh Dalal

Subject: Re: \[Samskrita\] ॐ Why, in the Sanskrit language, during declension, does the suffix word change when the ending letter of the previous word change?
