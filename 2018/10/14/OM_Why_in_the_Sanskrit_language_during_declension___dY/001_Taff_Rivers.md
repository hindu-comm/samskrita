Ganesh,

  

Those vowel changes are simply for ease of pronunciation.  

In everyday language, it's what all those rules of sandhiḥ are for.

  

If you were to say the Sanskrit letter a, and follow it with the i,

you will notice that you will have to change the shape of your mouth, your lips and move your tongue,

which makes you pause in between saying the two letters.

  

But if you blend those two vowels together as one, to make the one sound - e.

then, saying that e, straight after the r of dharmakṣetr,canbe done smoothly without theneed for oral gymnastics.

  

That is my understandingof sandhiḥ.

  

Hope this helps,

  

For your 'feeling of inside', I understand you to mean 'internal sandhiḥ'.

For 'ending letter word', I read 'initial vowel'.

For 'being suffixed', I read 'being inflected'.
