Why, in the Sanskrit language, during declension, does the suffix word change when the ending letter of the previous word change? What is the rationale behind using different sounds, to convey the same feeling, just because the ending letter changes?

The word धर्मक्षेत्रे, can be split into धर्मक्षेत्र + इ. गुण-सन्धिः आद् गुणः (6।1।87). The word इ, in this case, is used to represent, the, feeling of inside. So, my question is, why, when the ending letter is changing, the word that is being suffixed is changing, to represent the same feeling of inside?
