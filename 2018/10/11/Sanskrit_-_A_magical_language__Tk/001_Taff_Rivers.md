Ramesh,

  

 Please stop propagating falsehoods.

  

Do your own homework.

  

Your point No. 1 is false. Writtenor spoken Sanskrit is highly ambiguous. Viz. the existence of numerous commentaries to help the readerunderstand the text thatcontradicteach other.

*Generating* Sanskrit or any is done accordingtoexact rules for expressing what the writer has inmind.

  

Elephants are not an endangeredspecies. There's too many trampling aroundalready!

  

Re. your No. 5, The truth is that Rick Briggs,was speaking on a personal basis, which was not that of NASA's.

He was actually bemoaning the fact that NASA was **not** considering it.

  

And as to your No. 7. "Research is going on to make a programming language in Sanskrit which can be compiled and executed million times faster than other programming languages."

As a professional computer person, I explained in 2013, why Sanskrit is useless as a computer language.

No r*esearch* is needed, it's obvious to anyone with a little knowledge of Assembler.

  

These points were discussed in this forum way back in 2013.
