I would like to add the following regarding point#1 that sentences in Samskritam language does NOT havd positional "placement".

  

In my opinion, this is only partially true.

  

It is true only when the nouns involved in the sentences are in different vibhakti like the sentence quoted अहं उत्तरं लिखामि।

  

Suppose you take a sentence in which nouns are in the SAME vibhakti
like

  

रामस्य पुस्तकं कृष्णस्य हस्ते अस्ति।

  

Here you can not swap रामस्य & कृष्णस्य and expect the same semantic
