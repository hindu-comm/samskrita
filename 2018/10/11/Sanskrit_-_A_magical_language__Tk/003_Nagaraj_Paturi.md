Sri Ramesh-ji,

  

Many of your posts have sources elsewhere and you have been asked to mention the sources.

  

Are you inspired , by chance, by web pages like

  

**Sanskrit - the Magic Language**  

  

<http://www.whyislife.com/newsletters/sanskritMar16-2007.html> ?  

  

------------------------------------------------

  

Some of the points you made in your post are highly valid and give the impression of Sanskrit being a magical language.

  

For example, the availability of viloma kaavyas ( A kaavya conveying meaning both in the regular and reverse order of reading the letters /syllables in the language and other chitra kavitva forms , dvyarthi kaavyas (a single kaavya communicating two different narratives poetically through pun) etc. which you exemplified and explained in a popular style, without using the technical terms is part of many unique achievements in Sanskrit literature.

  

Some other aspects that you mentioned are some popular romanticisations in appreciation of Sanskrit language that do not stand scientific scrutiny.

  

When you mix up valid points with such romanticisations., valid points miss the attention and appreciation of the readers and give scope for blanket accusations and sweeping condescensions. 

  

There are better ways of expressing your love for Sanskrit sincerity of which can not be doubted.
