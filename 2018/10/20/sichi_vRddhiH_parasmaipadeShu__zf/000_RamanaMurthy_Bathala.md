Dear Sir,

This is from :

1)

THE ASHTADYAYI OF PANINI BOOK I-1891-Ed.NA-SRISA CHANDRA VASU

![1.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/959d2f51848e3/1.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)

  

The visarga(:) is वृद्धिः *vṛddhiḥ* is missing before word परस्मै *parasmai* in the above screenshot

2) From the same author at another place:

THE ASHTADYAYI OF PANINI BOOK VII-1891-Ed.NA-SRISA CHANDRA VASU

![2.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/959d2f51848e3/2.jpg?part=0.2&view=1)



Here visarga remains unchanged.

3) As per MW Grammar, Visarga remains unchanged before प *pa*.

  

![3.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/959d2f51848e3/3.jpg?part=0.3&view=1)



  

Is there any rule by which Visarga is missing in the first screenshot?

Regards

Ramana Murthy
