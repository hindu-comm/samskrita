अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम् is probably what Coulson calls a nominal sentence, i.e, a sentence with no verbs. Our sentence has 2 words and I'm guessing that it defines/introduces प्रातिपदिकम्. Thus,
प्रातिपदिकम् is its subject and अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययःis a substantive serving predicatively. According to Coulson, the substantive predicate अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः is therefore not required to agree in gender or number with प्रातिपदिकम्.

  

Coulson says that an adjective can also serve as a predicate. But then there must be agreement (number, gender, and case). In our example, अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः cannot be an adjective serving predicatively because it doesn't match the gender of प्रातिपदिकम्

  

In light of this, perhaps अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम् can be split as follows:  

  

अर्थवत् प्रातिपदिकम् &

अधातुः प्रातिपदिकम् &

अप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम्

  

I've highlighted (in bold) the relevant section in this excerpt from Coulson.  

  

Here's Coulson (delimited by \<begin> and \<end>).

*Nominal sentences*  

\<begin>

There is an important type of sentence in Sanskrit which contains no verb. Such sentences, consisting of a juxtaposition of subject and non-verbal predicate, are a feature of many Indo-Eurpoean languages. In English the type is almost lost, and when used it has a literary flavour, as in 'happy the man who...'. In Greek there are sentences like sophos ho philosophos 'the philosophers are wise'; in a song of Edith Piaf occurs 'balayees les amours' 'loves are swept away'. Regularly in such an English sentence the subject is*not*placed first. A twentieth-century poet, T.S.Eliot, can write 'dark the Sun and Moon and the Almanach de Gotha', but 'the Sun and Moon dark' would hardly have been possible. This fact distinguishes such a sentences from one simply involving an ellipse of the verb 'to be': we may say 'John is intelligent, Peter stupid'.  

  

In Sanskrit adjectives used predicatively agree in number, gender and case with their substantive, just as when used attributively. As a phrase,शीघ्रावश्वौ means 'the two swift horses'; as a complete statement, it means 'the two horses are swift'.

  

रमणीयो बालः the child is pleasant  

  

**The predicate may, however, be another substantive, and then agreement of number or gender is not necessary:**

  

स्वल्पं सुखं क्रोधः anger is a small pleasure  

  

If the subject is a pronoun and the predicate a substantive, the pronoun usually reflects the number and gender of the predicate:

  

सूर्यः सः that is the sun  

  

The predicate may also be adverbial. Thus it may consist of an adverb, or of a substantive in some other case such as the locative.

  

एवं सर्वदा सुखानि joys are ever thus  

क्व देवदत्तः Where is Devadatta?  

उद्याने देवदत्तः Devadatta is in the garden
