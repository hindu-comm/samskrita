Namaste,

  

Beginner here.. I was looking to see if any of the seniors here can point me to vibakthi tables online (would like to start the process of learning by rote). I would like to see if there were any good authoritative PDF versions out there that you might know of that I could print and carry with me..

  

Thanks very much,

  

Sunil
