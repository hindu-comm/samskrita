Dear Sir,

  

In the links provided:

  

<http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2009/06/sabda-manjari/>

<https://www.scribd.com/doc/46132803/Sabda-Manjari>

  

The above links provide the english version of Sabda Manjari. In this scanned book, the pages 36 & 37 are missing. Those two pages cover the declension of the nouns राजन् (king), आत्मन् (soul), श्वन् (dog). I have printed copy of the book. I scanned those two pages and inserted those two pages. Please find the attachment.

  

The Tamil version provide by Prof. Nagaraj Paturi sir is good one and contains all the pages without any missing.

  

I use the following online tools:

  

<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/grammar.html>

<http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/>

  

Majority of the times, the online tools gives the correct forms. Few times, I found them giving incorrect forms. Mostly they are reliable.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
