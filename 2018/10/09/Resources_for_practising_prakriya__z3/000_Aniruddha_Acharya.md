Namaste,

I'm studying tinganta and kridanta prakriya using the book 'Sheeghra-bodh-vyaakaranam' written by Dr Pushpa Deekshit. I found the book really helpful for understanding the basic techniques of prakriya, but feel that there are not enough exercises to test my understanding. I would like to apply the techniques for a lot of cases and verify if the derivations are correct. Is there some resource (online, or offline) which can help me in this? For e.g. some book that has a lot of exercises...

  

Thanks

Aniruddha
