For tinanta forms -

  

1\) Pick up any random dhatu from<http://ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/>. Click on it.

2\) Pick up any random form.

3\) Try deriving that form using whatever you have learnt.

4\) Click on the form. Prakriya will be presented. Verify the prakriya with whatever you have written.

5\) If you think there are mistakes in the prakriya on the website, use the feedback link in thr bottom right corner to contact the site owner. Or you can also file the bugs [here](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/prakriya/issues).

  

Happy derivations!

Neelesh
