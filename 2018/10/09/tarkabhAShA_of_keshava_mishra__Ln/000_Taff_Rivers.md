All,

  

Looking for a version of the ***Tarkabhāṣā of Keśava Miśra*** in its text incarnation, i.e. txt, rtf, docx. pdf &c. that enables the extraction of its content for quoting and note taking.

There is a good scanned pdf available in picture format, but I'm not been able to locate any text version.

I would be grateful for any pointers.
