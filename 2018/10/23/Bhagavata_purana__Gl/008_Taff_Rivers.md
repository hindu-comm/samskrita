Swapna,

  

 I have tried it again. Right now, (07:40 British summer time) the site is up and it downloaded OK.

Last night thesite was down...

  

BTW, as pointed out by the good Dr, it is the Gita, not the Purana, and only the first 6 chapters are there.

  

Such textsasthese are very helpful, they do take a lot of work to produce, but are hard to find.

  

They require someonewho is equally at home in Sanskrit and especially one who can take into account changes in Sanskrit vocabulary over the millenniums.

  

An up-to-date catalogue of them is sorely needed.  
  
Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
