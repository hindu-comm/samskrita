नमस्ते श्रीमन् स्वरूप-महोदय!

I am intrigued by the mention in the notes "... Panini's Asthadhyayii, composed around 600 BC, was the very first grammar in the history of human civilization. ..."

Does not Panini himself make mention of many grammarians before him ?

There have been प्रातिशाख्य-s ofdifferent वेद-s also, much before Panini, right ?

Does not then the statement become misinformation / misleading ?

I hope, the teachers will not disburse any more misinformation during the course (!)  

Beginnings of different courses is mentioned, but not the duration (?)

Will the अष्टाध्यायी-course, for example, go on and on until, not just अष्टाध्यायी, but related annexes such as गणपाठ, धातुपाठ, लिङ्गानुशासनम्, शिक्षा are all covered, since they also ought to be covered ?

Maybe, the teachers do have in mind, the scopes of the syllabi. It would be good, if these are informed in advance.
