Sir, you seriously think that the teacher who is teaching these subjects is unaware of the above or is deliberately misrepresenting things? Your objection is ill-spirited or at least clumsy. A writer I admire (NN Taleb) once said: "You can attack what a person \*said\* or what the person \*meant\*. The former is more sensational. The mark of a charlatan is to defend his position or attack a critic by focusing on \*some\* of his/her specific statement ("look at what he said") rather than attacking his position ("look at what he means"), the latter of which requires a broader knowledge of the proposed idea.""
