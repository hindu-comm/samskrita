नमस्ते श्रीमन् विश्वास-महोदय !

I am sorry, if language of my message has offended anybody.

Actually I worded my message, with many interrogatives, not making any charge.

Why should interrogatives become offensive ?

If the concerned persons have the answers, they can answer, right ?

Also I sincerely think that the points I have put forth are valid, especially seeking that the duration of the course and the scope of the syllabus should be declared, importantly, for a course onपाणिनि.

Is it also correct to say thatपाणिनि's was the "first ever" grammar ? Isn't that misinformation ?

I have known of instances, where courses become attractive just by the mention of the name ofपाणिनि. I have also known that people have paid for the courses and have felt frustrated in due course. Such frustration happening will prove disservice to the cause of Sanskrit. That must not happen is my basic intent.
