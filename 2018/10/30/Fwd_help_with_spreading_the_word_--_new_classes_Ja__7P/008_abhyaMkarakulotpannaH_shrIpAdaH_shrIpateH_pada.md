This is further to my earlier response to the message posted by Mr. विश्वासो वासुकिजः forwarding message received by him from Mr. Swarup about the courses starting in Jan. 2019.

I had some aspersions about the course on पाणिनीयम् व्याकरणम्.

Now after interaction with Mr. Swarup, I get to know the following =>

The contents of the course, including the topics therein are to be read in the left column of<https://sites.google.com/site/samskritavyakaranam/>  

1.  As can be seen bold items 01 to 09 (including 2A and 7A) are about
    पाणिनीयम् व्याकरणम् 2.  Bold item 10 is aboutन्यायशास्त्रम्, for which also a separate
    course is announced.

Every item and sub-item in the left column is an hyperlink. By clicking on any item or sub-item, one gets to browse through the contents of the item. Downloading all those items and sub-items will make the course-material.

The course. proceeds batch-wise. The announcement of the course to begin in Jan. 2019 is really an announcement of starting of a new batch. Once delineation of the course for a new batch has started, it will be difficult to admit new entrants/aspirants in-between, because the new entrant/aspirant will have too much to catch up with.

The course is conducted at the appointed times using "conference call" medium.

If more information is needed, one may write to Mr. Swarup, whose email ID was there in his message to Mr. विश्वासो वासुकिजः and forwarded to the group by Mr. विश्वासो वासुकिजः
