Once you register for the class, we'll add your email into the google groups for the class so you receive the weekly class announcement.  
  
Feel free to spread the word about these classes to your friends and family, as well as to forward this email and post it on other Samskrita email lists.  
  
We don't start new vargas very often, so this is a great opportunity to get in at the beginning of vargas in these foundational subjects. Further description of the classes is found below.  
  
  
*Class Descriptions*  
  
1. Paniniiya Vyakaranam  
  
Timing: Wednesdays 9:00 - 10:30 pm EST  
Medium: Conference Call  
Teacher: Vidhya Bhagini  
  
Panini's Asthadhyayii, composed around 600 BC, was the very first grammar in the history of human civilization. It is a masterful work of linguistics which has never since been equaled, and continues today to be the linguistics gem of the entire world. Here is an opportunity to study Panini's grammar directly in Samskritam.  
  
We will begin at the very beginning of Paniniiya Vyakaranam, and move ahead in a sequence and fashion which is easy for all. Every year many people try to learn Shastriiya Vyakaranam through study of Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudhi (LSK), and end up leaving the study because of how difficult it seems. But we are here to say that it only seems difficult because LSK is not organized in a logical way. Just one example: After teaching लट्‌ it moves to लिट्‌, while the two have nothing in common; there are many such issues which make LSK difficult. Common subjects should be taught together, and then everything becomes easy! Smt Puspa Dixit's method is logical and is based in Panini's own approach. As a result, it is easy for everyone to follow along and master the subject. When it comes to Paniniiya Vyakaranam, advanced and beginner students of Samskrtam are all on equal footing-- so everyone is welcome! All you need is basic knowledge of spoken Samskritam, and a desire to learn.  
  
Review sessions will be occurring on Thursdays 9:00 - 10:30 pm EST.  
Teacher: Bhavya Bhagini

2. Nyaya Shastram  
  
Timing: Saturdays 11:30 am - 1:00 pm EST  
Medium: Conference Call  
Teacher: Raksha Bhagini  
  
Repeat session: Mondays 9:00 - 10:30 pm EST  
Teacher: Jayanti Bhagini  
  
Nyaya Shastram is, together with Shastriiya Vyakaranam, considered the foundation for study of Samskritam in Gurukulams and Universities throughout India. This has indeed been the classical tradition for hundreds of years. Yet in the modern Samskrita Universities, the traditional method for teaching this Nyaya is tough to follow. As a result, after students complete the one year Nyaya requirement, most choose to major in other subjects like Samskrita literature. But as with Paniniiya Vyakaranam, most of the perceived difficulty is due to a teaching methodology which makes the subject seem far more tough than it really is. A new Nyaya text-- Vidyadharii -- makes Nyaya readily accessible and easy to follow through the use of a pictorial approach. Concepts which have traditionally seemed tough and obscure, now become lucid and simply through the use of pictures. Join us and see how it works!

3. Sandhi+ (Giita Pravesha part I)  
  
Timing: Saturdays 9:00 - 10:30 am EST  
Medium: Conference Call  
Teacher: Subrahmanya Mahodaya  
  
We will study practical grammatical structures as presented in Giita Pravesha part I. We will supplement this by teaching fundamental aspects of Paniniiya Vyakaranam, which makes learning Sandhi, Natvam, and other related subjects easy! See how easy it is to learn visarga sandhi, ac-sandhi, and hal-sandhi when you learn the sutras that go with them. An extraordinary feature of this bhAShAvarga, join in and see how Panini's sutras make mastering vyakaranam simple and fun!  
  
Review session: Fridays 8:00 - 9:30 pm EST  
Teacher: Subrahmanya Mahodaya
