Mr Abhyankar doesn't strike me as someone even in the remotest  
vicinity of being ill-spirited. True, the actual argument he offered  
could have been stronger, but I clicked on the links supplied by the  
course organisers, and I'm not sure that responsible scholars would  
agree with everything there. Perhaps that's what Mr Abhyankar picked  
up on when he wrote his response.
