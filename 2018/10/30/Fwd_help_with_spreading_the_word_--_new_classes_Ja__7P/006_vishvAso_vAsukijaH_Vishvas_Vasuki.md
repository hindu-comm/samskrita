Really? What should one make of the following words - "I hope, the teachers will not disburse any more misinformation during the course (!)"?  
  
Quoting shrI svarUpa - " To write with accusations of misleading misinformation, casting our course in a negative light without having ever examined it yourself, is unnecessary and not in the spirit of collective welfare. "

What if I asked you: "I hope you didn't beat your wife today?"

Is it correct to say: "कुन्ताः प्रविशन्ति" given that spears don't move by themselves? Or "गङ्गायाम् गोष्ठः" given that there can be no गोष्ठ in the middle of a river? Is it too much to ask to take laxaNArtha when vAchyArtha wont do?  

  

Nevertheless if you wanted to question and suggest better phrasing, that would have been appropriate.
