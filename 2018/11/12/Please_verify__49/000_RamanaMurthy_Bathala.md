Dear sir,

  

Please see the mark on the screenshot. It seems it is four consonant conjunct.

I find difficult it to read and pronounce.![a.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/3adf24763ff06/a.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)

I transliteratedas : अदण्ड्ढ्वम् *adaṇḍḍhvam*  

  

Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
