Dear list,

  

Apparently thereâ€™s a book called

# Subodh-Samskrtam (Easy Way to Sanskrit) (Sanskrit and Hindi Text with Transliteration and English Translation). I have trouble locating it, both in physical and electronic version. If you know how to get it, please reply.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
