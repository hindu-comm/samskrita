Irene,

  

At the time of my post there was only your query. But for some strange reason, that post of mine got delayed in cyberspace.

  

Whatever. When your book arrives, let us know the print quality, but more importantly please provide a critical review of its value to the proverbial intelligent*reader*, given that it aninstruction manual aimed at classroom*teachers*, well informedor otherwise.

I have personalknowledge of a schoolheadmaster, no less, that teaches chess, and rules that it is illegal to castle on the king's side!

  

*Regards,*
