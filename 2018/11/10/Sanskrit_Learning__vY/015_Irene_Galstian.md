By the way, if anyone knows of a place I could buy the Hindi version of Jijnasu’s textbook, please tell me. The currently circulating scan is rather grainy, and I’d like to both have the original work and to create a better scan for others. Unfortunately, the Hindi physical book is proving very hard to find. I’m talking about the textbook here, not his 3 volume Hindi commentary, which I managed to find in the end.

  

Many thanks,

Irene
