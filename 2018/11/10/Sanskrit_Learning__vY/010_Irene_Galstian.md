Hard to disagree there. If we rely on transliteration, we're cutting  
ourselves off from a large chunk of scholarship in that language.  
Jijnasu's book is useful, and one might find that it merits longer  
study than the 15 minutes allocated to it by Taff. However, for  
someone who's been through an MA in Sanskrit and SK it might be too  
easy.
