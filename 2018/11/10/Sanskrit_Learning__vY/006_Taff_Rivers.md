Ja,

  

Regarding *The Tested Easiest Method of Learning & Teaching Sanskrit*.

  

Caveat emptor!

  

You will need to know Hindi, to get any benefit.

  

Yes, the explanation is in English, but what is being explained is only given in Hindi, in nagari.

Not a single Sanskrit word is transliterated, not in the contents pages, not in the index pages.

  

 I have a hard copy of The Tested Easiest Method of Learning & Teaching Sanskrit, 7th Edition. 1982

The original is 60 years old. The original and subsequent amended editions may well have been 'easiest' in them days.

  

Thus it turns out to be completely useless to anyone such as myself who no more knows their Hindi than their Mandarin.

  

Here is a sample. Even if it is meaningful to you, remember that authors and publishers are sellers. So, first ask existing buyers how much time they took.

For myself, 15 minutes!
