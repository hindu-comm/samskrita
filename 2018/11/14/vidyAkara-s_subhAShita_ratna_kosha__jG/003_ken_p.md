The first edition of this anthology of Sanskrit court poetry was prepared shortly before the year 1100 of our era by a Buddhist scholar named Vidvakara, who drew for his purpose on what must have been a large library housed in the monastery of Jagaddala. The ruins of Jagaddala may still be seen in Malda District a few miles east of the present border between West and East Bengal. A second edition of the anthology, increased in size by about one-third, was made some years later, doubtÂ¬ less by Vidvakara himself. Of each edition only a single complete manuscript has been preserved. It was from photographs of these two manuscripts that D. D. Kosambi and V. V. Gokhale were able to edit the Sanskrit text of Vidyakara's anthology as Volume 42 of the Harvard Oriental Series in 1957...............
