Dear Taff,

  

I think great grammarian Bhanuji Dikshita who commented and gave the derivation I have given seems to be a beginner for the word स्वर्ग and yourself a great grammarian.

  

स्वृ itself becomes an indeclinable word as स्वर् synonymous to स्वर्ग and गम् would give along with स्वर् dervining स्वर्ग meaning one who goes to स्वर्ग and not as you think shines and goes. I shall be obliged if you can explain how did you derive to get the meaning in Sanskrit grammatical process. I need not your comparative philology and the meaning. Sorry I do not have any despise for Comparative Philology or any western gramarian.
