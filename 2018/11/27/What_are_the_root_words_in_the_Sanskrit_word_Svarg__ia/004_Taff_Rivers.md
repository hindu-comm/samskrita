hh,

  

 Svarga.

  

1. *svarga* Is a single word.

2.. devoid of any context - the original questioner has had the importance of *context*, pointed out to him/her on more that one occasion

and bya number of people.

  

3\. Grammar is a technical subject, having specialist terminology.

  

On its own, svargais ambiguous.

  

As well as being understood to be employed as a noun.

it also very much used an adjective.

  

which can be decomposed as svar+ ga.

  

4. Root is requested.

 dhātu - grammatical or verbal root

  

So, as a decomposed adjective:  

  

svarga

• (or suvarga), mfn. *going or leading to or being in light or heaven*, heavenly, celestial (with loka m. or pl. = 'the world of light, heavens'), AV. &c. &c.

  

tracing its dhātu-gaṇa per:

  

2\. svar

• (prob. = a lost √ *sur*; cf. √ svṛ), cl. 1. P. svarati, Caus. svarayati, to shine. \[1281,1\]

  

  

You say: "स्वृ itself becomes an indeclinable word as स्वर् "

but do not justify that assertion. *An adverb*, according to who?  

  

Again, surely *comparative philology* of Sanskrit itself is of the utmost importance.

Like which Sanskrit? Whose Sanskrit?

  

In general, words are common to all.

Their meanings exist in the mind of the individual.

  

As to *whose meanings* is to be accepted as the definitive one?

Yours or mine or this lexicographer or that one.

In such matters, we can but agree to disagree.

  

It's up to the individualto decide, Is it not.

  

\- And he's not here.

  

This individual provides an alternative meaning.

  

Regards,

  

Guru Taff Rivers.
