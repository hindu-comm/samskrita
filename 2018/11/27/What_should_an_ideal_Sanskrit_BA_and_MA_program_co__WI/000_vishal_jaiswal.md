Namaste, I am very much a beginner in Sanskrit, though I have finally reached that stage in life where I know with certainty that I must acquire native fluency in Sanskrit.  
  
Paper degrees cum certificates are not important to me, but I see no harm in getting those along the path to fluency.  
  
I was looking at the syllabus of various programs, and the question (mentioned in the subject line) came to mind.  
  
Different people will have different perspectives, and I would like everyone, especially the sanskrit scholars, to voice their opinion in this thread, such that I have a fair overview about various components, and can then self-learn what I find to be important (which might either be missing from the chosen program, or which would be a good prerequisite to satisfy), before formally embarking on the paper degree trail.  
  
Here is a rough outline providing the context for my interests -  
1. Fluency in spoken sanskrit  
2. Ability to read general (laukika?) sanskrit without resorting to analysis/translation for the most part.  
3. Ability to write in sanskrit (eg creative writing)  
4. Applying the above mentioned reading skills to go through the Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata, puranas.  
5. Ability to understand the following vedangas/darshanas along with their commentaries.  
Yoga  
Sankhya  
Ayurveda  
  
Looking forward to your replies,  
Vishal
