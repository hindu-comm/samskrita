Thanks for the inputs. I have gone through it before and couldn't find the same. Where as I have subscribed to a monthly magazine called Sri Bhuvaneswari Vijayam published from Pudukkottai. It contains his Lalitha Sahasranamam explanation every month (they cover 2 - 3 Nama every month).

  

If someone has some idea, may please help.

  

Dhanyavadah...
