Namaste,

  

The publications page at the website on Goda Sastyji doesn't mention a book on LSN.

<http://godasastry.in/book-articles/>

  

His Tamil discourses on LSN and other scriptures are available online at this website.  

<http://godasastry.in/discources/#tantram_Lalita_Sahasranamam/>

  

regards  
shankara
