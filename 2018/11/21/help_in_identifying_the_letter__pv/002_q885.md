I'm pretty sure that is "श्लु"("ślu"). Just as in श्री, the श् can take that form. Most computer fonts don't render it that way but it is just as acceptable.

  

If I'm not mistaken, "ślu" represents elision (adarśana) by 1.1.61. It is used in sūtra 6.1.10 and probably others and I believe it has something to do with reduplication.  
  
Those with more knowledge than me should correct me if I am wrong.
