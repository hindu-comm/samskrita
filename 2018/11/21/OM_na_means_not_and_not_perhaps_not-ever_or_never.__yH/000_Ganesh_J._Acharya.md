ॐ  
  
I notice at places, the word "**na"**has been translated as not, and it has been translated even as"**never (not-ever)**" as well.  
  
**Not** and **Not-ever** convey two different contexts.

  

Until and unless **not-ever** is explicitly expressed in Sanskrit, I guess people should not translate them as**not-ever.  
**  
Looking for your opinions on this matter.  
  
Suppose, I need to tell a child not to eat sweets, since sweets are not good for health, I will set rules for the child stating.  
  
"Not to eat sweets.".  
  
but since I also knows sweets in limited quantity is necessary for health as well, I will also not set the rule.  
  
"Never eat sweets".  
  

For example a very pivotal rule of Dharma from Brhaspati has been translated using the word **"never"**  
  
**na** tat parasya saṁdadhyāt pratikūlaṁ yad ātmanaḥ.  
eṣa saṁkṣepato dharmaḥ kāmād anyaḥ pravartate.

-   One should **never** do that to another which one regards as
    **injurious** to one’s own self. This, in brief, is the rule
    of[dharma](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dharma "Dharma").Other
    behavior is due
    to[selfish](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Selfish "Selfish")[desires](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Desires "Desires").

  

Here we can see**na** is used in Sanskrit, but translated as Never. Here the translation should have contained only a **not**. Since, a righteous war at times need to be conducted.  
  
Also the wordpratikūlaṁtranslates as unfavorable. Injury is only one type ofunfavorable aspect. Ifunfavorable is not literally used, a large permutation of possibilities gets overlooked.
