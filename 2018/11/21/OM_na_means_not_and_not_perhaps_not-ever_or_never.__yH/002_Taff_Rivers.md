Ganesh and the good Dr,

  

 In the Sanskrit-English MW, you will find:

  

**1. mā**

  • ind. (casting a following ch to be changed to cch, Pāṇ. 6-1, 74) not, that not, lest, would that not, ṚV. &c. &c.

  • ***a particle of prohibition or negation***, most commonly joined with the Subjunctive i.e. the augmentless form of a past tense (esp.

   oftheaor., e.g. mā_no_vadhīr_indra, ***do not slay us***, O Indra, ṚV.; mā_bhaiṣīḥ or mā_bhaiḥ, ***do not be afraid***, MBh.

**                . . .**

    \[804,1\]

  

  

So, you would say**mā + '*too many sweets*'.**

**  
**

Another example**mā+ '*ask silly questions*'.**

  

Regards,
