Monier Williams ha to say this:  
NEVER ,*adv.*न कदाचित्, न कदापि, न कदाचन, न कर्हिचित्, न जातु,न जातुचित्,

sometimes expressed byन;as, ‘there neverhas been and never will be any one like him,’अनेन सदृशःकश्चिन् न भूतो न भविष्यति.

VS Apte doesn't opine this:

never\[Cologne record ID=7083\]\[Printed book page[306](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AEScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=306)\]  
**Never,***adv.*न कदाचित्, न कदापि, न

कदाचन, न जातु, न कर्हिचित्;‘n.-fading’

अजर;‘n.-failing’अमोघ, अक्षय्य;‘n.

more’न भूयः, नेतःपरं, न पुनः.  
  
Depends upon the context it can be translated to give emphasis.
