You are making a fundamental mistakes over here in all your assumptions. You are confusing between the letters that undergo transformation, and sounds that those letters represent.

  

For example, in शम्भु+ इ, it is important to realize that this is not a random "इ". For example, "शम्भु+ इति" does not make "शम्भौति" or whatever. This इ is called a "प्रत्यय" which is being combined with the anga "शम्भु". And in this process, before you can actually do a sandhi here, certain other rules get executed, like अच्च घे and others which cause some other transformations on those letters. These specific rules of combinations have nothing (or very little) to do with how these words are written or pronounced or whatever. It has nothing to do with your or any other software. It is a rule of grammar that we follow.

  

It may feel "non-intuitive" or "illogical" to you because of the way you look at it - considering them as sounds being combined, rather than understanding the shastra behind it.  

  

For those who have studied this field systematically, it is as natural as a rule of physics.
