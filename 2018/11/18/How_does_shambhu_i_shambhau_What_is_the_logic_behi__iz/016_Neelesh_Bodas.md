There is no encoding decoding going on here. The saptami ekvachan of शम्भु has always been शम्भौ - That's how the language is. Nothing is encoded. This is no different than saying that Past tense of "go" is "went" (just an analogy).

  

What Panini did was create a system which could give a systematic derivation / generation of शम्भौ starting with शम्भु. This is a system of rules that he has created which ws call "Ashtadhyayi". Again, very similar to rules of mathematics (just an analogy).

  

So this all boils down to two questions -

  

1\) Are you saying that the fact that saptami ekvachan of शम्भु being शम्भौ is non intuitive?

2\) Are you saying that Panini's style of converting शम्भु to शम्भौ is non intuitive?

  

Once we know what is the exact question, experts here can help in a better way, I guess.
