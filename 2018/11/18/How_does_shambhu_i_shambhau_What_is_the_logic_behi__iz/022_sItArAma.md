OP - "Is Sanskrit a secret encoded language, which has formulas to decode it?"

There is lot of fancy surrounding Sanskrit, instead of learning like any other language it was thoroughly mystified for people. Once it was a normal conversational language across Bharat.  

  

I will take English analogy to explain and see if it makes sense.  

One who drives = Driver

One who teaches = teacher  

One who sings = Singer  

But one who cooks = is not cooker, it is cook.  

Driver, teacher singer, painter, .... cook. If you take all these words and observe, then you see a common pattern, There is "ER" in the end except for Cook and there is action in the front. One can make a quick observation and there is a sufffix and there is something in the front for convenience we can call it Prakriti. Because when you bring tense the same changes to different forms. Sing - Sang, Drive - Drove, Teach - Taught, Cook - Cooked. You get the idea.  

  

Panini in his time studied Vedas thoroughly and at the time the conversational language was Sanskrit so he was well versed with that as well. He looked at all the words and found various patterns.He reverse engineered it from words, he imagined Prakriti Pratyaya split and created the rules. An incredible achievement of human mind.  

These patterns he put in a various meta rules that we all know as Panini Ashtadhyayi - Reading plain Ashtadhyayi or any other works of Panini, like a novel will not make you expert at anything.  

  

Developing basic understanding of various texts and its significance from teachers is far better than relying on a software.  

Remember the saying for software "Garbage in garbage out"  

my 2 cents
