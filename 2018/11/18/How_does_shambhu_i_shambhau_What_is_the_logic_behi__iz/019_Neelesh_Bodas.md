Why does the person need to "practically realize" that there is anइ suffixed? Put differently, what are the "practical benefits" in realizing that there wasइ suffixed by Panini ?

  

Nothing.Only who want to study Ashtadhyayi need to know that Panini puts anइ there. And for them it is perfectly logical because they know rules like अच्च घे and others.

  

Rest of the world (= non-students of Ashtadhyayi) don't need this knowledge, and they shouldn't care.

  

Not knowing there there isइ suffixed in "शम्भौ" neither stops anyone nor aids anyone in understanding meaning ofशम्भौ or using it in their own language. It does NOT make anyone a less expert in the language.

  

Less expert of grammar? Definitely. But again, that's different.
