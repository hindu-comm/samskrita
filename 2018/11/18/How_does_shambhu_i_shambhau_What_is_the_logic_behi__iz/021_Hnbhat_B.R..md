In reply to my message, he referred to TTS software running अ+इ= ऐ and he calls jt intuitive "As, when I speed up the TTS software अ + इ sounds ऐ". So he calls all the wrong vowel formations his software gives as such and all the correct formations according to grammar as non-intuitive that don't conform to tbe formation given by his software.

I said due to operation of the rule the उ becomes अ, and इ becomes औ, further joined as अ+औ=औ. He still sticks to his software gives अ+इ=औ. Funny thing. I think he is referred to some Text to speech software for दैवनागरी.

  

Let me ask him what intitution gave him that there is suffix इ in सप्तमी एकवचनम् like in रामे, हरौ, शम्भौ etc. for which he is arguing? Is it by
intitution or by the rule given Panini saying it as इ. Anyhow be is not going to learn Sanskrit language or Grammar by intitution only. Simply arguing for argument sake and nothing more to be achieved by our discussion. Panini says ङि वव ओस् सुप् only as locative case suffixes. None of these formations could not be derived from these suffixes with the TSS software he uses, It seems software gives मति+ इ=मती and never will give मतौ, मत्याम्।
