When I say nothing is encoded, what I meant was -there is no hidden इ insideशम्भौ.

  

It is Panini who created a system and said that "In my system, the way to generate शम्भौ from शम्भु is to add the pratyay इ".

  

Panini does NOT say that in Sanskrit languageशम्भौ has an encodedइ inside it. What he says is that "my system has a rule that says शम्भु+ इ = शम्भौ",

  

It is perfectly possible that someone creates another system, and says - "In my system, the way to generate शम्भौ from शम्भु is to add the different pratyay, say "अ" (or whatever).

  

I guess most of you confusion will go away if you grasp the difference between "langauge" and "a system of grammar for its validation".They are not the same.
