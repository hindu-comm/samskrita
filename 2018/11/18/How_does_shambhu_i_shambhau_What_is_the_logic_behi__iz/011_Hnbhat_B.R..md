Well said Panini did not create words of language or language. It was there since Vedic times and he has only formed rules to identify correct forms and incorrect forms.

  

Under the Varttika सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे, it is said

तथाहि कश्चिद्घटेन कार्यं करिष्यन्‌ कुलालकुलं गत्वा ब्रवीति कुरु घटमनेन कार्यं करिष्यामीति। न तथा शब्दान्‌ प्रयुङ्क्षमाणो वैयाकरणकुलं गत्वा हि कुरु शब्दान्‌ प्रयोक्ष्य इति। तं तमेवार्थमुपादाय शब्दान्‌ प्रयुञ्जते।
