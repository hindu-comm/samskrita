Ganesh,

  

**śambhau** is the masculine, locative singular of **śambhu**.

It is an inflection, as listed in given tables.

  

These tables were designed by unknown Indian grammarians of yore, to serve vocalisations.

They appear to have been derived from the saṃdhi concept - the intuitive ease of pronunciation.

Where extra rules were needed to provide for those inflections that go by the name of *vowel gradation*.

  

As to the reasoning behind this vowel gradation scheme, this is a missing link, but it's not too difficult to speculate,

after a view of the short table of said gradations.

  

Language is approached by first learning to speak, then learning to write (not essential - many do not), then the grammar.

  

==>

Is Sanskrit a secret encoded language, which has formulas to decode it?  

==>

  

Sanskrit is the media of communication *to* the gods. One can only appeal - in words. The response does not come in words.

  

No formula needed, just a large amount of common-sense.

  

Hope this helps,

  

Taff Rivers
