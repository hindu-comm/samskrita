That is another misunderstanding. Panini hasn't created any language. The language existed before him. He has created "rules" that can distinguish incorrect forms of the language from the correct forms. Please note that "शम्भु+ इ --> ... --> शम्भौ" is a rule of Paninian grammar. It has nothing to do with the actual usage or meaning of the word शम्भौ. For example, you can create your own grammar by saying
"शम्भु minus उ plus औ= शम्भौ" or whatever, and that would still be correct (assuming your grammar becomes as great as Panini's).

  

If your question / argument is whether "Sanskrit language is intuitive or non-intuitive", then picking up "शम्भु+ इ" as an example and questioning rules of Ashtadhyayi is not the right direction. Ashtadhyayi does not create the language. It creates the rules to capture existing language.

  

You may then ask, "are rules in Ashtadhyayi non intuitive" ? But then that's altogether a different topic.
