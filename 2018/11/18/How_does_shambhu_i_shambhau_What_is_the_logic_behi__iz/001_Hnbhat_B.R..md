No secret in Sanskrit language and it is not following your logic. But it follows the rules and logic of Panini who wrote grammar rules. If you are a beginner, and not able to follow the rules of grammer, please follow the readymade forms available online instead of following your own logic. Otherwise you have to learn the rules of grammar of Sanskrit and fo!low his logic to understand the changes.

  

Under the question, you have two parallels:

शम्भु + इ = शम्भौ. Here in both places, previous vowels become अ and following vowel इ becomes changed to औ due to the operation of the ruleअच्च घेः. Thus:

हर+औ = हरौ; शम्भ + औ = शम्भौ.

Then it is like राम+औ. In all the three, the two vowels get changed into one औ due to the operation of the rule of Sandhi वृद्धिरेचि. All become हरौ, शम्भौ, रामौ.

  

Please look into how मुनौ is derived in the following link with the meaning of the rule of changes given both in English and Sanskrit:
