"due to the operation of the ruleअच्च घेः"  

  

Lets look at that carefully.

"अ and following vowel इ becomes changed to औ"  
  

Now logically when the sounds अ + इ should have soundedऐ, but then only when a non-intuitive rule is used, we due to the rule arrive at औ. That seems fine with encoding and decoding using a particular rule "अच्च घे". But if intuitive, it should have been ऐ rationally. As, when I speed up the TTS software अ + इ sounds ऐ.

  

Just brainstorming. So that I am reach and understand the precise thinking that Panini or a previous grammarian had when creating this language and its grammar.
