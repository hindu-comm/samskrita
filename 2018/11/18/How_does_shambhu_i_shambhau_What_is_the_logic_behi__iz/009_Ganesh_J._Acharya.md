Not at all. If I purposely create a non-intuitive language to only circulate documents among chosen people, it is perfectly logical to create such a language. This is how encoding and decoding must be done.  

  

Again, all this I am hypothesizing for now. May be all this is perfectly intuitive, and I am missing the logical link.
