If a person forgets the rules, or if a person does not study the rule, how will he practically realize there is anइ suffixed?  
  
In English we simply have "Ganesh in". Here in this case there is no need to recollect or study formuations?  
  
If the word wasशम्भ्वि instead, a person can intuitively realize there is anइ suffixed. Where as, because of the rules, such does not happen.  
  
If I need to create an encoding decoding system, I will obviously create non-intuitive rules and regulations.  
  
If i need to create an encoding decoding system, even within English language itself, I will do something similar to what Panini has done so that I can easily teach the encoding decoding system to others by giving a rule list to follow. While I will use English language itself, since people already are familiar with it.
