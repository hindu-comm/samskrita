This does not seem to be intuitive, because if the two ending sounds are combined, then the combined pronounciation does not come out asशम्भु + इ = शम्भौ.  
  
So, I wonder what is the logic behind doing such.  
  
It seems a student has to be practically taught doing such.  
That makes the language non intuitive.

  

The logic that I understand is, perhaps Sanskrit is a secret language which a person or a student understands if he is practically taught a teacher knowing the language.  
  
Kindly let me know if the thinking in going in the right lines.

  

Is Sanskrit a secret encoded language, which has formulas to decode it?  
Was it mean to be that way?
