Ganesh,

  

 More on***gradation***as a means of indicating grammatical information, including case inflection:

  

In linguistics, apophony (also known as ablaut, (vowel) ***gradation***, (vowel) mutation, alternation, internal modification, stem modification, stem alternation, replacive morphology, stem mutation, internal inflection etc.) ***is any sound change within a word that indicates grammatical information (often inflectional).***

  

Apophony is exemplified in English as the internal vowel alternations (i***nternal sandhi***) that produce such related words as

s**i***n*g, s**a**ng, s***u***ng, s**o**ng

r*i*se, r***o***se, r***i***sen

  

The same concept applies to Sanskrit.
