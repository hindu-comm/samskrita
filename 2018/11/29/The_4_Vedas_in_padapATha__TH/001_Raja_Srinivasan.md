I know of two sources for the Vedas:



1.  Vedic Reserve in Maharishi Univerisity of Management.
    <http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/>. 2.  The entire Rg Veda has been recited by mandala by Aurobindo Ashram
    in Russia. One can access it here:
    <https://www.aurobindo.ru/workings/matherials/rigveda/index.htm>.
    This is what I am using to learn to recite the Rg Veda.



Regards

Raja
