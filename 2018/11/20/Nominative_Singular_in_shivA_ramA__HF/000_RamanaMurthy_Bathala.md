Dear Sir,

  

Please observe only the markings (to save time) on the screenshot.

शिवा (f.) = Wife of Lord Siva

Nom. Sing: शिवा + स् = शिवा *śivā + s = śivā* (स् *s* is rejected)

  

रमा (f.) = Goddess Lakshmi

Nom. Sing: रमा + स् = रमा *ramā + s = ramā* (स् *s* is rejected)

  

Why is स् *s* being rejected in feminine stems ending in आ *ā*? Is there any Panini’s rule being applied here?

But this स् *s* is not being rejected in Masculine stem ending in आ *ā*.
