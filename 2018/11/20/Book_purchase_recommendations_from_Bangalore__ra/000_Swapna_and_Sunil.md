Dear teachers,

  

I had a quick question for you - I have the benefit of visiting Bangalore India for a short time next month and wanted to see if I can also use this visit to see if I can purchase some essential Samskrta works/texts from Bangalore.

  

I consider myself an absolute beginner in the study of Samskrta. To this end, it will be nice if you can send me recommendations on a core set of books that any beginner needs to have on their shelf.

  

While I understand that many of these books might be scanned online, I am one of those old fashioned types who function better with the physical book - how quaint.. ha ha. Plus I like to collect books too..

  

So looking for recommendations for books in the following categories:

\- Samskrta grammar

\- learning Samskrta fundamentals

\- understanding Gita grammar

\- important Samskrta plays that one might need for a book collection

\- recommended Samskrta dictionary 

  

Any other relevant recommendations most welcome!!

  

Thanks very much in advance,

  

Sunil
