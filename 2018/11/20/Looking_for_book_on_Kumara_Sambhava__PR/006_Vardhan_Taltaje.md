If you are looking for translation in Kannada, there is a book by Dr. Y.S. Gayatri, but it covers 5th sarga only. It gives anvaya, simple translation and explanation in Kannada of each shloka and a section at end that gives vyakarana details. You can check bookshops like Vedanta Bookhouse in Bangalore for it, but not sure if copies would be available now as it was published in the year 2010. If you want, I can email you the contact details of the publisher and the author so that you can contact them.
