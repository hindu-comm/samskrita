Namo namah,

  

Can our scholars of the group guide me if there is any book on Kshatriya and Vaishya Ahnika Kanda and their Shodasha Samaskaras. Also I want to know if Kshatriya / Vaishya Gayatri upadesha during their upanayana is different, also is their Sandhyavandana, other Nitya karma anushtana little different ?... I am unable to find any Book of Kshatriya or Vaishya Dharma Sangraham. Kindly help me.

  

Namo namaha.

  

Ravishankar
