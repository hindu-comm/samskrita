वच परिभाषणे is the verb. But in English, there are two speeches, direct and Indirect speech. In direct speech, say or said is used, while in Indirect Speech told, asked or ordered are used differently according to context. Hence it is due to English grammar, different words are used. But in Sanskrit, there is no difference in the meaning of the verb.
