Respected scholars

Bhagavad-Gita 1st sloka-- dhritharashtra uvacha,

Dharmakshetre.....

  

The king is asking a question,

  

so uvacha,

  

does the word uvacha has a meaning ask? I thought the word meaning is 'said'. 2nd sloka-- Sanjay uvacha also has the same word, Sanjay said-- Dhrishtva Tu...

  

Both the slokas use the same word 'uvacha', one is asking and the other saying. Dhritharashtra asking a question and Sanjay answering to it. Pl clear my doubt.

I will be v grateful.
