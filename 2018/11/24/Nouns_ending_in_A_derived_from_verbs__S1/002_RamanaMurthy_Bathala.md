Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for reply.

  

When I have gone through Max Muller's book, both masculine and feminines have exactly same declension forms in all the cases and numbers.

  

This is only case where I have seen both masculine and feminine having the same forms in all cases and numbers.  

Here is the screen shot.

Related to other thread, please note that even Max Muller is using Anusvara instead of Anunasika inशङ्खध्मा*śaṅkhadhmā* in above screenshot.

  

Regards

Ramana Murthy
