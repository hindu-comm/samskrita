Dear Sir,

I am preparing notes. I need your help.

Request you to observe only the red markings on the screenshots to save time and not getting distracted.

  

1) THE ASHTADYAYI OF PANINI BOOK VI-1891-Ed.NA-SRISA CHANDRA VASU

![1.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/9d26e23ef2c13/1.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)

  

In the screenshot, the marked one reads ङ्याप्भ्यः *ṅyāpbhyaḥ*.

But I expected it to be ङ्याब्भ्यः *ṅyābbhyaḥ.*

Is there any typo or is it due to Some rule?

2) From

THE ASHTADYAYI OF PANINI BOOK VI-1891-Ed.NA-SRISA CHANDRA VASU

From KASIKAA VRITTI

![3.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/9d26e23ef2c13/3.jpg?part=0.3&view=1)



In both the above screenshots, the marked word is वर्त्तते *varttate*.

But in the web site <http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/6/1/68>, I find वर्तते *vartate* Which is correct?

3) It is Sri Srisa Vasu’s book it is अर्थवत *arthavata* where as in in the website [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com) it is अर्थवत् *arthavat*. Is there any typo in the book?
