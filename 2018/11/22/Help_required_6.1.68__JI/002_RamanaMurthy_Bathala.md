Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for the reply. Most of the doubts are cleared. Only a little bit doubt on the part of हलन्ताद् -> हलन्तान्.

I think *द्* d becomes न् *n* due to the below rule.

![11.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/9de652eb5faac/11.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)

  

हलन्ताद् + ङ् = हलन्तान् + ङ्

*halantād* + *ṅ* = *halantān* + *ṅ* (IAST)

  

  

Regards
