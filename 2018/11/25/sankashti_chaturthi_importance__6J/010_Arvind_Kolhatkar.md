The Vrata, commonly called in Maharashtra asसंकष्टी चतुर्थी. has been described by MM PV Kane at p. 435 in his History of Dharmashastra Vol V Pt 1. According to this entry, it falls on the 4th tithi of the dark half of the month of Shravana. I attach below two extracts from his book that deal with this topic.

After this he also describes another vrata calledसंकटहर गणपतिव्रत which falls on the 4th tithi of the dark half of Magha.

  

In actual practice in Maharashtra, संकष्टी चतुर्थी is observed on the 4th tithi of the dark half of each month. The phrase संकष्टी चतुर्थी may be explained as follows:संकट चतुर्थी in common parlance becomesसंकटी चतुर्थी, if संकट is looked upon as an adjective of चतुर्थी. The latter is feminine in gender, so संकट becomes संकटी. That word, for the common folk, becomes संकष्टी. In this connection, please see the following extract for Molesworth's Marathi-English Dictionary (1857).

The Danapati Aarati regularly recited in Maharashtra at the time of Ganeshapoojana, has the line संकटी पावावे निर्वाणी रक्षावे सुरवरवंदना.
The common folk often replace संकटी withसंकष्टी and sayसंकष्टीपावावे निर्वाणी रक्षावे सुरवरवंदना.
