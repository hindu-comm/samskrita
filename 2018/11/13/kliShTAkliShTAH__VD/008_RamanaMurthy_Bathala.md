Dear Sir,

Thanks for the reply.

In fact, as you explained in your previous post, I kept the second version 2 i.e., क्लिष्टा + अक्लिष्टाः = क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः in the notes prepared for myself.



I just posted the previous one to understand that there are wrong version of the aphorism available.



I have one hypothetical doubt. You need to pardon me for my weak Sanskrit Grammar.

In English:

books and books = various kinds of books

birds and birds = various kinds of birds

Similarly

pains and pains = various kinds of pains.

I want to mean “various kinds of pains” in Sanskrit,

क्लिष्टा + क्लिष्टाः = क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः (both क्लिष्टा)

But someone may break up क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः into क्लिष्टा + अक्लिष्टाः instead of क्लिष्टा + क्लिष्टाः Then he may get different meaning.

I have difficulty in the breakup of सवर्णदीर्घ सन्धि.

option 1: क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः = क्लिष्ट + अक्लिष्टाः (अ + अ = आ)

option 2: क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः = क्लिष्टा + अक्लिष्टाः (आ + अ = आ)

option 3: क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः = क्लिष्ट + आक्लिष्टाः (अ + आ = आ) \[ Ruled out as not meaningful\]

option 4: क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः = क्लिष्टा + आक्लिष्टाः (आ + आ = आ) \[ Ruled out as not meaningful\]

Which option I should take? Is it the context that dictates which option I should take?



Self study of Sanskrit without a teacher is almost impossible.

We are very fortunate to have Scholars like you to clear doubts.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
