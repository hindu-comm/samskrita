पञ्चतयः is wrong as it could not qualify वृत्तयः in feminine gender plural and पञ्चतयः is in masculine gender and singular. Now you can unerstand why it may be wrong blindly following English transliteration and English commentary. You could have seen the explanation given by me in Vacaspati mishra's Sanskrit commentary in Sanskrit.
