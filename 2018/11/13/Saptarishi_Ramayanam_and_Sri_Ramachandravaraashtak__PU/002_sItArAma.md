did anyone asked why it was reveled to him? Valmiki Ramayanam is already there in the world so why 7 more verses need to be attributed to Sapta Rishisi

Whats the need for bring all the big names Rishis like Kashyapa, Atri etc.

Who will validate the claim

What makes this a revelation and not product of Swami ji

What was the additional value these verse deliver that Valmiki Ramayanm missed

we should not ignore Pratyaksha, anumana and Pramana. Our rishi's never ignored these

  

Look at the state of where we are in now, a wonderful since of phonetic system taught in Panini Kshiksha

but some fancy by one person who wrote Nadikeshwara Kashika wrote a verse

"Nruttavasane nataraja rajah ..."

now Big chunk of so called scholars quote that as a reference and think all Sanskrit letters came from Damaru. after Shiva's dance, as if the person who wrote the verse saw Shiva dance and play his damaru.

  

This fancy has to stop, as a society we must not encourage it.  

There is a saying in Telugu "The speaker can say any number of stories, as long as there is a listener"
