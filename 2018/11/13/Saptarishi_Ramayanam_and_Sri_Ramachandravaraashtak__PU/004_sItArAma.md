if this is your proof then I rest my case, I did not understand why you have to share work of Swami Vidyatirtha of sringeri when we were talking about Swami Ganapati Sacchidananda.  

A statement, a quote, adage, Shloka cannot be a Pramana no matter how much it glorifies or in what book it was written.  

I don't need to temper down my thinking process. The creator of Yoga Shastra Patanjali and its vyasa Bhashya he did not mention that it was reveled it to him in a dream that too in many consecutive ones.  

You can stick to your belief system I don't have a problem with that, but if you share something on public forum then expect some responses otherwise share it in eco chambers where everybody thinks like you.
