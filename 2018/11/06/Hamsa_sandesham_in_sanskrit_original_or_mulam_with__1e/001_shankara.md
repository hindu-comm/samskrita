Namaste,

  

There are several Hamsa Sandesa kavyas, by Rupa Gosvami, Vedanta Desika, and others. Please clarify which one you are looking for.  

  

Moreover, Sanskrit kavays very rarely have padaccheda and anvaya for the whole text. Some sargas which are included in the school or college syllabus could be found with padaccheda and anvaya separately. In other cases, one can figure out padaccheda and anvaya based on the commentary.  

  

regards  
shankara
