The meanings are clear and these are well-known verses.

  

यदचेतनोऽपि पादै:....

The Sooryakaanta stone, when touched by the feet of the sun, glows, though it is insentient (inanimate). Then why should a proud man put up with an insult caused by another person?

(One of the meanings ofइन is सूर्य.)



साहित्यसंगीतकलाविहीन:...

A man, stranger to literature, music and arts, is verily an animal without a tail and horns. That is survives without eating grass is a great boon to animals.
