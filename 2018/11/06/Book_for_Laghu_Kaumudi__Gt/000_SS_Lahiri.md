Neeleshji, for my study of Laghu Kaumudi ( LK) i am using a book by Dr Satypal Singh and one by Medha Michika. Also i refer to your [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com) site whenever needed.  

  

Could you recommend a good book in Sanskrit and English for the study of LK.

  

Thanks & Regards

SS Lahiri
