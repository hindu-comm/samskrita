Madhusudan,

Vigrahais not an exact science.

It requires a good knowledge of both Sanskrit grammar and Sanskrit vocabulary before you can even begin to do avigraha.

  

However, there is awebsite that can do the work for you.

Itbreaks a compound word or even a complete sentence into individual words.

  

But, there can be a number of possible interpretations of even a short two-member compound word.

So it still requires a humanarmed with a handy Sanskrit dictionary tomake sense of the result(s).  

  

This is the web site:

  

<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/reader.en.html>  

  

Its interface is in English (or French).

Instructions on how to use it are given in a Help file, accessible from the menu at the bottom of the screen.

  

  

Good luck.
