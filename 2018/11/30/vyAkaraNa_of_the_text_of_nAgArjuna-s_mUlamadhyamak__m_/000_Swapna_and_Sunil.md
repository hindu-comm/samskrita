Namaste dear teachers,

  

I was looking for help / pointers to books or resources that can help me understand the word-by-word breakup and the vyākaraṇaof the text of Nāgārjuna's Mūlamadhyamakakārikā?

  

Something akin to the vyākaraṇaof the Bhagawad Gita text eminently completed by Winthrop Sargeant. I rely a lot for the understanding/study of the Gita from Sargeant's book and I really liked the format of Sargeant's book. ...and was looking to see if there was something similar for the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.

  

Any leads most appreciated.

  

Respectfully,

  

Sunil
