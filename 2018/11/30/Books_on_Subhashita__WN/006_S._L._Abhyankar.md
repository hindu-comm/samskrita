नमस्ते Dr. Y. N. राव-महोदय !

All the posts on 128\* सुभाषित-s are in my blog[संस्कृताध्ययनम्](http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/)linked here.

(\* - Study of 128thसुभाषितम् was posted on October 31, 2018.)

I must also mention that study of theसुभाषित-s"evolved", such that the pattern of study of [Lesson 1](https://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/learning-sanskrit-by-a-fresh-approach-lesson-1/) (linked here) is different from the pattern of study in [Lesson 128](https://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2018/10/31/lesson-128-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AD/) (linked here).

Now, since lesson No. 30 or so, the pattern of study has settled down into - (1)पदच्छेद-s (2) समासविग्रह-s (3) शब्दानां विश्लेषणानि(4) अन्वय-s and अन्वयार्थ-s,as also (5) वृत्तविश्लेषणम् and (6) Notes and comments.
