Namaste,

  

Nitasataka of Bhartrihari and Viduraniti with Padachcheda, anvaya and Hindi commentary are available online. Both are excellent collections of subhashitas. It is difficult to find such books in English, since such books are published mostly in regional languages and are meant for school students as part of their syllabus.
