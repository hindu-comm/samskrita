Here's wiki entry for Subhashita:

  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita>  
  
It says (among other things): "According to Mohana Bhāradvāja, Subhashita in Indian Literature is a single verse or single stanza, descriptive or didactic but complete in itself expressing a single idea, devotional, ethical or erotic in a witty or epigrammatic way."  
  
According to this definition, a subhashita is allowed to contain erotic themes/ideas.

  

Maybe I'm a bit prurient, but I must admit that I do enjoy "cheap poetry" of this sort! The cheaper the better! :-)
