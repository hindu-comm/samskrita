नमस्ते Dr. Y. N. राव-महोदय !

I am sorry, that you have been having problem with locating the lessons. I guess, the problem was due to the poor visibility of the "main menu". I just now changed the "theme" of the blog. By that the main menu is now better visible. The first item in the menu is "Learning Sanskrit by fresh approach". All the lessons are under this menu-item. On moving the cursor to this menu item, one gets sub-menu items such as अनुक्रमणिका १-४० etc.

I hope this will help.

Kindly acknowledge and please advise whether it is better now.
