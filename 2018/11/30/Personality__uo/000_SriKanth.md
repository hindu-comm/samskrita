Hi,  

  

In English we say the word "Personality" to mean the complex of characteristics that distinguishes an individual. Some usage like "She has a very pleasant personality" etc.  

  

Are there any word in usage meaning this word in Sanskrit.. Please help with some examples in literature.  

  

Thanks

SriKanth!
