Sri Sunder ji,

  

Thank you - this is what I was thinking too. If it is OK with you, could you direct me to any collection of time-related subhashitani (with english translation, preferably) that you might have come across on [archive.org](http://archive.org) or any other web or print source?

  

thanks

Harsha
