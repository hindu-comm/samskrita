Sri Shankara ji,

  

I just remembered, here (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/4WRVV4Zk9zM/aFG0Y6OmAQAJ;context-place=tags/bvparishat/discussion>) we had interacted earlier on the topic of Samskrita subhashitani + English translation, and you gave an excellent reference lead.

  

Sharing it here for the benefit of the forum:<https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.org%2Fdetails%2FMahaasubhaasitasamgrahaVol1-8&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGF12PYjnnHiJymcNLoMjK58SKmiQ>

  

kind regards

Harsha
