Namaskar Madam,

  

I believe a healthy dose of western/american thinking on such topics as (personal) networking, time management, team development, (physical/personal) energy management, peak performance, deliberate practice, public speaking etc will do some good to some of us here.

  

And I say this because America/the West has one redeeming quality in my opinion - a bias for action, empiricism and research. That is a good thing.

  

kind rgds,

Harsha
