Harsha,

  

It would be better to use subhashitas or other quotations instead of coming up with simple translations. Besides adding very little value to the message, such translations looks rather silly.  

The supposed Kalidasa poem looks suspect to me. Had it been a genuine Kalidasa poem, someone online would have quoted the original shloka by now. The reverse translations are hardly Kalidasaesque at any rate.  

  

If you were looking for Samskrit references to early morning, you could point to "सूषा च मे सुदिनं च मे" in the चमकप्रश्न or shlokas like कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः ... which are lived experiences to this day.
