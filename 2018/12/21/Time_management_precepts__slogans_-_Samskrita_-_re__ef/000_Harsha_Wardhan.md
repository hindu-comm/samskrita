Namaskar to all,



I am assisting on a time management/self-improvement project. I am looking to introduce modern precepts of time management and self-improvement in Samskrita language because I feel this will help us retain the precepts better.



Since I don't know Samskrita properly (or honestly, not at all), I request the learned members here to consider helping us out, if you'd be so kind, on the following:





****1. There is a fine poem by Kalidasa named Ushavandanam (Salutation to the Dawn). it goes like this:****



  
Look to this Day!

For it is Life, the very Life of Life.

In its brief course lie all the Verities and Realities of your Existence;

The Bliss of Growth,

The Glory of Action,

The Splendor of Beauty;

For Yesterday is but a Dream,

And Tomorrow is only a Vision;

But Today well lived makes

every Yesterday a Dream of Happiness,

and every Tomorrow a Vision of Hope.

Look well therefore to this Day!

Such is the Salutation of the Dawn.





Here (<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_deities_misc/salutedawn.html?lang=sa>) I found various ****reverse**** translations into Samskrita but**I am looking for the proper original samskrita poem by Kalidasa.** There is some confusion. Any guidance would be much appreciated.







****2. Translation of a few time management precepts/slogans from English into Samskrita:****



  

****Word-based:****

****  
****

  

a)Could you tell us what**is the best Samskrita word for "Now" in the sense of "this instant" or "this moment"? Kindly****also consider directly translating****"this instant" or "this moment" as an alternative.**

**b) Could you guide us whether"Adya" the best translation of the word "Today"?**

  

  

****Phrase-based (for translation from English into Samskrita):****

****  
****



**a) "WHAT ARE YOU (/ AM I) DOING RIGHT NOW?"**



Also, is there a way to incorporate the emphasis of "right now"?

  

  

**b) "TAKE DIRECT ACTION; GO ALL OUT"**





**c) "HABIT = LIFE; EXERTION = DESTINY"**



Here, '= ' could be taken to mean 'is' while translating into Samskrita.





**d) "WHAT IS THE BEST USE OF MY (/ YOUR) TIME RIGHT NOW?"**  

**  
**

**e) Variation of (d): " IS THIS THE BEST POSSIBLE USE OF MY (/ YOUR) TIME RIGHT NOW?"**



This is the famous Lakein's question.







***3. *Swami Vivekananda's (very) free translation of the first part of the following Kathopanisadic verse****

  

उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत।

क्षुरस्य धारा निशिता दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति ॥





goes like this:****"Arise, awake, and rest (/stop) not till the goal is reached."****, whereas the actual translation goes like this:



**"Arise, awake, find out the great ones and learn of them; for sharp as a razor's edge, hard to traverse, difficult of going is that path, say the sages."**





****Swami Vivekananda's translation sounds much better (to me). Is there a way to exactly translate that into Samskrita?****

****  
****

That is, exact translation of this sentence:****"Arise, awake, and rest (/stop) not till the goal is reached."****







I apologize for any shortcomings in posting this request. I sincerely hope you'll respond to this request and oblige.





with thanks

Harsha
