Harsha,

  

 There must bea language problem here.

  

As I understandyourpost. Your intention is to reinterpret texts from a bygone era as if they were in fact written in modern times.

The effectwould be to present the ancestors (Indian variety) as being a couple of thousand years more technically ahead of Westerners.

  

That is not what thisWesterner understands by the term 'timemanagement'.

That would bescanning ancient manuscripts for hints and tips on efficient use of time and effort is praiseworthy.

Such scanning has been accomplished. It goes by the name of Yoga Sutra.

  

By all means, sing the praises of thedawn in whatever language that pleases you. But instant coffee machines and the like will just sit there looking at you.

  

Is thatan Indian 'today' or a real one, or is something getting lost in thetranslation?

  

guru Taff.
