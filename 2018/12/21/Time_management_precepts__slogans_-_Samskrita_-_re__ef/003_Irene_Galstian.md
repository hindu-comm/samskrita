I agree, Harsha, as long as it's a healthy dose.  
Best wishes,  
Irene

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\>\> \*1. There is a fine poem by Kalidasa named Ushavandanam (Salutation to the  
\>\>  
\>\> Dawn). it goes like this:\*  

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> Look to this Day!  
\>\>  
\>\> For it is Life, the very Life of Life.  
\>\>  
\>\> In its brief course lie all the Verities and Realities of your Existence;  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> The Bliss of Growth,  
\>\>  
\>\> The Glory of Action,  
\>\>  
\>\> The Splendor of Beauty;  
\>\>  
\>\> For Yesterday is but a Dream,  
\>\>  
\>\> And Tomorrow is only a Vision;  
\>\>  
\>\> But Today well lived makes  
\>\>  
\>\> every Yesterday a Dream of Happiness,  
\>\>  
\>\> and every Tomorrow a Vision of Hope.  
\>\>  
\>\> Look well therefore to this Day!  
\>\>  
\>\> Such is the Salutation of the Dawn.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> Here (  
\>\> <https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_deities_misc/salutedawn.html?lang=sa>) I  
\>\>  

\>\> found various \*reverse \*translations into Samskrita but \*I am looking for  
\>\>  
\>\> the proper original samskrita poem by Kalidasa. \*There is some confusion.  

\>\>  
\>\> Any guidance would be much appreciated.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\>\> \*2. Translation of a few time management precepts/slogans from English  
\>\> into Samskrita:\*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*Word-based: \*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> a) Could you tell us what\* is the best Samskrita word for "Now" in the  
\>\> sense of "this instant" or "this moment"? Kindly \*\*also consider directly  
\>\>  
\>\> translating \*\*"this instant" or "this moment" as an alternative.\*  
\>\>  
\>\> \*b) Could you guide us whether "Adya" the best translation of the word  
\>\> "Today"?\*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*Phrase-based (for translation from English into Samskrita):\*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*a) "WHAT ARE YOU (/ AM I) DOING RIGHT NOW?"\*  

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> Also, is there a way to incorporate the emphasis of "right now"?  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\>\> \*b) "TAKE DIRECT ACTION; GO ALL OUT"\*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*c) "HABIT = LIFE; EXERTION = DESTINY"\*  

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> Here, '= ' could be taken to mean 'is' while translating into Samskrita.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\>\> \*d) "WHAT IS THE BEST USE OF MY (/ YOUR) TIME RIGHT NOW?"\*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*e) Variation of (d): " IS THIS THE BEST POSSIBLE USE OF MY (/ YOUR) TIME  
\>\>  
\>\> RIGHT NOW?"\*  

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> This is the famous Lakein's question.  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\>\> \*3. Swami Vivekananda's (very) free translation of the first part of the  
\>\> following Kathopanisadic verse \*  

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत।  
\>\>  
\>\> क्षुरस्य धारा निशिता दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति ॥  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\>\> goes like this: \*"Arise, awake, and rest (/stop) not till the goal is  
\>\> reached."\*, whereas the actual translation goes like this:  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*"Arise, awake, find out the great ones and learn of them; for sharp as a  

\>\>  
\>\> razor's edge, hard to traverse, difficult of going is that path, say the  

\>\> sages."\*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> \*Swami Vivekananda's translation sounds much better (to me). Is there a  
\>\> way to exactly translate that into Samskrita? \*  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> That is, exact translation of this sentence: \*"Arise, awake, and rest  
\>\> (/stop) not till the goal is reached."\*  

\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\>  
\>\> I apologize for any shortcomings in posting this request. I sincerely hope  
\>\>
