Namaskar Kesarahrdayam ji,

  

1\) I found the poem first attributed to Kalidasa in a self-improvement book by Dale Carnegie called 'How to Stop Worrying and Start Living' first published 1948 in the US.

  

2\) Your translations are very nice and apt. This is exactly what I was hoping for. If it is not too much trouble, I would request you to kindly have a look at the remaining slogans (of course, at your convenience) pls.

  

thanks

Harsha
