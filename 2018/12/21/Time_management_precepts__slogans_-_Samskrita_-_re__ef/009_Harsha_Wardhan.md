Sri Shankara ji, as always, you have helped excellently. Thank you so much.

  

If it is not too much trouble, is it possible for you to guide us about any samskrita ***subhashitani collections about Time and its proper usage***, preferably with English translations, if possible? I remember seeing a multivolume set of subhashitani at [archive.org](http://archive.org), but I am not sure if that is the one, or if there are some better ones also available.

  

I have always appreciated your excellent references and guidance, Shankara ji.

  

Thank you,

Harsha
