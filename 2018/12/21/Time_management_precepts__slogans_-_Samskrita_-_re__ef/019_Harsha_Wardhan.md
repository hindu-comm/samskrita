Sri Naresh,

  

Subhashitani are great, and I am parallelly scouring them.  

  

As regards my sentences, I agree they look lame. They lack elegance. That is why I'm seeking your help.  

  

The entire burden of my effort is to bring in a very important mnemonic/precept of time management - Lakein's question - in a new form and language.

  

The question and its variations go like this:

  

-   **What is the best use of my time right now? / What is the best use
    of your time right now?  
    ** -   **Is this the best use of my time right now? / Is this the best use
    of your time right now?  
    ** -   **What am I doing right now? / What are you doing right now?  
    **

  

I'd appreciate any help you could provide in translating them into refined Samskrita.

  

  

kind regards

Harsha
