Harsha,

  

"I hope there's no confusion here"

  

I'm afraidthere is. As you must gather from the different replies you get.

  

It centres on your use of the phrase 'time management'.

  

# [Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management)

  Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, *especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency or productivity.*[More at“Wikipedia”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management)

  

Taking time off, to stare at the scenery out of the office window or whatever is to *relax* conscious control, the exact opposite.

  

Again, are you wanting to re-expressKalidasa in a moretimely manner?

  

You must know that words such as 'now'- in English as wellas Sanskrit- can servemore than one sense, like vocative *and* temporal.

  

*Toexcludethe vocative sense and so leave only the temporal 'instant of time', is to degrade the poets work.*

  

English schoolboys are taught English literature along with their English grammar.

Not too many of the worlds' citizens are capable of re-writing Shakespeare.

  

If I'm off the mark, deduct 10 points from my score, but note the non-poetic uses of my 'mark'.

  

Taff Rivers,

 This erstwhile schoolboy passed both of his English exams in times past.
