(1.) I have no idea. Maybe this poem wasn't even composed by Kalidasa, and was merely an email/message forward back in the day? But no clue really.  
  
(2.)  
  
For Now/in this moment/present time :-  
  
इदानीम् (in this present time);  
अधुना (now) ; अधुनैव = अधुना + एव (adhunaiva; now with emphasis) ; अधुनैव कुरु ! = Do it now!  
In this instant = अस्मिन् क्षणे;  
This instant = क्षणमेतत् = क्षणम् + एतत् ।  
  
Yes, अद्य is a good translation for today.  
  
**"WHAT ARE YOU (/ AM I) DOING RIGHT NOW?" = इदानीं भवान् किं करोति?  
  
  
**Will try to post about the rest later.
