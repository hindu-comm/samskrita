Hi Taff,

  

I hope there's no confusion here. I am just looking for guidance and help in translating some sentences/slogans pertaining to time management and self-improvement (that are in vogue today), into Samskrita.

  

Additionally, I wanted some guidance in finding out the original version of a samskrita poem about daily time management attributed to Kalidasa, and the samskrita translation of a self-improvement quote (originally in English) by Swami Vivekananda.

  

That's all. Nothing more.

  

kind regards

Harsha
