Namaste,

  

I am reviving an old thread, since I hope several members of BVP would be interested in this topic.

  

Bharatasya Samvidhanam, Sanskrit translation of the constitution of India by Lakshman Sastri Joshi is available online at the link given below. A typo in the books title and absence of proper tags kept this book hidden from our eyes so long.
