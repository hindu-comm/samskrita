Dear list,

  

I assume some of the members of the list are already users of Aksharamukha to transliterate between scripts.

  

I have done a major update to the tool. The UI has been completely reformatted to look very modern (and mobile-friendly) and the backend has been rewritten in Python.

  

Aksharamukha now supports 66 scripts that fall within the greater Indic cultural sphere.

(You can see a comparison here:<http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/#/script-matrix/>)

  

I've often seen Devanagari referred to as the 'Sanskrit' script (in this list and outside of the list). The truth it is not. It is a very modern phenomenon. As a language that spanned multiple oceans and lands, Sanskrit has always been written in the local script (and it is still written so). For instance, Grantha in Tamil Nadu, Sinhala in Sri Lanka, Javanese/Balinese in Indonesia, Phags Pa in Mongolia and Siddham in China/Korea/Japan. I hope that the tool would bring back the diversity of expressing the language in various visual flavors.

  

You can read sample Texts (in Sanskrit/Pali) in all of the 66 scripts.

The new converter can be now reached at<http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/>

  

It has additionally individual script pages (showing the vowel/consonant repertoire), view syllabaries, conjuncts and even play some games to learn different scripts.

  

Any feedback or comments for improvement would be greatly appreciated!

  

Cheers,

  

Vinodh Rajan
