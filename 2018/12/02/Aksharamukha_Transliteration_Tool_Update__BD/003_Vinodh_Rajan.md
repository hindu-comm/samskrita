I approximate to the closest phonetic equivalents.

Burmese and Thai retain the tradition of writing Sanskrit/Pali, so they do have a one to one equivalent with the core Indic set. So, any Burmese & Thai Sanskrit/Pali texts should convert to Devanagari seamlessly.

  

But Burmese and Thai also have several innovations/characters to support their own phonology. For instance, Thai has 18 vowels and 5 tones. And I for the most part don't support native language texts in these kinds of extended-East Asian scripts.

  

Burmese didn't innovate that much, except for a circle below character. So, Burmese language texts in Burmese scripts should convert pretty decently to Devangari. But you will come across weird character combinations (that are, of course, legal in Burmese). And it won't be readable, unless, you know the reading rules of Burmese orthography (Indic rules won't work here).
