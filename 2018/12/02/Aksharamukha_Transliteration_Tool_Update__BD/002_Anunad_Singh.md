Dear Vinodh ji,  

Thank you for this great project which can change almost all Indian, and almost all scripts related to Indic scripts tightly or loosely. A natural question arises as to how you are managing those characters which are available in one script but not in another. In particular, could you comment on conversion of Burmese and Thai scripts into Devanagari?  
  

I would suggest to provide an option to the user to 'blindly' convert the script into a script of his choice. This would be useful in case the user is not able to recognise the script, or the text is in mixed script.  
  

-- anunAda
