Namaste -  
  
Is there anything available online that gives sandhi and samaasa vigraha and meaning for all words/shloka of amarakosha? If so, can you please direct me to it?  
  
Also, I am going to get a hard book also for this. Any recommendations for the book with the same criterion i.e sandhi and samaasa and meaning?  
  
Thanks  
Shashikiran
