Thanks for sharing your experience on that.

  

During the first level you get the material in pdf? Is it enough o keep you busy?

  

Also is there a way to go faster with the course other than the one lesson per week. I already have a basic knowledge of Sanskrit hence I could possibly move faster and proceed to level 2.

  

Would it be possible to share a little more on the class material provided?
