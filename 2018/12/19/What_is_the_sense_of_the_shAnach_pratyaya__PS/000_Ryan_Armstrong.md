नमस्ते Dear Group

  

Brief request:

Could someone please provide a brief description of theशानच् प्रत्यय?

  

More detailed - I am looking at the wordदृश्यमान from the first line of theदक्षिणामूर्ति स्रोत्रम.

At first, I thought that this is a samaasa of दृश्यandमान but after further consideration it seems to be theशानच् प्रत्यय with dhaatuपश् .

Is this assumptioncorrect?

I have googled but cannot find an answer, so any help would be appreciated.

  

Thanks in advance.

Ryan
