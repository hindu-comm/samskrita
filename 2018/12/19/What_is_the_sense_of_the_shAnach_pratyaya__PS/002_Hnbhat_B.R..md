It is शानच् from the root दृश् by the rule वर्तमाने = in the present tense, लटः शतृशानचौ the लट् is substituted by शतृ and शानच्। Partcularly, the परस्मैपद is substituted byशतृ and आत्मनेपद by शानच्
l Here it is in the passive voiceकर्मणि asदृश्यते (इति \>)°दृश्यमान° as adjective to °नगरी° meaning \[the world\]\[equal to\] "\[the city\] being seen" \[in the mirror\].

  

I hope you will link the words in their sequence to their meaning विश्वं दर्पण-दृश्यमान-नगरी-तुल्यं In the bext phrase the same verb is substituted by शतृ as it is in the active voice कर्तरि as पश्यति (इति) पश्यन् one who sees etc.

  

If you take as पश्य् and दृश्य् as two seperate root, they are two different roots. But in Sanskrit one पश्य  is substituted for the other दृश् as per Sanskrit grammatical rule.
