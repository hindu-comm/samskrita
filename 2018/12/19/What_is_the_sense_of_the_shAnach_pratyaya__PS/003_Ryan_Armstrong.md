धन्यवाद आचर्य  

and also to Taff-ji

  

I apologise for not replying sooner - I was up in the mountains and without my resources when I asked, and as fate would have it the data connection failed about two hours later.

2 days without electronic influence in a natural setting is most conducive to proper dhyaanam and mananam (in this case on this stotram.)

The first verse alone seems to contain everything ever needed to be known about anything.

Your explanations are most edifying.

Kind Regards

Ryan
