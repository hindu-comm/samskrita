‡•ê  

I have not started with understanding the whole Sanskrit language.  
Since it is a time consuming exercise.  
I can use the time saved towards other good tasks.

  
I am trying to decipher Shrimad Bhagavad Gita and all the Vedas.  
In order to be clear about what is dharma and what is adharma.  
  

Since I started facing problems in the translations,  
I started to check the precise meanings myself.  
  
And while doing so, I started to analyse

starting from the particular word in context which looked problematic  
and started learning the rules used only in context of the particular word.

  

The problem that I presume may happen is, a particular word may have another context

as well, and until I don't read the whole Sanskrit grammar, that particular context,

I may miss out.  
  
But then since tools such as these <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/reader.fr.html>  
are available these days, this problem can be overcome presuming the particular

tool has addressed all possible permutations.  
  
So then, do I still need to learn the whole Sanskrit?
