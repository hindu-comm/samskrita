Ganesh,

  

 "In order to be clear about what is dharma and what is adharma"  

  

That is yet a different reason to give for youroriginalposts!

  

If you are not clear in your own mind as to what you seek, then you expect nothing but confusion from us members as to what you seek.

  

What constitutes the right behaviour and what the wrong behaviour depends entirelyonone's personal situation.

On the one hand, the BG provides practical advice that it is OK to kill one's friends or relations under one extreme circumstance.

And it offers the practice of Yoga as a general antidoteto life'swoes.

  

The yoga sutra itself gets down to specifics.

There, it provides a precise definition of dharma, whichdiffers from that of the BG, in that itisdevoid of any moral overtone.

The BG appeals to the spiritual side of humanity, the YS to the practical side.

  

Doubt and uncertainty in all degrees of intensity are facts of everyday life.

When things do become too much it's time to give the Doctor a call or the priest as appropriate.

  

This speaks Guru Taff Rivers
