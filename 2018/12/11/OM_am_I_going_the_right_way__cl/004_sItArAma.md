If this is how you feel, do not even touch Bhagwadgeeta with a 10 ft pole. Read basic subhashitas and panchatantra or even better go to [archive.org](http://archive.org) and read scanned copies of chandamama and evaluate your understanding.  

  

Bhagwadgeeta is very high philosophical text almost the gist of all upanishad's put together. You are most likely jump in wrong conclusions. I have met people who can barely say Rama Shabda yet they think they can explain Gayatri Mantra.  

If you want to know what it feels like jumping into Gita studies without proper understanding read Patnayak's my Gita. If his works makes logical sense then you gone to point of no return.
