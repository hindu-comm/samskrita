Hello Ganesh,

  

Having read multiple of your emails on this group, I would like to answer the subject of this current email ("Am I going the right way") in one clear word - NO.

  

Your efforts of reading the sanskrit text without understanding the sanskrit language will only lead you into troubles.

  

If you are interested in Bhagavad Geeta and other such texts, you should either -

a\) Don't mind reading the translations and take them in faith (without questioning the correctness of translations), or

b\) Study the language systematically and then approach these texts. Many of the courses on sanskrit language will actually teach one of these texts at the middle or higher level.

  

Your initial investment of six to twelve months in properly understanding the language will leave years ahead for "other good tasks" as you mention above.
