"the BG provides practical advice that it is OK to kill one's friends or relations under one extreme circumstance."

  

No, Gita doesn't give any such advice.  

  

It's a kshatriya's appointed duty to protect dharma, and Arjuna is born a kshatriya. Adharma was committed by his antagonists, and they were given ample opportunities to redeem themselves. But they chose to go to war instead. Krishna merely reminds a despondent (at the thought of having to fight and kill his cousins) Arjuna that he must perform his appointed duty as a defender of dharma.  

  

It's incidental that Arjuna's antagonists happened to be his kith and kin -- cousins, teachers, relatives, etc.

  

The message is not to kill; it's to perform one's duty:

  

"सहजं कर्म कौन्तेय सदोषमपि न त्यजेत् ।  

सर्वारम्भा हि दोषेण धूमेनाग्निरिवावृताः ॥"
