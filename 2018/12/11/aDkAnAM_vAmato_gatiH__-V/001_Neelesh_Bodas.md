Thanks for the question. In this context, I also want to know what is exact meaning of the word "वामतः". In particular, what is the the prakriti,what is the pratyay, what is the sutra giving this pratyay, and what is the meaning of the word. My intuitive answer would be "वामतः = from left" (just like दक्षिणतः or गृहतः) but that doesn't sound right, numbers actually grow ("गतिः") from right to left.
