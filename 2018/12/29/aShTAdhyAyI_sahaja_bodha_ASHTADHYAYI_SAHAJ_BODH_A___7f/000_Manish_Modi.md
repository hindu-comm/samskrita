Ashtadhyayi is a sutra-style treatise on Sanskrit grammar, estimated to have been completed between 6th and 4th centuries BCE by Acarya Panini. The 3,959 aphorisms on linguistics, syntax and semantics presented in "eight chapters" are the foundation of Sanskrit grammar. This comprehensive and scientific theory of grammar is seen as the starting point of Classical Sanskrit. Panini's analysis of noun compounds still forms the basis of modern linguistic theories of compounding in Indian languages.

  

This seminal work played an important role in making Sanskrit the preeminent language of learning and literature in ancient and medieval India. It has attracted and continues to attract many excellent commentaries, among them Patanjali’s Mahabhashya and Bhattoji Dikshit’s Vaiyakarana Siddhanta Kaumudi. 

  

Traditional methods and textbooks based on the traditional methods require the student to devote 12 years in order to master Sanskrit grammar. Using the method described in this book, the diligent student can master Sanskrit in just 6 months.

  

Dr Pushpa Dikshit, who heads the Paniniya Shodha Samsthanam. is one of India’s leading lights in the field of Sanskrit grammar. She has devised a unique method of teaching Sanskrit, known as the PANINIYA PAUSHPI PRAKRIYA which has been fully described in this set of books. We earnestly recommend this work to all students, scholars and lovers of Sanskrit.

  

This set of five books is nicely printed. We are proud to make this masterpiece available at our bookstore and through mail order. We ship books all over the world and accept payment by IMPS, NEFT, Paytm, Visa and MasterCard.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
