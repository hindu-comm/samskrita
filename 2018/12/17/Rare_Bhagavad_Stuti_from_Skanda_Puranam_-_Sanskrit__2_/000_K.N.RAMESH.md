Dear All,  

  

Greetings and Namaste. It has been a while since my last posting and it has been difficult to find personal time for stotra sharing in the last year or so. Hopefully, I will be able to devote the due attention to this in 2019 with the blessings of Sri Bhagavan.

  

As Vaikunta Ekadashi falls on Tuesday (18-Dec-2018), I am delighted to share a beautiful and rare hymn on Lord Vishnu by Dhruva taken from Skanda Purana, Kashi Khanda, and Chapter 21. Please find the elaborate Phalashruti in the attached documents. Lord Narayana declares that, though there are innumerable hymns on Him, this one makes him pleased above all of them. It is capable of destroying all sins and misfortunes and bestowing the choices wealth in all forms.

  

May We Seek The Blessing of Lord Narayana on Vaikuntha Ekadashi with this beautiful and highly potent stuti.
