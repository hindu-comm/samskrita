The books are published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, established under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, See \<<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/contact.php>\>

On this "contact" page there is email ID \<rsksrp\[at\]yahoo\[dot\]com\> for the "Research and Publications Section" also.

In Mumbai a Swadhyaya Kendra is run in चाणक्य building in Somayya Complex in Vidyavihar (East). I got my sets of प्रथमा दीक्षा and द्वितीया दीक्षा from this Kendra. There must be similar Kendras in many other cities.

If I remember it right, the set of 5 books of प्रथमा दीक्षा (Total 900+ pages) costed just Rs. 120 or so in 2012.

Looks like the Govt. is doing this as Human Resource Development activity. That can be the only logic of the cost being so economical, too much below the cost.
