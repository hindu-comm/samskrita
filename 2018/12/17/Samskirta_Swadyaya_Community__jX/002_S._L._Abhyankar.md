Dear Mr. Vivek and Mr. "J Ra",

  

I appreciate that a Google-group is created for Samskrita-swadhyaya.

  

From what I know, most of Sanskrit grammar is covered in प्रथमा दीक्षा and द्वितीया दीक्षा.

  

One does not need to have scanned books. The books are very economically priced. There are five books for प्रथमा दीक्षा (Total 900+ pages) and three books for द्वितीया दीक्षा (Total 1190-odd pages). Scanning will be helpful to have the illustrations in the book for प्रथमा दीक्षा, which supplement understanding new words and phrases.

  

Syllabus for तृतीया दीक्षा, goes into study of specified texts such as बालकाण्डम् of वाल्मीकिरामायणम् and विदुरनीतिः from महाभारतम्.

  

It would help if the interactions focus on प्रथमा दीक्षा and द्वितीया दीक्षा. Maybe, it would be further helpful, if there would be two separate groups for प्रथमा दीक्षा and द्वितीया दीक्षा, so that there would be no confusion in Qs and As.
