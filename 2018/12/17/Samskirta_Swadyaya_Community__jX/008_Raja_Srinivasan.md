Narasimhan-Swamin

My apologies. I found an address in Mumbai for the purchase of Sanskrit books. As you say, it is very inexpensive. I will place an order as soon as I verify the contact information.



The address and phone number I have is:

These books are in print and available. Please buy the print editions and support the publication. I can understand the recourse we need to take for books which are not in print / available. May be, some day, these books can be bought as paid ebooks for convenience.
