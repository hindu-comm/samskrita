sunder,

  

Simply having those SVBF fonts installed is not enough to solve the problem.

.

Those unreadable files, SVBF_Sanskrit_18.pdf and the like, *have been compressed* with**FlateDecode.**

**  
**

Probably simply to shorten download times in the old days of very slow networks.

  

So these days, they have to be decompressed first. (But compressing may also have been done to protect copyrighted material!)

  

Inside, the top of the raw file file reads:

  

 %PDF-1.5

 %Ã¤Ã¼Ã¶ÃŸ

 2 0 obj

 \<\</Length 3 0 R/Filter/**FlateDecode**\>\>

  

As to how to decompress a*FlateDecoded* pdf file - that is another matter.

  

Please, members that post copies of URL's should take care to verify their validity, so that they actually are helpful.
