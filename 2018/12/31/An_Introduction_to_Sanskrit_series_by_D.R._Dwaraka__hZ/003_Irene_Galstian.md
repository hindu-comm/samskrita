OK, yes, that's the one I was thinking of. If you try opening the  
lessons Ramana asked for, you'll get an error about an identity-h font  
and Devanagari doesn't display. This question went back and forth a  
while ago, but I don't remember if anyone was able to resolve it.  
These files have been put on many sites, but they are all copies of  
those problematic PDFs. If nobody has correctly opening PDFs, it might  
be worth putting up the query on the coders' forum.
