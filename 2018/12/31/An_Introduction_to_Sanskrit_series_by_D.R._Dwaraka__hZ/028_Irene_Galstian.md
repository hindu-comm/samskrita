I understand the part about the encoding and the Python code. My  
question is, what problem are we trying to solve?  
We don't have access to Sanskrit Vijay, and I was unable so far to  
trace the coder, since the fonts are quite old. Right now all we have  
is Hindi Vijay.  
Let's say we've decompressed the PDF - then what? In other words,  
what's the reason the file isn't displaying correctly? Is it  
corruption or something else? If a corruption, then how are we doing  
to fix it without having the correct font? If it's something else,  
what's the diagnosis?  
By the way, I've tried replacing Sanskrit Vijay with Hindi Vijay using  
Infix, and the text was still garbled.
