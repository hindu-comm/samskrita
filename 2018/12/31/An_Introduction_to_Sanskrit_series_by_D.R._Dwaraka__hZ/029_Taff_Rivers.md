sunder,

  

 The word is not*mystery*, but *mist - things get lost in time.*  

The series of 20 were spread over a few years worth of volumes of
journal.

Which were then collected together into a web site.

Which morphed, badly, into a Blog forum.

  

To me what really matters is the big morph - from that of a learner of Sanskrit who proffered up a series of essays he wrote off his own bat, for marking my the real teachers. Rather in the manner of our very own Mr Kamesh.

  

In M.R. Dwarakanath's very first article - the intro- we have:

  

*the author acknowledges he **is no***

***sanskritist** but **merely a lay enthusiast**, playing the role of a*

*facilitator. He requests your indulgence for the many gaffs and*

*errors to be found in these lessons and welcomes your drawing his*

*attention to them.*

  

In short, they are not the work of a professional Sanskritist, and should not be used as a tutorial of any sort. Pdf-ed or not pdf-fed.

  

Thanks for the intellectual challenge.

  

Taff the analyst.
