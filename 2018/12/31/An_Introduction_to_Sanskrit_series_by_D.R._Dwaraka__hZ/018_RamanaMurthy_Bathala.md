Dear Sir,

  

This is not the correct one. This is one is conversation sanskrit.

In the Unit-II, the following is mentioned

"In Unit-1, page-26: व्याघ्रः-tiger(घोष)-to proclaim. क्षिप्रं should read क्षिप्र, and मन्दं should read मन्द Page 27: नासिका जिघ्रति-nose smells."

Please see the sceenshot.

That means the UNIT-I should be about 27 pages.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
