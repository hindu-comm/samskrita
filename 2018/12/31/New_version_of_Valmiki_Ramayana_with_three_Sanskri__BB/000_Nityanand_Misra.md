Dear list members

  

Is there a newly typeset/composed edition (and not a facsimile reprint) of the Valmiki Ramayana with the three Sanskrit commentaries Bhusana, Tilaka, and Shiromani? I have the PDFs of all the seven *kanda*s but I want to buy hard copies of the book for my library. The version published by Parimal Publications is a facsimile reprint of the old edition (I think by Gujarati Printing Press). I had thought the edition published by the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan would be a new print, but going by the preview on Exotic India website (link below), it also appears to be a facsimile reprint.

While a facsimile reprint is still better than a book being out of print, I wonder if there is a newer version.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
