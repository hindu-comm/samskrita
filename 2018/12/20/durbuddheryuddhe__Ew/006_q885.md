Please forgive my inexperience. I remembered the form buddhyāḥ but notbuddhēḥ. I must admit I have not memorized the declensions and conjugations as well as I should have. I rely on [sanskrit.inria.fr](http://sanskrit.inria.fr) far too much. When I plugged "durbuddhe.h" into there, it didn't recognize it. Apparently it didn't readduḥ as a part of a compound for some reason. I will refrain posting such questions here in the future. I will instead ask such questions on beginners' forums.

  

As for external sandhi, I took a class in Pāṇini but it dissolved before we got past sandhi. So I know it quite well, but that is the limit of my expertise. I'm pretty okay with parsing Pāṇini given a decent translation but I haven't learned all the important sūtras.

  

I am currently reading Bhagavad-Gītā with the help ofWinthrop Sargeant. It doesn't give the prātipadikas, only the inflected forms.
I was assuming buddhēḥ came from buddha rather than buddhi, which in retrospect doesn't make sense.

  

Again, please excuse my ignorance.

  

Thank you.  
  
No, I do not also post as J.Ra.
