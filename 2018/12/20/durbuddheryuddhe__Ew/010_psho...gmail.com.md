Please also take a look at:

  

<https://arshaavinash.in/index.php/download/gramatical-analysis-of-bhagavad-gita/>

  

It has more details than Sargeant's but it covers only chapters 1-6.

  

Yuganta (by Iravati Karve) says that chapters 7-18 seem to be later additions to the original text. So perhaps it's OK to have stopped at chapter 6. :-)
