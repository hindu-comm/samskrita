q885,  
  

**dur-buddhi**

   • *f.* weak-mindedness, silliness, *MBh*.

   • *mfn*. silly, foolish, ignorant, *malignant, MBh*. R. &c. \[486,1\]

  

If you know enough external sandhi to parse **buddhēr** as **buddhēḥ** then surely you must know the declension of substantives of vowel stems in -**i**-. It's very beginners basic Sanskrit grammar.

  

BTW. Do you also post as J.Ra?
