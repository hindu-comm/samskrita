Hello Sunil:

 I regret that this book was never part of my library, and therefore find myself unable to be of help. It would be helpful to inquire at a Ramakrishna Mutt. If you plan to be in India in thenear future, there is certainly one office of the Mutt in Chennai, and there may be others in Bengaluru. I believe Thrissur, near Kochi/Ernakulam, is also home to one.

 After the New Year, I will ask Rosie Ramos to look at the boxes of books in my garage to see if we can locate any Sanskrit or Malayalam books. I suspect the contents are most likely to be in Medicine and Pharmacology, but we could run across the stray ones in Sanskrit.
