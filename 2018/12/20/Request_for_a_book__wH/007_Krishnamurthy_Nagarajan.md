Rameshji,

  

I think the book referred to by you in your mail dated 20 Dec 2018 as "Jeevitavrittaanda of Ramakrishna paramahamsa by Hriday Datta" should read as " Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsadeber Jivan Vrittanta" (a Bengali Book) by Ramachandra Datta. An English rendering of this book entitled "The Life Story of Sri Ramakrishna" has been rendered by Swami Sarvadevananda \[<https://www.vedanta.com/store/The-Life-Story-of-Sri-Ramakrishna-The-First-Biography-of-Sri-Ramakrishna_moreinfo.html>\]  

  

I am not able to trace any soft copies in Internet but found that the hard copy of the book can be procured online from the following two sources.

  

1. Advaita Ashrama - <https://shop.advaitaashrama.org/product/the-life-story-of-sri-ramakrishna-ramchandra-dutta/>  

2\. [amazon.in](http://amazon.in) - <https://www.amazon.in/Life-Story-Sri-Ramakrishna/dp/8175054220>  

With regards,

Nagarajan K.
