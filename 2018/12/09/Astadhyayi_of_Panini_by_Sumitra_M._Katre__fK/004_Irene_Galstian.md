Thanks, Shankara.  
Taff, when you see the PDF please indicate if you still want scans  
done, or the link provided by Sankara answers your questions.  
My copy is also by Texas Uni, and the cover of the edition in your  
original post is of a Motilal edition. The issue is the quality of the  
binding, as it's the kind of book that gets opened and leafed through  
a lot.
