All,

  

 Thank you all for your advice, regarding*Astadhyayi of Panini: In Roman Transliteration (Texas Linguistics Series) Hardcover â€“ 1 Dec 1987*

  

I have managed to locate a second-hand copy here in the UK, of one that was published in the USA.

I have now bought it and expect it to arrive in the next few days.

  

Thanks again,

  

Taff Rivers
