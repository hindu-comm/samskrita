All,

  

 I am interested to hear from anyone who has experience of this English language tome(1400 pages).

  

Does it actually help the reader to find his own way around that mighty book of rules, without having to firstspend hisentire youth in the classroom?

I misspentmine in the Jazz clubs of London.

  

Thanks,

  

Taff Rivers
