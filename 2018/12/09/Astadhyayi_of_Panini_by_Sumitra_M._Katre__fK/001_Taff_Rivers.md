Irene,

  

'... but Katre alone isn’t enough to come to terms with Astadhyayi, in my opinion'.itiirene.  

  

I'd love to know how a **hh bhat**goes aboutit, he and his like are an endangeredspecies.

Perhaps he could avail himself of halfa dozen Englishghostwriters and document his experience, building on what Katre has done rather than startingfrom scratch.

TheAstadhyayi is for *writers* of Sanskrit, but an understanding would be of help to those who only want to accessthe wisdom contained in such as the darśana..

  

As for the scans. Yes, please.

There are two things I would need to know.

The quality of the print, as to its readability, decent font size etc.

And the style of writing - *not* as per J.H. Woods and his ilk.

  

Thanks for your advice.

  

Taff Rivers.
