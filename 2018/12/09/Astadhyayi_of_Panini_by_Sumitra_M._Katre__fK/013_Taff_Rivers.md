To all those interested,

  

 The Texas published hard-copy version has finally arrived, today.

  

It's of very good quality, print wise and material wise.

What's more, the pages remain flat when the book is opened, leaving both hands free.

  

It must be said that although the book uses English script including diacritics, the reader is left to his own devises as regards those words.

  

Viz.

  

1.1.I

 ... vṛd-dhir denotes denotes the vowel phonemes longā...  

  

But what's a***vṛddhir***?

Those free hands need to have an on-line dictionary handy, along with much free ***manas*** time.

  

  

All that remains now, is to read it...

  

 Regards
