These 120 videos are specifically aimed at spoken Sanskrit. There are no books which transcribe these videos word by word. But they can be connected with the 4 levels of Diksha series of books published by Rastriya Sanskrit Sansthan (RSkS). These books are invaluable for anyone who want to get introduced to Sanskrit. These books can be purchased at 40% discount from any of their 17 branches across in India and also from most of the Chinmaya centers.
