It is not पाणिनीयशिक्षा but प्रातिशाख्य that governs Vedic pronounciation.

  

  
  The Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya says: डढौ ळळ्हौ न माध्यन्दिनीयानाम्.
The change of intervocalic ḍ and ḍh to ḷ and ḷh does not happen in the Mādhyāndina Śākhā of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, but this change shows up in the Kāṇva Śākhā. It also is not recorded by Pāṇini. According to the R̥gveda Prātiśākhya this change is attributed to Vedamitra, but does show up in the Saṃhitā that goes under the name of Śākalya. 

  

  

It is not available in al shakha_s.
