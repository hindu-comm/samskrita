Ganesh,

  

Ashas been pointed out. It is not at all clear what to are wanting to know.

It's like you are asking 'How long is a piece of string'!  

  

Firstly, you have to recognise an adverb when you see one.

viz. 'to a good extent'

That usage of yours is adjectival asopposed noun, interjection or adverb.

Adverbially, it would read goodly. The suffix, ly, being the conventionalway to communicate such.

It is a literal device. Made for a particular purpose. Man-made.

  

So, are you asking for advice on how to recognise a Sanskrit indeclinable when you see one?

They are recognised by the absence of any trailing inflection. It is the convention.

  

Are you asking for a definition of a Sanskrit indeclinable?  

  

Do you have an adverbial or two in mind in a Sanskrit sentence that you reading?

Or are you writing one?
