Ganesh,

  

 This*reply provided* was not present in the forum at the time you raisedyour question!

  

You were asked, *what promptedyou* to initiate, thediscussion in the first case.

  

You are obliging members to guess what you mean.

  

I'm guessing.

  

How does anyone learn a second language?

Amongst others, I was taught Latin when in school.

  

Firstly, we had to learn Englishgrammar.

Then Latin grammar.

  

As to Panini.

He wrote in a highly technical sutra style in order to condense a vast quantity of grammatical information down to manageable proportions.

So, when it comes to Sanskrit, there are further steps:

  

Gain an understandingof the sutra style through reading the literature in yournative language.

Finally, obtain a native language commentary on the 4,000 sutras of Panini.

  

As to how to use such commentaries? That manual is yet to be written, and it is not difficult to see why.

  

Caveat emptor. Be warned. Difficult Is the word most associated withPanini.

  

A priori. Think.

  

Guru Taff Rivers.
