I would think that words in Sanskrit are mainly of two types - सप्रत्ययand अप्रत्यय

Although there is a contention, that अव्यय-s are सुबन्त-s there beingलोपः ofthe सुप्-प्रत्यय-s.

I think, it is simpler to take the अव्यय-sto be अप्रत्यय words.

-   By this outlook उपसर्ग-s, rather, the प्रादय-s, often seen
    un-affixed in Vedic texts qualify to be considered as अप्रत्यय words -   The प्रत्यय-s themselves, as words in grammatical texts are NOT
    अप्रत्यय words (!). They are declined with सुप्-प्रत्यय-s, e.g.
    plural of सुप् is सुपः, plural of कृत् isकृतः

The सप्रत्यय words will get classified by the classes of प्रत्यय-s.

The classes of प्रत्यय-s are सुप्,, तिङ्, कृत्, तद्धित, also विकरण-s

-   Some words containing कृत् and तद्धित प्रत्यय-s do further take
    सुप्-प्रत्यय-s.  
-   Some words with some कृत्-प्रत्यय-s such as क्त्वा तुमुँ stay that
    much. -   In लङ् and लुङ्लकार-s there is अ as आगम, which may be considered as
    itself, a class of प्रत्यय

Maybe, this proposal of considering words to be mainly of two types, सप्रत्ययand अप्रत्यय, is a radically new proposal. But if it can help simpler understanding, it should be worth a consideration.
