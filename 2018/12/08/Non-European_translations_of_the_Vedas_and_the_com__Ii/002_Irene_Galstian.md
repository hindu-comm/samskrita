Fair enough, Taff. Thanks for the link.  
  
Do you know if this Hindi translation of the bhashya is any good?  
  
<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/krsna-yajurveda-taittriya-samhita-only-edition-with-translation-of-sayana-s-commentary-set-of-2-volumes-NAI539/>  
  
Same question to everyone on the list. Your advice is sincerely appreciated.
