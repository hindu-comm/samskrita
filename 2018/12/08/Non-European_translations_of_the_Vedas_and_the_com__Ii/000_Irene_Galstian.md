As the subject states, I am looking for carefully done non-European  
translations of the Vedas and the major commentators (especially  
Sayana). What I am after is Sanskrit scholarship and a respectful  
attitude towards Indian traditions. Please could you post the  
translation(s) you've seen and found valuable.  
Many thanks,  
Irene
