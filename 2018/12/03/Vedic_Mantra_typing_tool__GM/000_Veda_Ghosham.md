Dear members,

  

I am looking for a user friendly, simple tool in which I can type Vedic mantras in Sanskrit with swara markings in an English keyboard of my laptop.

  

Also is there a electronic pad where I can write it and automatically it appears as typed version in Sanskrit on a laptop?

  

Regards

  

Ravishankar.
