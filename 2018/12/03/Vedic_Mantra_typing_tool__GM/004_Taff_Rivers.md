Ravi,

  

1. Perhaps you should mention that *lipikaar*is commercial software that costs₹299 per month to use.

2. That the free trial lasts for a mighty three full days.

3. That to obtain the devanagarifor dma, the user has to type the letter d, no less than 10 times,

  by stepping over dadha ḍa ḍha ddha dva dna dya dda **dma.**

4. That the dmais returned with half-forms asद्म.

5. That there is no way to obtain the dma as a ligature.

  

What kind of pidgin Sanskrit brand name is *lipikaar*!

  

Arghhh!

  

Taff Rivers.
