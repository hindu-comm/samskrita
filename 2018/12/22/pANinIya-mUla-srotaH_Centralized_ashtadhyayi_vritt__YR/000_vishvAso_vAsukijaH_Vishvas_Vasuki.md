Copying relevant parts over from <https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ui/about/> :  

  

this is[our centralized repository](https://github.com/sanskrit/ashtadhyayi)+[ui](https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ui/)of data pertaining to the ashtadhyayi and its commentaries.

  

### Motivation

This data is presented in many places on the internet (wikisource,[sanskritdocuments.org](https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ui/about/sanskritdocuments.org), avg-sanskrit,[ashtadhyayi.com](https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ui/about/ashtadhyayi.com)etc..), but there was no centralized place where corrections and curations could happen in a crowdsourced yet controlled fashion. Hence this repository.

  

### Contributing corrections

#### Via Github pull requests (preferred)

Follow the following steps (which only seem complicated at first, but are very simple):

-   Just click on the appropriate ‚úé (edit) icon.
    -   This will take you to a Github page, where you will be prompted
        to sign up/in, and ‚Äúmake a fork‚Äù as necessary. -   Make and save your edits. -   Send us a ‚Äúpull request‚Äù.
    -   Helpful videos:[here](https://youtu.be/YTbRzhQju4c?t=157).  
-   Some repository moderator will then review, accept your changes and
    regenerate the site.

#### Manual notification (not preferred).

Just[send us a message](https://github.com/sanskrit/ashtadhyayi/issues/new)(with the full corrected vritti text).

## UI

We use the Hugo static site generator to generate webpages, and github to host the site at<https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ui/>. The UI heavily copies shrI nIlesh‚Äôs[ashtadhyayi.com](https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ui/about/ashtadhyayi.com).
