Dear vidvaj-janas,

  

my pranams.

  

Since long it was my cherished desire to have soft-copies of all five volumes of Vyākaraṇa-candrodaya authored by Shri Charudeva Shastri. As most of you may be knowing, Vyakarana Chandrodaya is an excellent learning companion for all vidvāns, and it is composed of five volumes in totality. Volumes 2 and 5 were already available on the internet at the following links:

  

**Volume 2**: <https://archive.org/details/VyakaranaChandrodayaPartIICharuDevaShastri>

  

**Volume 5**: <https://archive.org/details/VyakaranaChandrodayaVCharudevaShastri_201709>

  

In 2016, I had managed to find first volume in an old bookstore, scan it and upload it on my archive page. Its link is as follows:

  

**Volume 1**: <https://archive.org/details/vyakarana_chandrodaya_1>

  

I tried to find the remaining volumes (3,4) unsuccessfully at various book stores and libraries in India, and even contacted the son of the author. Unfortunately however I failed to convince him to give his set of physical books for scanning.

  

Finally, good news is that a kind Gaudiya Vaishnava friend of mine staying in the US agreed to take the efforts to find the missing volumes and get them scanned for me.

  

I'm happy to inform all the vidvans that these remaining volumes have now been scanned and uploaded. Here are the links to the newly uploaded Volumes 3 and 4:

  

**Volume 3**: <https://archive.org/details/vyakarana_chandrodaya_3>

  

**Volume 4**: <https://archive.org/details/vyakarana_chandrodaya_4>

  

We now have all the volumes of Vyakarana Chandrodaya online, and I pray to Krishna that all the kind-hearted sāragrāhī vidvāns will be pleased with this effort.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari parshad das.

**विदितबन्धनपीड इवैष तौ**

**मुनिविनिग्रहतो यदमूमुचत् ॥**

  

**Translation**: \[Let anyone say that the highest favor on the Yamalārjuna trees was bestowed by Shri Krishna. However, for me\] it is certain that the greatest favor on the Yamalārjuna trees was bestowed by the radiant-bodied Mother Yashoda. \[It is only she who was able to tie Krishna to the mortar, and by doing so\] she made the eternally liberated Lord realize the pain of bondage, and as a result of understanding such pain, the Lord immediately delivered the two trees from the pain of bondage caused by the curse of the sage Narada.
