Dear Sir,

  

I am looking for the pdf or kindle version of the below book for purchase:

Dhtaurup Nandini of Sanskrit Bharati

<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/dhatu-rupa-nandini-ideal-for-sanskrit-reading-practice-sanskrit-only-NZE200/>

  

I checked for kindle version in amzon and for pdf version in [lulu.com](http://lulu.com). But it is not available.

  

Similar book is: Dhatupatha Handbook By Ashwini Kumar Aggarwal

This is an excellent book with font setting and formatting eye-catchy.I have bought kindle version of this from amazon.

  

I am not interested in paperback version.

  

Please help me finding the softcopy version of Dhtaurupa Nandini of Sanskrit Bharati

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
