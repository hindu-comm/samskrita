Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As Ardra Darashanam / Lord Nataraja Abhishekam falls on 23-Dec-2018 (Sunday), I am delighted to share a beautiful prayer by Lord Brahma to Lord Rudra taken from Kurma Puranam, Chapter 10. In this chapter, Lord Vishnu's conquest of Madhu and Kaitabha, Lord Brahma's birth from his navel, Lord Rudra's birth as Lord Brahma's son, the eight forms of Lord Rudra and consorts, attainment of Gyana by Lord Brahma through Lord Rudra and finally the message that Lord Rudra himself takes form as trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva) are explained in this brief chapter.

  

**brahma vishnu shivA brahman sarga-sthityanta-hetavaH \| vibhajyAtmAnaM aneko.api svecChaya sha\~NkaraH sthitaH \|\| 10-78 \|\|**

Meaning : ***Though Lord Shankara is ONE, he takes three forms (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) to facilitate creation, protection and destruction functions***.

  

In the attached hymn, Lord Brahma mentions that Lord Rudra Himself is the one who rests on the serpent and He is the one omni-present in every being.

  

We have seen that this is the message conveyed in every scripture and purana in countless forms and those who harbor difference among the trinity are deluded and fall into the hell.

  

May We pray to Lord Rudra with this beautiful stuti during Ardra Darshanam,
