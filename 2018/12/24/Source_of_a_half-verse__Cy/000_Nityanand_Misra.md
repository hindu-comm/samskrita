Dear list members

  

Does anybody know the second half and/or source of this half-verse?

  

ज्ञायते पितृपाण्डित्यं नामधारणकारणात्

  

Rough translation

(“पिता अथवा माता-पिता का पाण्डित्य \[उनके बच्चों के\] नाम धारण करने के कारण से जाना जाता है”)

(“The erudition of parents is known from the reason behind giving a name \[to their children\]”)  

  

My source:

In my conversation withthe honourable governor of Arunachal Pradesh Brig. (Dr.) B D Mishra, a veteran of several wars (62, 65, 71) and counter-insurgency operations (including against LTTE as part of IPKF) and an author, he recited this half-verse in the context of names given to children and said he had heard it in his childhood.My Google search led me to just 2-3 online sources and none of them has the other half of the verse or the source.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
