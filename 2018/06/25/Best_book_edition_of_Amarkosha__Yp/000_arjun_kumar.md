Hello All,

I was looking for some good edition of Amarkosha for beginner and to my surprise the best edition seems to be of 19 century publication first one by Colebrook (in English) and other by Devdutt tiwari(in Hindi). Apart from providing meanings that verse describe they also give gender and other grammatical information right in the verse itself.  

It’s pretty sad that in last 200 years no one came up with some good edition of Amarkosha which follow the pattern of Colebrook with commentaries like that of ksirsvamin translated either in English or Hindi.  
By chance do someone have any information of Amarkosa edition which follows pattern of Amarkosha translation by Colebrook (in English) with some detailed commentary so that it’s easy for beginner in sanskrit to get good grasp of Amarkosa.

Thanks in advance  
Arjun
