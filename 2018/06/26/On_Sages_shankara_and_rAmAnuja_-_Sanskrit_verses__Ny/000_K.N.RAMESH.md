# [श्रीशङ्कर-लक्ष्मण-मुनि-दशकम् - On Sages Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja](http://alarka-bhasitam.blogspot.com/2018/04/on-sages-sankara-and-ramanuja.html)

  
(Note: Prātasmaraṇīya is an expression in saṃskṛta to indicate the great respect that a personality has to be accorded. It can also be literally taken to indicate that one has to meditate upon the personalities waking up early in the morning. By that the mind gets purified. Both the meanings are intended in this set of verses)
