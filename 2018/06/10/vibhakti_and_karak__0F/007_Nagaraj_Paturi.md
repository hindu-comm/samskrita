Coming to the point the prepositional function and adverbial function have several things in common and that is the reason the difference between a prepositional phrase and adverbial phrase is sometimes blurring.

  

"Most adverbial phrases are prepositional phrases functioning as an adverb, modifying a verb, an adverb and an adjective."  

  

Professional linguists have been struggling to handle this tricky issue of distinnguishing between prepositional functions and adverbial functions wherever they overlap.

  

From a Sanskrit vyaakaraNa point of view, prepositions are kaarakabodhakas.

  

kaaraka is a relation between noun and verb or vice versa.

  

Bhartrihari views it as roles of entities in events.

  

Since adhikaraNa kaaraka has des'aadhikaraNa and kaalaadhikaraNa varieties (apart from vaishayika and abhivyaapaka adhikaraNa varieties), des'aadhikaraNa and kaalaadhikaraNa coincide with what in English are called adverbs of place adverbs of time.

  

For that matter, at a philosophical level, it can be argued that all preposition meanings that is, all kaarakas are adverbial in nature.
