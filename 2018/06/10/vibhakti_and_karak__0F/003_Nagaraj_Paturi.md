Dear Sri Praksh-ji,

  

Your list is almost correct . But "Object of" is not required.

  

Thus you might want to have the list as

  

1\. The subject of the verb in the sentence: प्रथमा

  

2\. The object: द्वितीया

  

3 For "by": तृतीया

  

4\. For "to"/"for" : चतुर्थी

  

5\. For "from": पञ्चमी

  

6\. For "of"; षष्ठी

  

7\. For "in, ": सप्तमी

  

-------

  

This is OK to begin with.

  

But the usages of Vibhaktis are more and you will have to learn them from a good grammar book.

  

Panini gives all the sutras. Your Sanskrit grammar book may quote those sutras.
