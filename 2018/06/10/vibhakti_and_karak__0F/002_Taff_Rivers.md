slabhyankar,

  

 I'm afraid that discourse of yours does not pass an English Grammar examination, any more that your Sanskrit does.

  

“in the morning” is *not* an adverbial phrase. It is is a prepositional one.

  

'parts of speech are not classes of words'. Parts of speech *are indeed*classes of words!

  

  

For remedial study, a simple dictionary is all that's required.

  

Just take a look at what Webster's has to say about 'in' and 'part of speech'.
