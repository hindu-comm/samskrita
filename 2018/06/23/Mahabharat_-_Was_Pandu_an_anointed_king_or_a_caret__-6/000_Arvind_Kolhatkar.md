Dear Group,

  

I would like to know, with specific reference to the Parva and Adhyaya from the [BORI critical edition](https://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/unic/mbh01_sa.html), whether Pandu was actually the anointed (अभिषिक्त) King for the Kuru Kingdom or was he an agent/caretaker for his brother who, because of his blindness, was unable to personally rule? Similarly, what is the position about Duryodhan? Was he an anointed King or a caretaker by default for his father?

  

I hope scholars here will point out proper sources for these questions.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
