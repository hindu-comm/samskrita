The jury is still out on the question of succession!

Pandu's ascent to the throne was 'constitutional' as laws of that era stood.

Yudhishthira's succeeding on Pandu's death was what rankled Duryodhana, who was elder to Yudhishthira by 1 year, but sought to redress it by exiling him (for 13 years) fraudulently.

  

Duryodhana's 'usurping' the throne precipitated the war, the strict

constitutionalists for and the righteous against!

Yudhishthira was willing even to abdicate and survive in 5 huts, one for each brother. Duryodhana refused to yield even a speck of land ('covering a point of a pin').
