नमस्ते  

Inspired by my uncle, I decided to write श्रीराम 10M times as my grand father also did it in his lifetime.  

Instead of writing on paper I decided to do on iPad with GoodNotes app.  

Attached is the template, with zoom feature I could write 10k per page. Without zoom 1k per page. People who want to write can print the second page as needed as well. 1k per page makes count very  

  

After many tries I came upto this template. I finished my first 100,000. I hope it helps others who wish embark on this journey.  

  

Just to put it in perspective if you write 1,000 a day without missing a single day it will take 27.4 years to complete it. Good luck  

  

जय श्रीराम ।

धन्यवाद: - राम
