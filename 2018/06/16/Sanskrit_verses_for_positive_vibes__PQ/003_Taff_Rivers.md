Sai Bala,

  

The *Gita* gives you the inspiration, but the nitty-gritty of what you are looking for is found in verses!\_30 thru 1_40 of the *Yoga Sutras*.  

  

There are listed the catalogue of woes that come our way, and most importantly - their antidotes.  

  

  

Prevention being better than cure, the advice given is to avoid getting into those negative situations in the first place...

... and we are told *how* to do just that.

  

However, human nature being what it is .. there is the cure as well.

  

  

  

Antarāya

   I. 30
Vyādhi-styāna-saṃśaya-pramāda-ālasya-avirati-bhrāntidarśana-alabdhabhūmikatva-anavasthitatvāni citta-vikṣepāḥ te-antarāyāḥ.

   I. 31 Duḥkha-daur-manasya-aṅgam-ejaya(-tva)-śvāsa-praśvāsāḥ vikṣepa-sahabhuvaḥ.

eka-tattva-abhyāsaḥ

   I. 32 Tat pratiṣedha-artham eka-tattva-abhyāsaḥ.

   I. 33 Maitrī-karuṇā-muditā-upekṣāṇām sukha-duḥkha-puṇya-apuṇya-viṣayāṇām bhāvanātaḥ citta prasādanam.

   I. 34 Pracchardana-vidhāraṇābhyām vā prāṇasya.

   I. 35 Viṣayavatī vā pravṛttiḥ utpannā manasaḥ sthiti-nibandhanī.

   \[nibandhana\].

   I. 36 Viśokā vā jyotiṣ-matī.

   I. 37 Vīta-rāga-viṣayam vā cittam.

   I. 38 Svapna-nidrā-jñāna-ālambanam vā.

   I. 39 Yathābhimata-dhyānāt vā.

   I. 40 Paramāṇu-parama-mahattva-antaḥ-asya vaśīkāra(ḥ).

  

Those verses are of course available in numerous formats, and degrees of elucidation.

  

Remember though, that whatever *they* say, we are our own best teachers-YS 1_26.

  

Best wishes
