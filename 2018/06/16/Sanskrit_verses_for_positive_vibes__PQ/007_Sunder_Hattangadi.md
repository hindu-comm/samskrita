भगवद्गीता :

जरामरणमोक्षाय मामाश्रित्य यतन्ति ये।

ते ब्रह्म तद्विदुः कृत्स्नमध्यात्मं कर्म चाखिलम्।। ७.२९ ।।

  

इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यम् अनहङ्कार एव च।

जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधि-दुःखदोषानुदर्शनम्।। १३.८ ।।

  

....ज्ञान-हेतुत्वाद् ज्ञानमुच्यते जन्मादि-दुःख-दोषानुदर्शनम्।।
(Shankara Bhashya))

The Buddha's Practical Approach:

  

"Suppose someone was hit by a poisoned arrow and his friends and relatives found a doctor able to remove the arrow. If this man were to say, 'I will not have this arrow taken out until I know whether the person who had shot it was a priest, a prince or a merchant, his name and his family. I will not have it taken out until I know what kind of bow was used and whether the arrowhead was an ordinary one or an iron one.' That person would die before all these things are ever known to him."

  

In the same way, those who say they will not practise the Dharma until they know whether the world is eternal or not, infinite or not, will die before these questions are ever answered.

  

The Buddha did not answer these questions because they are not relevant to the problems of suffering, nor do they lead to happiness, peace and Enlightenment. Whether one believes that the world is eternal or not, or that it is infinite or not, one has to face the reality of birth, old age, sickness, death and suffering. The Buddha explained suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering and the path leading to the end of suffering here and now. The Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths because He knew that they lead to happiness, peace and Enlightenment.
