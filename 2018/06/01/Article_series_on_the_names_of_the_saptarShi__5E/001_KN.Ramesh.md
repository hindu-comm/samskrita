Very well written sir and a nice unheard story on Greed.

  

\>\>As per the*sandhyā*practice followed in the tradition of*Yajurveda*, the*ṛṣi*‑s of the seven*vyāhṛti*‑s (“utterances”)*bhūḥ*,*bhuvaḥ*,*svaḥ*,*mahaḥ*,*janaḥ*,*tapaḥ*, and*satyam*are Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvāja, Gotama, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, and Kaśyapa, respectively.

  

  

No sir.. we recite bhUrAdi saptavyahrutInaam atri, bhrugu, kutsa, vasishta, gautama, kashyapa, Angirasa rushayah during sandhyavandanam .In dakshina bharat this is the tradition followed.

This tallies well with<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saptarishi>what is stated here.

  

Probably in maharashtra / marathi tradition what you have written may be followed I feel..

  

  

Sapta rishis are the first to be taught with yoga asana..

In Isha foundation coimbatore, near the 133 feet Adi yogi statue there is a sculpture depicting 7 rishis worshipping Shiva in 7 different asanas.. and this does not tally with the photo given in this link;
