*We have to identify them using dictionary and by practice. Am I right?  
  
eg.  
एको दाशरथि*: *कामं यातुधाना*: *सहस्रश*: । ते तु यावन्त एवाजौ तावांश्च ददृशे स तै: ॥४५॥  
From raghuvamsa 12th sarga  
  
In the above sloka *कामं &* *सहस्रश*: are treated as avyayas in this month samskruta sri magazine.  
  
I referred to dictionary **कामं is given as indecl. and* सहस्रश*: adverb and सहस्रशस् avyaya..

  

Is a pratipaadikam used in a sentence directly ?  
  
I thought *कामं as dviteeya vibhakti of* **काम* and found it as indecl. how to come out from this sort of confusions ?*
