Here is a link to a set of 120 video lessons to startlearning spoken Sanskrit. It was the flagship productof Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan in the yesteryears. They used to sell it in DVDs. Now it is available for FREE in their website. <http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/sanskrit_language_teaching.php>

  

Though you get some level of command on spoken Sanskrit, you cannot expect to get mastery in Sanskrit grammar through this course. Please check it and let me know whether it meets your requirement or not.
