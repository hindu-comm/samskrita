Nice. Based on this it should be possible to develop a program which gives any other inflected form when an inflected form is input. It should designate the coordinates of the input inflected form and give the inflectedform for any other set of coordinates. If I input "raamaaya" it should say "Raama" is praatipadikaand the form is masculine chaturthiekavachanaand I should be able to query, say, panchamidvivacana. Similarly for verbs.

Regards,

Murthy
