If you've reading fluency in an Indian language, you probably don't have to rely on grammatical terms used in Latin to learn Sanskrit grammar.

  

I started with a book such as the one by Goldman but when I found that my mother-tongue (Malayalam) had many books on Sanskrit Grammar, I decided to give them a try. Much to my surprise, I found that, on the whole, it was much easier to learn sanskrit grammar through my language than through English.  

  

A simple example: 'locative absolute' was referred to simply as 'sati saptami'. How mnemonic this term is!

  

Hence, to repeat: if you're from India and have reading fluency in one of its languages, check out Sanskrit grammars written in your own language. You might be pleasantly surprised!  

  

As an added bonus, you probably won't have to split a fine hair between constructions such as prepositions and adverbs! :-)
