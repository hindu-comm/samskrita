sunder,

  

 Thanks,

  

 That's what I suspected.

I not only searched around online, but through many such books on my own bookshelf, to no avail.

  

No such 'dangling participles'*by name,*but *in reality* there are many, and that is what matters, along with their even more troublesome cousins *dangling modifiers.*

  

In my reply to pshoopla's post, *Absolute* is dangling - as it leaves unsaid what (word or words) do so dangle.

MoreoverAbsolute, *modifies* something, but what that something is, is left to the imagination of the reader to supply.

  

*All*, is an absolute (as compared with *most* or *some*) - it is a dangling *modifier*, but*what* does it modify.

  

That so much Sanskrit literature abounds in these things, is the cause of diverse byasa's on even a single verse.

  

What would be most worth finding is abhāṣya, sub-bhāṣya, sub-sub-bhāṣya.... where the commentator admits that he/she doesn't have a clue what the sutra means.

But I'm not holding my breath.

  

Regards,
