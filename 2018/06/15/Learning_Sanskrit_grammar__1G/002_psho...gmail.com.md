Hi,

  

Here's one such book:

  

<https://ia802707.us.archive.org/29/items/Kamadhenu-Sanskrit-Tutor-Malayalam/kamadhenu.pdf>

  

I've gone through other books also. I'll compile a list and send to you.

  

By the way, is there a way on this forum to send a reply just to one person? I think this topic might not be of general interest and I do not want to send this compiled list to all.

  

Look at this title:

  

<https://books.google.com/books/about/Paniniya_pradyotam.html?id=9RmaPgAACAAJ>  

  

This book won Sahitya Academy Award (Malayalam) in 1956. It's considered a great work on Panini's grammar rules and is written in Malayalam. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a copy of this book because it's been long since out of publication.

  

Here's another great book written in Malayalam, again on Panini's grammar:

  

<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Prakriya-bhashyam-Sanskrit-originally-Malayalam/dp/B0000CP7B5>  

  

Best,

  

Praveen
