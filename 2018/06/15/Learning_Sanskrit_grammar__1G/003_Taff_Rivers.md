pshoopla,

  

In association with the Sanskrit'locative absolute'there is something that English calls 'dangling participles'.



I don't know the Sanskrit for this term (can anyone help me here?), but the both of them were referenced a year and a half ago in this forum by <https://ia801909.us.archive.org/18/items/SatiSaptami/sati%20saptami.pdf>

  

For non-dangling participles you may want to google for 'ps hoopla', especially as you are of a humorus disposition.

I understand that there are many such upstanding in India (:-).
