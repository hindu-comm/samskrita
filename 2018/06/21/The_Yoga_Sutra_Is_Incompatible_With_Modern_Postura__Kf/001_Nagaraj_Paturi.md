1, This is a beaten track discussion presented as fresh and news. That the postural Yoga is different from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and that ppostural Yoga is connected to what is called as Hatha Yoga discussed in books such as Hatha Yoga Pradipika and GheranDa Samhitaa is very well known.

  

2\. We can say that the author has a wrong understanding of Yoga Sutras because he says,

  

"*yogah-citta-vritti-nirodha*. It means yoga is the cessation of sense experiences. To elaborate, the*sutra*says that the objective of yoga is to stop the flow of thoughts or sense experiences. In this case, the very foundation of what science is all about is destroyed, if only because science and its methods rest on empirical experiences."

  

Chitta vritti Nirodhah is being translated as cessation of sense experiences; the translation is wrong.

  

Swami Vivekananda's translation is "Yoga is restraining the mind stuff (Chitta) from taking various forms(Vrittis)"

  

3\. Yoga Sutras is being used for a scientific discipline called Psychology since it is to that discipline that the subject matter of Yoga Sutras belongs. To say that Yoga Sutras is incompatible with science is to say something like Freud is incompatible with Physics.
