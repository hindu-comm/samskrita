This is an insubstantial claim. The Yoga Sutras are perfectly compatible with modern postural yoga. Those who claim otherwise have either not studied the Yoga Sutra or have not practised yogasana and pranayama.  
  
Please refer to all the ancient sculptures and images of Tirthankaras, yogis and siddhas. They are seated or standing in yogic postures.  
  
Modern postural yoga owes a great deal to Hatha Yoga. But nothing in the Yoga Sutra is incompatible with or runs contrary to modern postural yoga.  
  
Yogadarshana is a philosophy. Expecting philosophy to be compatible with science is silly! Can philosophy or theology be compatible with science?
