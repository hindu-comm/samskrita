Namaste,

  

The first paada is not translated properly. A complete translation of this subhashita, copied from Sadasvada group is given below.

  

It gives strength to go around, makes one able to bear hot and cold, and kindles digestion \[literally, lights a fire in the stomach\] -- surely, poverty is the best medicine!

regards  
shankara
