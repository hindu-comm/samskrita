Dear all,

  

I usually search for a word in acrobat reader with ctrl+f. then a dialog box comes.  

There if I give the input in Devanagari, even though the word is available in front of me, acrobat is not recognising it.

I tried typing the word in English with KH notation, then also it is not recognising.

  

Hence the query , how to search a sanskrit word in pdf file which is in devanagari?

  

thanks

namaskarams
