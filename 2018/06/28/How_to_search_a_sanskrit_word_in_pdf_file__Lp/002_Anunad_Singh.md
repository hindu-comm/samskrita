I use two methods to search Devanagari text in a pdf file (non-image).  
  
(1) Suppose you see some word 'xyz' in front of you in the file, take  
cursur there and copy it and paste into the search box. Do search  
forward/backward as usual.  
  
(2) Suppose you know the font of the Sanskrit text. Suppose it is  
Krutidev10. (A very high fraction of Devanagari pdf files are in  
Krutidev10). Open a Krutidev \<==> Devanagari converter. Suppose you  
want to search दण्डसंहिता in the pdf text. Convert दण्डसंहिता to  
Krutidev. Copy the Krutidev text in the search box.....  
  
This technique is very effective in searching devanagari material by  
Google search too. Keep Krutidev \<==> Devanagari converter in front  
of you and convert the search results into devanagri using the  
converter. reading few sentences of the search result, you can guess  
which link you should follow.
