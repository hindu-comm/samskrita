KN Ramesh,

  

The Devnag *font* will need to be installed on your own particular computer device.

  

When *displaying* the content, the problem font will be embedded in the pdf file, along with its built- in hypertext tags to tell the pdf reader to switch language fonts.

  

To *search* the content for Devanagari - you have to write in Devanagari - if your system is able to....

  

**First** you could try and copy a string of Devnag from the text and paste that into the search box.

If you see garbage characters, you have some work to do....

  

  

**Fonts**?

  The reader will tell you:

  

For Foxit Reader for example I access the its main menu:

  

File, then Properties, then Fonts.

  (Adobe is much the same)

  

 Voila! all the required fonts are listed.

  

It's up to you to **find those fonts** on the internet, download and
install them.

  

Then, I assume you have a utility to **switch keyboard language,**

you must **switch to a suitable font on your device** before you can type away.

  

That's it!

  

Tecnical point, if you use a slow mobile or such.

Embedded fonts contain only the characters that it actually uses, to reduce file size.

Downloaded fonts may be bi-, tri- multi- lingual... and much bigger.
