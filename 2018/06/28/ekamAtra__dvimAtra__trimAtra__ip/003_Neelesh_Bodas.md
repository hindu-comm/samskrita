Is there a difference in "Maatraa of Chandas" and "Maatra of Vyakarana" ? Or they are one and the same?

So essentially,ऐ is pronounced a little "quicker" thanए ? That's interesting to know!

Can you please throw more light on how to count matras? You said अस्थिर = अस् + थि + र . Hereअस् = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5. But at the same timeथि = 1 (so we just ignoreथ्) is that because it is before the swara?



Can you recommend some text that I can read and get a deeper understanding on all these things?
