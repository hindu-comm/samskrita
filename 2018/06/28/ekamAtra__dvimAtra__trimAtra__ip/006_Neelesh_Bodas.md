Yes I would like to know more about maatraa in chandas vs maatra in vyakaranam. The panini sutra 1.2.27 or the commentaries there in do not answer the questions that I posed earlier.

  

Prof. Paturi did give answers to most of my questions (thanks!), but a few questions still remain.  

  

Regards
