maatraa in Chandas is a measure of time taken for pronunciation of the syllable.

  

Time taken for one wink of an eye is called one maatraa.

  

maatraa here means unit.

  

Time taken for pronouncing hrasva is one maatraa; for deerghas it is two maatraas.

  

ए is 2maatraas not because it isअ + इ; but because it is deergha and takes two units of time to pronounce.  

  

ऐ is almost like अय् and takes one and half units of time but is counted as two maatraas.

  

raama is deergha + hrasva = two maatras + one maatra = total three maatraas.

  

to pronounce raama as raam is wrong.

  

asthira is to be taken as as +thi + ra two maatraas (one and a half but taken as two) +one maatraa + one maatraa

  

Two maatraas is counted as guru and one maatraa is counted as laghu.

  

सैकत, अंकित, दुःखित, स्थापित, मानित are all UII only ; U stands for guru, I stands for laghu. Hence all these words are counted as bha gaNa.
