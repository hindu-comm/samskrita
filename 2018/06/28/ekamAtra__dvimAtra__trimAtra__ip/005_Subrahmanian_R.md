Sirs,

  

I am also eager to know the answer to the fourth question of Sri Neelesh Boda viz

How should one pronounce a plutamaatraa? For example, is अ3 pronounced as elongated अ or elongated आ ?

In MS Subbulakshmi's rendering of Jayadeva Ashtapati (Dasavataram) it is clearly elongated अ. I observe that in certain other occasions (in Ashirvachana) it is more like elongated आ .
