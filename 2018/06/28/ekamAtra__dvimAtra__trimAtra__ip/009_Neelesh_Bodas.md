Q: Why did you break it asपार् + थिव and not पा + र्थि + व? Is there any rule?

  

Q: Also, in reference to one of your previous comments that ए = 2 and ऐ = 1.5, why does shiksha say that ए and ऐ are both 1.5 ? am I missing something?

अर्धमात्रा तु कण्ठस्य एकार-ओकारयोर्भवेत् । Paniniya Shiksha 13/14/15.

  

Q: Where does karika "एकमात्रो भवेद्ह्रस्वो द्विमात्रो दीर्घ उच्यते" appear? I could only findह्रस्व-दीर्घ-प्लुतो इति कालतः नियमाः अचि in shiksha. Tattvabodhini says in 3.2.57'एकमात्रो ह्रस्वो व्यञ्जनं त्वर्द्धमात्रक'मिति सर्वसंमतत्वात्. Not sure whose is thisसर्वसंमतत्व of.

Q: Does त्रिमात्रिक mean "3 times theएकमात्रा"or does त्रिमात्रिक mean "3 or more timesएकमात्रा"

  

  

Looks like I am mixing lots of things here -

  

1\) Ekamatra vs dvi-matra vs tri-matra

2\) Hrasva vs Deergha vs Pluta

3\) Laghu vs Guru

  

This is what I got so far

  

एकमात्र = ह्रस्व

द्विमात्र = दीर्घ

त्रिमात्र = प्लुत

दीर्घ = गुरु

ह्रस्व = लघु

ह्रस्व followed by संयुक्ताक्षर = गुरु

  

Isह्रस्व followed by संयुक्ताक्षरएकमात्र orद्विमात्र ?

  

Sorry for the chaos.
