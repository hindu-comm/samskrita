Dear Scholars

  

There is some confusion in my mind about the concepts ofएकमात्र / द्विमात्र / त्रिमात्र etc. What I have read is that अ, इ, उ have 1 maatraa and आ, ई, ऊ have 2maatraa. Now scholars also say thatए is 2maatraabecause ए = अ + इ (simple addition of 1+1 = 2).

  

Q1) Is it correct to do such additions for countingmaatraa? If so, then ए = आ + ई will become 4maatraa, andऐ = अ + ए will then become 5maatraa. And then we can create an infinite-maatra ऐ by pure recursion. ( ऐ = अ + ऐ). Is that right?

  

Q2) How should one exactly count matras? Should one just remember them (Likeअ = 1, आ = 2 etc) or is there any logic ? Are there matras like 4,5,6,7,8,... etc?

  

Q3) Domaatraadirectly relate to the time for which syllable is spoken? (वां काल इ व कालः)

  

Q4) How should one pronounce a plutamaatraa? For example, is अ3 pronounced as elongated अ or elongated आ ? And why so?

  

Q5) Consider a simple wordराम. What is the correct way of pronouncing it -

\(A\) "Raam" (Like what we say in Hindi. This has a little less-than-full pronunciation of the letter M)

OR

\(B\) "Raama" (which has a full ह्रस्व M)

  

PS: Any authoritative texts backing the answers will be much appreciated, so that I can look them up for any subsequent questions.

  

Thanks

Neelesh
