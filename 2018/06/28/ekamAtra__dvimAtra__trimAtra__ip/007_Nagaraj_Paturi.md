I was away teaching.

  

------------------------------

  

OK, coming back to the discussion, maatraas in vyaakaraNa are the same as those in Chhandas.

  

----------------

  

pluta is not found in varNamaalaa.

  

It is found in actual phonemic sequences in words.

  

For example, पार् in पार्थिव takes two and a half maatraas time. Because it is more than two maatraas it is taken as pluta. But in metrical calculations , it is counted as guru only.

  

In laukika Samskrita, it has not got much significance.

  

But in Veda, it has got significance.

  

It is often considered that the elongation at the end of names for the purposes of sambodhana is of pluta length.
