Respected Dr. Bhat,

it is my interest to find the words and how they come into use. When we learn literature there are two choices.

1\. take popular meaning for example (deva = god) and move on with life

2\. find that it is derived from दि॑वुँ॑क्रीडाविजिगीषाव्यवहारद्युतिस्तुतिमोदमदस्वप्नकान्तिगतिषु this dhatu and try to find various usages and how different words came into usage. This mental exercise gives me joy. When I get stuck i have to reach out to for help.

  

You may argue that step 2 is total waste of time, from my perspective step 1 does not add much value either.
