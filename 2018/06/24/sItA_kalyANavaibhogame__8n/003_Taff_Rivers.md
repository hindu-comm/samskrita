Nagaraj Paturi,  

  

तरणि

  

Not to be taken literally, this is poetry, after all.

  

In the context, a little poetic imagination is required, not to mention some sandhi change for metrical purposes.

  

  

Aplying a little reverse engineering, I get:  

  

taraṇi as an adjective, not a noun.

 taraṇi being a variation of f. = °ṇī, *a boat*, Prab. Vop. Śatr.

  

the MW glosses taraṇias,

  

• mfn. moving forwards (as the sun &c.), quick, untired, energetic, ṚV. AV. xiii, 2, 4 and 36.

**. . .**

• cf. go-, saṃsāra-. \[438,3\]

  

The context has saṃsāra - the general idea of that song is that of *crossing over*.

  

taraṇi derives from tara

  

tara

• mfn. (√ tṝ; g. pacādi) carrying across or beyond, saving (?, said of Śiva), MBh. xii, 10380.

• ifc. passing over or beyond, W.

**. . .**

• a raft, W.



And the dhatu tṝ

  

to pass across or over, cross over (a river), sail across, ṚV. &c.

  

I am applying my formal training in poetic de-composition in English literature to to another language.

  

It works the same, metaphorics, analogies, archaic vocabulary and idioms' s being of the mental world, the mind being universal.

  

I rest my case.
