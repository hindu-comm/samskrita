Is this the Apte entry you are referring to - Page 783 has this for **तॄ**

  

**तॄ** 1 P. (तरति, ततार, अतारीत्, तरि-री-ष्यति, तीर्ण)

  1 To cross over, cross; केनोडुपेन परलोकनदीं तरिष्ये Mk.8.23; स तीर्त्वा कपिशाम् R.4.38; Ms.4.77.

  -2 (a) To cross over, traverse (as a way); (अध्वानं) ततार ताराधिपखण्डधारी Ku.7.48; Me.19.

    (b) To sail across, navigate (as a river).

**           . . .**

  

And where do I find your *'**rays of the sun as per Apte*' - what is the headword under which you found that meaning?

  

Myself, if I were a song writer, I would prefer the more existential 'rays of light' to the burning hot rays of the sun.

  

  

Best,
