Nagaraj Paturi,

  

My concern is the meaning of the words of a song.

  

KN.Ramesh mentions an entry in Apte's lexicon, but does not give the details as to where I may find it.

  

==>

KN.Ramesh Sorry.. Read it as तृ + अनि and not अन् Meaning rays of the sun as per Apte  

==>

  

My point is that the word in most versions of the song parses as ***tara**-*, the etymology of which has nothing to do with 'the **sun**'.

In other words, the particular Devanagari quote, is unreliable an unrepresenative, and shouldn't be used as a basis for interpretation.

  

Perhaps you are able to point me to the relavant Apte 'sun' entry?

  

Songs are for enjoying, but when the words don't sound right.. thought arise!  

  

Best,

  

Taff_Rivers

  

And where do I find your*'**rays of the sun as per Apte*' - what is the headword under which you found that meaning?
