Taff Rivers,

  

We are all concerned with the meaning of the words of a song only.

  

As far as enjoing the song is concerned,

  

this is a devotional lyric sung in classical Carnatic style. Enjotment comes from the

  

1\. Music

  

2\. Bhakti

  

3\. Naamasamkeertana

  

These three are interwoven into each other.

  

परमेशनुतकीर्ति भवजलधिपोत , तरणिकुलसंजात त्यागराजनुत

  

has four naamas, परमेशनुतकीर्ति, भवजलधिपोत , तरणिकुलसंजात and
त्यागराजनुत

  

There is second syllable rhyme and end syllable rhyme between the two lines

  

परमेशनुतकीर्ति भवजलधिपोत

  

and

  

तरणिकुलसंजात त्यागराजनुत

  

There is a bonus end syllable rhyming between the two words

  

तरणिकुलसंजात and त्यागराजनुत also.  

  

These s'abdaalamkaaras add to the samkeertanabhaktyaananda (bliss from uttering such sweet sounding names of our upaasya taatva/dEvataa) and s'ravaNabhaktyaananda (bliss from hearing such sweet sounding names of our upaasya taatva/dEvataa) that comes from the divinely composed music.

  

For most devotees (devotees are the target audience) , the meaning of these naamas is of not much concern.

  

(If you watch tarangam classical dance and the apparent disconnect between the naama sung and the sanchaari performed, you can understand this)

  

Naamasankeertanaaananda and naamas'ravaNaananda is their only concern.

  

(Girlfriend enjoys the act of calling her boy friend not the meaning of the name(s) through which she calls him. Parents enjoy the act of calling their baby not the meaning of the name(s) through which they call it. Sometimes, they create some meaningless names too of the baby in their fit of overflowing love for the baby.)

  

Those who are interested in the meaning of the names, take the meaning of taraNikulasamjaata as sooryavams'asamjaata only.

  

for them, as Dr Bhat pointed out, rooDhaartha (connotation) is enough. Etymology is not required.

  

Looking for etymology is post-Bhaktyaananda or outside the bhaktyaananda intellectual exercise. That is neither required for the enjoyment nor does it come in the way of enjoyment.

  

No parsing software can help bhaktyaananda.

  

Parsing softwares as on now are not capable of capturing all the nuances of word formations in languages, particularly Sanskrit. You can not prioritise them over praamaaNika panDitas and their knowledge of Sanskrit.

  

If the etymology of taraNi does not match with the idea in the previous line called the boat for (crossing) the bhavajaladhi (= ocean of cycle births and deaths), it does not match. Matching, if exists is a beauty. If it dioes not exist is not a lacuna. In this case praamaaNikapanDitas derive taraNi =sun not taraNee = boat from tr +ani . So there is no matching between the meanings of taraNi and bhavajaladhipota . That does not matter at all for enjoyment that I explained above.
