There are so many versions of this song. (seetaa kalyaaNa vaibhOgamE)

  

The word is not 'the sun,' but the'solar race' (people of the Earth - the human race).

People embodied in their human form, are to be freed from their material prison that is the Earth, as this translation, with its bad English, has it:

  

 He is the raft enabling deserving mortals to cross the ocean of SamsAra.

 That is the aim of His incarnation in the solar race, He whom TyAgarAja worships.**

**

It's not at all a romantic rendering, but it should give the generalidea.

A better poetical Devanagari version, plus Latin transliteration along with theetymological derivation, I leave to the learned ones.

How grand and imposing the wedding of SIta is!

Praised by AnjanEya, this Hero of countless exploits,

having the sun and the moon as His eyes, and possessing a frame of ravishing beauty is an unfailing Protector of His devotees and Bestower of prosperity and Beatitude, which is a part of His LIlas.

He causes terror in the minds of RAkshasas.

His calmness and composure reveal Him as one who has no more desires to be fulfilled.

Sporting a radiant blue hue, He is the source of Bliss for the world.

Resider of AyOdhya, He is the Prop of the entire world.

A peerless warrior in battles, He is beyond the ken of men of arrogance and haughtiness.

He is tall and courageous, reminding one of the great Mount MEru.

He is the Hero figuring in the Scriptures.

With an unmatched form, He is the mainstay of His devotees, whose sins He wipes out graciously.

Celebrated by Lord Siva in song and music,

  

He is the raft enabling deserving mortals to cross the ocean of SamsAra.  

That is the aim of His incarnation in **the solar race**, He whom TyAgarAja worships.
