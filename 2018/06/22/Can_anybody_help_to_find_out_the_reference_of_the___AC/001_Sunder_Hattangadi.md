मोक्षो रजस्तमोऽभावात् बलवत्कर्मसङ्क्षयात्\| वियोगः सर्वसंयोगैरपुनर्भव उच्यते\|\|१४२\|\|

  

mōkṣō rajastamō'bhāvāt balavatkarmasaṅkṣayāt\| viyōgaḥ sarvasaṁyōgairapunarbhava ucyatē\|\|142\|\|

This is the stage of salvation in which there is detachment of sharira, mana, indriya and atma. Moksha or salvation is nothing but an absolute detachment of all contacts by virtue of absence of rajas and tamas in the mind and annihilation of effects of potent past actions/deeds. This is a state after which there is no more physical or mental contacts. Further there is no process of rebirth.\[142\]
