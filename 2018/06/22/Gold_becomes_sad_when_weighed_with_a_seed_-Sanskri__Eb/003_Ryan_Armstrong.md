नमस्कार  

  

If I may add my 2c...

Not being as proficient inसंस्कृतम् as most who post on this list (Cambridge A-levels is as far as I have come...so far) I find Sri RAMESH ji's posts extremely useful.

And even though the icons are sometimes excessive, they are useful for those who may not grasp the full meaning immediately.

Apart from that, I would prefer the soundसस्मितमुखम् to appear in mind rather than "smiley face" simply because it is more refined and a movement towards purity.

  

Besides, the only "pure" language is that of Absolute Silence - e.g. Sri Dakshinaamurthy

The relative purity of language is only its ability (or lack thereof) to reflect the Absolute purity of theआत्मन्

  

Kind Regards

Ryan
