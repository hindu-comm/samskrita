Taff, this is how it's written in Devanagari -  

ऐ, द गोल्ड् दट् इस् संस्कृत् हु इस् प्युर्, अम् नाट् हापि टु बि कण्डामिनेटेड् वित् स्मैल्स्, द प्राडक्ट् ओफ़् द इम्प्यूर्  

  

Fun and games aside, here's the point I'm making - many have criticized the use of distracting icons in KN Ramesh's messages (I happen to strongly agree with this criticism - I find the distracting icons silly). But he chooses to continue using them, as is his right. As Sitaraama put it, the rest of us have a right to ignore the messages as well. (For what it's woth, had I not been one of the moderators, I would simply ignore the posts).  

  

KN Ramesh, in my opinion, if you want the posts to be read more seriously, perhaps the focus should be on content and not attempts at cosmetics.  

Perhaps this shloka should serve as a reminder of what is beautiful -  

  

सरसिजमनुविद्ध शैवलेनापि रम्यं  
मलिनमपि हिमांशोर्लक्ष्म लक्ष्मीं तनोति।  
इयमधिकमनोज्ञा वल्कलेनापि तन्वी  
किमिव हि मधुराणां मण्डनं नाकृतीनाम्‌॥  

  

As an aside,  

To the members who have post one line, appreciative messages, it would perhaps be better to express your gratitude by changing the "To" in the email field to the poster, instead of the group.
