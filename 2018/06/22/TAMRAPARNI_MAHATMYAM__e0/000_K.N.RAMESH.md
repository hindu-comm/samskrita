As all are aware, TAMRAPARNI PUSHKARAM is being celebrated for 12 days from 12th to 23rd October 2018 at Kurukkutturai, Tirunelveli. There is a Puranam called **TAMRAPARNI MAHATMYAM** of 6400 slokas describing the origin of the river, the many Tirthaghattas in its course, the many stories connected with the Ghattas etc. There are many beautiful stotras of Devi in the Puranam.

  

As instructed by Srimatham, I prepared a book containing summary of the Puranam in English, together with the original Samskrit stotras. On Sunday, 17th June 2018, the books - this book in English and the book of original Samskrit Puranam - were released at Srimatham by Sri Bala Periyaval. Both books published by [www.simshuba.com](http://www.simshuba.com) at Chennai. Copies available with them.
