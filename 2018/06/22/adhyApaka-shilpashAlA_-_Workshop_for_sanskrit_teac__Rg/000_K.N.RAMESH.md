The Principal

  

  

Respected Sir / Madam,

Sub: Orientation Meeting / Workshop for Samskrit Teachers – 6, 7 July 2018.

  

One of the greatest leaders of Modern India, Swami Vivekanada vouchsafed the study of Samskrit by one all. To help the student community imbibe the rich values advocated in the language and help them converse in Samskrit a robust-Samskrit atmosphere inside the classroom with updated teaching tools becomes a pre-requisite.

  

Hence with support of Samskrit Promotion Foundation and Maharishi Vidyamandir, we propose to have an effective 2-days’ Workshop (Shilpashala) Samskrit Teachers on 6^(th) & 7^(th) July 2018 (Fri & Saturday) 9:00 am to 4:00 pm at Maharishi School, Guruswamy Road, Chetpet, Chennai (near: Pacchaiappas College) Chennai. Parallel sessions for teachers handling *Balabharati (Latika, Mrudula*, etc.) will also be held.

***Dr.Chandkiran Saluja, Director, SPF will be guiding the whole workshop.***

  

The meeting will feature a discussion forum on:

  

-   **Guide-liner on the nuances of teaching the new NCERT book –**
    ***Shemushi*** **(****शेमुषीः****)**

-   Updating teaching aids – making class room techno-savvy & guiding
    students communicate in Samskrit

-   Introducing games, rhymes, small songs in Samskrit

-   Effective Comprehensive Assessment of Students

*We request your good self to kindly depute your Samskrit teachers for the same.*
