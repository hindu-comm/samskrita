Valerio,

  

 The concept of *sin*is ancient.

  

If I may venture a secular and pragmatic description ofपाप, it is the*inclination to evil, held to be inherent in humankind*.

  

It is introduced in verses I.36 & 37 of the BG, albeit in its extreme form of *killing fellow humans.*

Where its fruit is unhappiness (in the form of guilt).

  

Such an unpleasant state arises out of a wide range of transgressions of human nature.

This is a given.

  

It is heldby some to hinder the ascent to a higher *sphere*.

  

Where that domain is understood in different ways by different individuals - as being the realm of the Lord or the realm of the mind.

īśvara can be understood as the Lord in heaven the lord of the manor, an earthly region.

Or lord of the *manas.*

  

More than mere words, are necessary.

**  
**

**How** to transcend this earthly realm is what matters.

  

Best,
