Dear Mr. Valerio Virgini,

  

Since you made your guess, I venture my guess about etymology of पाप to be fromधातुः पा and उपसर्ग अप. The logic is =>

-   Meaning ofधातुः पा is to protect, to care for
-   Meaning of उपसर्ग अप is away. -   पाप is what takes you away from **His** care and protection.  
-   The उपसर्ग is usually prefixed to theधातु. If so, it would be अपपा
-   But in वैदिक संस्कृतthe उपसर्ग is often separated from theधातु.
-   In पाप, not only that the उपसर्ग is separated, it is suffixed पा +
    अप= पाप -   May we grant that पाप is easier to pronounce than अपपाand became
    more popular ?
