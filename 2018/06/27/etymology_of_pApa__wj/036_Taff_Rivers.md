Valerio et al.

  

IsPāli the oldest language, older even than Vedic?

  

I came across an entry in an a Pāli-English .pdf file.

  

The Wikipedia entry on this subject is questionable and doesn't help:

  

  

**Pāpa** (adj. nt.) \[Vedic **pāpa**, cp. Lat. patior≈E. passion etc.; Gr.

  π¨ημα suffering, evil; ταλαίπωρος suffering evil\]

 **            . . .**

**  
**

There, we have *sin*, as an offense to the Deva,

and also, as *evil*, more of an offense to our fellow men.

  
To me, it seems that In practice*both* senses of the word, involve lack of control of our natural-born tendencies.

  

Regards,
