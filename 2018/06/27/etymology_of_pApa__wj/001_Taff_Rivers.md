Valerio,

  

You don't say who is translating, but since this is a Sanskrit forum. I assume your are referring to the Sanskrit lexicons.

Where 'sin' is indeed ***one*** of the meanings of **pāpa**\*.

Those lexicons are invariable *Indo-centric*.

  

There are also the global perspective of words, e.g. Old Persian, Jewish....

  

Judaic concepts are best sought on Jewish forums, where you will learn that 'any of 613 commandments' are regarded as a sin.

and that the word is a '**zoomorphism**' -

  Attributing animal form or other animal characteristics to anything other than an animal;

  similar to but broader than anthropomorphism.

  

Its all out there on google:
[**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_sin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_sin)

  

\***pāpa**

   • (ŚBr. xiv, also pāpa), mf (ī older than ā ; cf. Pāṇ. 4-1, 30 )n. bad, vicious, wicked, evil, wretched, vile, low, ṚV. &c. &c.

   • (in astrol.) boding evil, inauspicious, Var.

   • m. a wicked man, wretch, villain, ṚV. &c, &c.

   • N. of the profligate in a drama, Cat.

   • of a hell, VP.

   • (ā), f. a beast of prey or a witch, Hcat.

   • n. (ifc. f. ā) evil, misfortune, ill-luck, trouble, mischief. harm, AV. &c. &c. often śāntam_pāpam, 'heaven forefend that evil', R. Mṛcch. Kālid. &c. ).

   • **sin**, vice, crime, guilt, *Br. Mn. MBh. &c*.

   • (am), ind. badly, miserably, wrongly, AV.

   • (ayā), ind. id. ṚV. AV.

   • -papayāmuyā, so badly, so vilely, ib. \[618,2\]
