Nagaraj Paturi,

  

 I quote from
<https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/1/verse/36-37>

 Where ourपापis glossed there in 37, as**सुखिन:**

  

sukhin

  • mfn. possessing or*causing happiness or pleasure,* happy, joyful, pleasant, comfortable, easy, **MBh**. Kāv. &c.

  • m. a religious ascetic, W. \[1222,1\]

  

And the consequence of Fighting and killing are given as an:

 ungodly act that brings with it feelings of repentance and guilt,

  

The site is bi-lingual and is helpfully transcribed in three scripts.

  

Those that have travelled along the many ways that the BG, and of other testiments, speak of, are the ones know these things. Ask of them.

  

Concepts are invisible, dwelling as they do in the mind.

Everyone dwells in there, very few bother to follow any path.

  

Those that do, and glimse the invisble, will know so, when they see it.

  

That's where religion becomes a reality.

Nothing that you, I or anyone can *s*ay, however insistantly, change the reality.

  

Not everyone sinks down in their chariot, over come with dispair and grief.

  

Most people are usually of happy disposition, are they not, death and taxes not withstanding.

  

Is Valerio happy - with our answers that is...

  

Regards,
