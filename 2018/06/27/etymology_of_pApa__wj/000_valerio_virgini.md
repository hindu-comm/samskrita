Dear scholars

  

the word पाप is generally translated as "sin", but I suspect that this term expresses a Judaic concept that does not belong to the Vedic tradition.

  

So I tried to go back to his etymology. But I could not find anything.

  

For the moment I can only make a guess, but I am not skilled enough in Sanskrit, and for this reason I appeal to this group.

  

I think that पाप derives from the root पत् + affixed प of the causative.

For some euphonical reason the त्disappears, and the प becomes पा. Perhaps because in the metric of patpa the प is गुरु.

Di conseguenza, पाप è un'azione che provoca una caduta.  

  

Apart from this fantasy of mine, is there anyone who can seriously explain the etymology of this word?

  

thank you

valerio
