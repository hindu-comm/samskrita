Nagaraj said;

  

paapa(h) in 'Hinduism' has its roots in and/or connections with the Vedic /meemaamsaa concept of pratyavaaya(h).  

  

  

This is also my idea of pāpam, that is, something that puts man in a less elevated position ... (pat, fall), in which he does not enjoy the protection (paa) of "isvara", due to the fact that one "drank (pā) what was not to be drunk".

  

I find all this consistent and ... beautiful.

  

thank you all!
