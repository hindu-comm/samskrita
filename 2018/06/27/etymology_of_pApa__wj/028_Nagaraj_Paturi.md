Nowadays I am getting the mails of this list as digest as I changed my settings recently towards that.

  

This important discussion missed my attention. I just went through the thread.

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

More important than the etymology of the word paapah is the validity of the translation of the word 'paapa(h) as sin.

  

Sri Valerio-ji's hunch that the word 'sin' (is Christian and) has its Judo-Christian connotations is valid.

  

paapah is not to be translated as 'sin'.

  

This has been one of numerous wrong translations that crept into English writings on Hinduism and English translations of Hindu/Vedic/Sanskrit works.

  

It may be noted that strongest objections to such translations/usages come from the Christian sources/websites only because they believe that their concept of, say, for example, 'God' is unique, absolutely different from concepts from other 'religions'.

  

paapa(h) in 'Hinduism' has its roots in and/or connections with the Vedic /meemaamsaa concept of pratyavaaya(h).

  

Sri Valerio-ji says

  

"but I am interested in the meaning expressed in thebhagavadgītā(and probably in all themahābhārata )"

  

paapah is that

  

1\. which is accrued due to the performance of paapakarma

  

2\. which is accrued due to the non-performance of ordained nityakarma

  

3\. which is accrued due to the violation of svadharma

  

4\. which is carried by the jeeva aatman +sookshmas'areera as part of linga/kaaraNa s'areera in the travel of the jeeva in the form of sookshmas'areera after leaving the sthoolas'areera

  

5\. the phala of which leads to naraka (which is not hell) which does not stop the jeeva from taking birth again

  

6\. the phala of which leads to punarjanma of a certain kind or certain experiences in punarjanma

  

7\. the phala of which, unlike the phala of puNya , can not be rejected by the jeeva

  

8\. the phala of which can be destroyed through various paapavinaas'aka karmas or through s'araNaagati/prapatti.

  

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

"7. the phala of which, unlike the phala of puNya , can not be rejected by the jeeva"

  

is important for Bhagavadgeetaa because 'karmaphalasnnyaasayoga' one of the major paths recommended by Bhagavadgeetaa constitutes attaining moksha by rejecting the phala of karmas; puNyakarmaphala can be rejected but not the phala of paapakarmas ; hence the way left is to perform puNyakarmas and reject their phala and get the phala of paapa karmas of the past destroyed.

  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Since this framework of paapa within the jananamaraNa chakra caused by karmaphala does not exist for 'sin' , it is a wrong translation of paapa.
