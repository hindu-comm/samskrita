Notes

Mini-Encyclopedia on Om

Available in both Hindi and English versions

Beautifully printed and bound

  

The Om Mala is a book written on just one word – Om. Om is one of the shortest Sanskrit words, and yet it is among the powerful words in the lexicon. Om is a globally recognised mystic mantra, venerated and worshipped by all four Indian origin religions – Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It is chanted by spiritual seekers and yogic practitioners alike. Contemplative saints focus their awareness on the Om and attain miraculous insights into the true self.

  

This book gives 84 names of Om, cited from Sanskrit texts. Each name is explained in depth. The author defines the term, gives it etymological roots, describes the the tradition or the story behind the term. The emphasis is on giving the reader an accurate and deep understanding of the term, concomitant teachings and their teleological purpose. Despite it evidently scholarly content, the book has been written with a light touch and remains reader friendly throughout.   
  
The book cites narratives sourced from all genres of Sanskrit writing: The Vedas, the Upanishads, the Smritis, the Puranas, the Epics, and the most prominent texts from all six schools of thought. Pearls from Yoga, Tantra and Ayurveda traditions have found expression here. The importance of Om in the dhyana marga and its relevance to Jain, Buddhist and Sikh religions is explained briefly.   
  
Fortunately, author Nityananda Misra is equally fluent in Hindi and English and hence this book is available in both languages.   
  
We are proud to make this beautifully printed mini-encyclopaedia on Om available at our bookstore and through mail order. We ship books in India and internationally.
