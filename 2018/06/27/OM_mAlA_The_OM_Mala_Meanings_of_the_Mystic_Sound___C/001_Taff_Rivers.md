As a practitioner with no commercial interest in these books.

And speaking as one with personal experience of a successful outcome.

  

I can *recommend* a book that explains ***how to*** harness the power of this ***manas*** of ours.

How to realise that state of 'pure consciousness or ***\*sakti***.

  

It is **Om Chanting & Meditation\****,* by Dr. Amit Ray. PhD

  

I quote:

  

 This book is a step-by-step guide ***to practise meditations*** with the Om.

 As you practise, a long-lasting sense of well-being manifests in your life.

 You will notice a sense of joyfulness entering your life along with an ability to appreciate the many gifts that surround you.

 This book will help both the beginners as well as the advanced ***practitioners***.

  

End quote.

*\* sakti* as described by the YS.

Thatentire work is a treatise on this universal*sakti*of ours.

It *begins with it*by telling what the book is all about - it's about 'that which sees' ***drastuh***- about that which powers the inner instrument ***manas.***

It *ends*with it, by telling that us what it is the powers***drastuh***-***sakti.***
