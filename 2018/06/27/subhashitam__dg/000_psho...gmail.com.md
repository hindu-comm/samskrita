Now that we're talking about a word and its meaning, a fun subhashitam. No offense to anyone.

  

शब्दार्थरसवेलायं शब्दोत्पत्तिं वदन्ति ये

नीविविस्रंसवेलायां मूल्यं पृच्छन्ति वाससः

  

śabdārtharasavelāyaṃ śabdotpattiṃ vadanti ye  
nīvivisraṃsavelāyāṃ mūlyaṃ pṛcchanti vāsasaḥ

  

Meaning: While others are savoring the meaning of a word, there are some who want to speak of its origin. These are the same people who, when a skirt comes off a woman's waist, ask the price of the cloth it's made of.

  

P.S. I tried to come up with a literal translation but this is the best I could do. I'm sure you guys can improve it.
