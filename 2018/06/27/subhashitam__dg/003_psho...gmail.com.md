This subhashitam is from Manusmriti (मनुस्मृतिः), composed by Manu.

  

Of course, such a wife is a fantasy come true! :-)  

  

Now, whether it's a subhashitam:

  

Wikipedia for subhashita (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita>) quotesLudwik Sternbach(under the section labeled 'structure'):

  

...such form of Indian literature had a tinge of poetry, the poetical skill being exhibited in the intricate play of words which created a slight wit, humour, satire and sententious precepts; they arose (sic) laughter, scorn, compass (sic) and other moods...  

  

As noted by Sternbach, a subhashitam is allowed to arouse scorn in its readers/listeners.

  

So there you go! You're fully justified in feeling scorn.
