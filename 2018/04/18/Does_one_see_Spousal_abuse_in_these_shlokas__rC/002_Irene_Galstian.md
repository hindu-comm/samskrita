Irrespective of who has given themselves unto whom, or how hard the feminists work, it's well to remind ourselves that we are free do act however we wish, as long as we are also ready to accept the consequences of our actions, by whichever route they catch up with us. And catch up they will - that's a fairly reliable pattern in life.
