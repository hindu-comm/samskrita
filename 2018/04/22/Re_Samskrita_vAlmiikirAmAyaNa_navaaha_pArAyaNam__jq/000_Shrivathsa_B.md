Please always use a subject line for your message.

  

If you are comfortable reading hindi, the giitaa press edition containing only muula has a procedure.

  

If you know kannaDa,

1\. the 8 volume translation into kannaDa by late vid. Ranganatha Sharma has the procedures as per various traditions.

2\. Same with the translation produced by Bharata Darshana.

  

If you know samskRRitam, there is a procedure described in rAmabhaktikalpalatA.
