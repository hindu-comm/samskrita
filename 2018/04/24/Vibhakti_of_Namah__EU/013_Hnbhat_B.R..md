They both are wrong to some extent like you.

  

Dictionary doesn't contain many words used in grammar or grammatically derived words. You have rely on grammar or works like Shabdamanjari for beginners based on grammar. As for Abhyankar, he has not seen the pronoun. It is included in Sarvadigana in  

सर्वादीनि सर्वनामानि१५१, १।१।२६

सर्व विश्व उभ उभय डतर डतम अन्य अन्यतर इतर त्वत् त्व नेम सम सिम। पूर्वपरावरदक्षिणोत्तरापराधराणि व्यवस्थायामसंज्ञायाम्। स्वमज्ञातिधनाख्यायाम्। अन्तरं बहिर्योगोपसंव्यानयोः। त्यद् तद् यद् एतद् इदम् अदस् एक द्वि युष्मद् अस्मद् भवतु किम्॥

Please read explanation of Sarvadi given in the Sutra till you find the pronounत्वत् and see yourself that the pronoun is included by Panini himself. I think you might not have heard the name of Panini the Sanskrit Grammarian who wrote Ashtadhyayi from which I have given the pronoun list and not from Dictionary or any Sanskrit Teacher's book.
