Dear Sanskrit lovers,

  

Users of online tools should learn how to use them before claiming they are faulty.

It is expressly indicated in the online manual of the Sanskrit Heritage site:

If you enter random stems and parameters, you will get arbitrary nonsense, according to the principle "garbage-in garbage-out".  

  

In the case of the discussed rootदिव् (to shine), it is actually listed in the Heritage dictionary as diiv#1, as shown [here](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/32.html#diiv%231). If you press the red 4 indicating its [ga.na](http://ga.na), you will get the intended conjugation tables.

If instead you use the associated online Monier-Williams, it is listed as \[div\]2, as shown [here](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/117.html#divf2).If you press the red 4 indicating its [ga.na](http://ga.na), you will get the same conjugation tables, because the software knows that MW\[div\]2 aligns with Heritage diiv#1.

But if you use directly the conjugation service, you must know that its correct parameters are diiv/दीव् for the stem and 4 for the present class. The system infers that this must be rootdiiv#1, and delivers the right tables.

  

Names of roots vary across dictionaries/dhaatupaa.thas. In particular,dhaatupaa.thas may list roots with their accompanying anubandhas (derivational parameters), which must be removed in order to get the stem (अङ्गम्) of the root. Thus root hve may be found in Western grammars as hve, hvaa or huu.

  

Of course, online software always contain residual mistakes. Signaling them will help improving the tools

Best regards
