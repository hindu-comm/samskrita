It is not any*āgama for Sanaskrit Grammar,* but only Ashtadhyayi for grammar trustworthy. There is no question about it.

WE find no objection usiing Ashtadhyayi. As a beginner, he can use Shabdamanjari list of declensionary as we had learnt. I have no objection as it is perfect for a beginner, Problem he has arised not as beginner, but exploring multiple sources. Instead if he had asked the question, he would have got reply as Ramesh has given in his message and I have explained in my message.
