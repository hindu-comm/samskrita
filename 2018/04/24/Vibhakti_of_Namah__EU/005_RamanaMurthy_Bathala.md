Respected Scholars,

  

I have been using the online tools for declension and conjugation.

  

There is question of reliability on them. Some websites give correct forms and some give incorrect forms. As a student, it is difficult to find which one is correct. Let me bring once instance.

I have been trying for the conjugation of the root दिव् (to shine)

  

1) From Text Book

2) From the website: <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/grammar.html>

It is better to check at multiple sources.
