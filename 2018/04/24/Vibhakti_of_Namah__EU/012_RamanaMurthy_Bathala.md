Dear Sir,

  

My problem: Should I accept त्वत् as a declinable प्रातिपदिकम् of a pronoun?

Some scholars are not accepting the word त्वत् as pronoun (प्रातिपदिकम्). Hence they say it cannot be declined. Because it is already in the declined form. So cascading of the declension is not allowed. When input is processed, we get output. Now we are giving this output as input for another process. How many times this cascading is allowed?

1)

Long back I contacted the author of the book. [Sanskrit Teacher for English Speaking People](https://www.amazon.in/Sanskrit-Teacher-English-Speaking-People/dp/8173154813?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=04204d8a-f57f-4042-a3c1-c8d59f919cdc) . Here is the response:



Dear Shri Ramana murthy ji,

Thanks for your email. You can not find the declension for त्वत् because त्वत् is not a dictionary word. The declension tables you prepared are arbitrary. त्वत् itself is the Ablative Singular (m. f. n.) declension of the pronoun युष्मद् (त्वत्, युवाभ्याम्, युष्मत्). You can not decline already declined word.

Keep up the good work.

Next, almost the opinion is expressed by Sri S. L. Abhyankar

Here is the response I received in my mail.

नमस्ते श्रीमन् रमणमूर्ति-महोदय !

I am surprised that शब्दमञ्जिरी mentions त्वत् as a declinable प्रातिपदिकम् \|

It is simply पञ्चमी एकवचनम् of युष्मद्-सर्वनाम ! प्रातिपदिकम् is युष्मद् !

It is also used in compound words as उपपदम् standing for त्वम्. It has to be the पूर्वपदम् of the compound word -

See त्वदन्यः संशयस्यास्य छेत्ता न ह्युपपद्यते (गीता 6'39) त्वत्तः (or त्वत्) अन्यः = त्वदन्यः

Also न त्वत्समोऽस्त्यभ्यधिकः कुतोऽन्यो (गीता 11'43) त्वया समः = त्वत्समः

Cordially, S. L. Abhyankar

सस्नेहम्,
