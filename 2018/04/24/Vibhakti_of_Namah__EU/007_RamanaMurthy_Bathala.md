Respected Hnbhat Sir,

Thanks for reply.

  

I request you to clarify the below doubt from Sabda Manjari text book which is standard book for Sanskrit beginners.

  

1) त्वत् *tvat* (Other) is given as one of the 35 pronouns in Sabda Manjari.

2) But in the same Sabda Manjari book, same word त्वत् *tvat* is given as the Ablative Singular of the pronoun युष्मद् *yuṣmad*.

Now the question is: can the same word (त्वत् *tvat*) be the pronoun and the declined form of another pronoun? Doesn’t it look like absurd?

  

  

3) Now considering the त्वत् *tvat* as pronoun, Sabda Manjari gives how to decline it. Here is the screen shot.[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_xlH2UR7J5c/Wubc2iMFOeI/AAAAAAAACRU/l5iuvVPpxno2FHk7HZb4CT4Gh-Uz_9LKACLcBGAs/s1600/3.jpg)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_xlH2UR7J5c/Wubc2iMFOeI/AAAAAAAACRU/l5iuvVPpxno2FHk7HZb4CT4Gh-Uz_9LKACLcBGAs/s1600/3.jpg)[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wpggv5cJzTA/Wubc9poRA3I/AAAAAAAACRY/Vo-UdMvugWMLJm1RW_oIeuP_r1Uix45fACLcBGAs/s1600/4.jpg)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wpggv5cJzTA/Wubc9poRA3I/AAAAAAAACRY/Vo-UdMvugWMLJm1RW_oIeuP_r1Uix45fACLcBGAs/s1600/4.jpg)

4) त्वत् *tvat* given as the pronoun in “A Higher Sanskrit Grammar” by MR KALE. Here is the screen shot.
