Professor,

  

 Surely, a person is in a better position to decide on a course of action when he has enough information to make up his own mind.

It is necessary to be in possesion of an Author/Authorities works, to best judge his/its worth.

  

I rest my case. And reserve the right to make up my own mind (:-).

  

 Regards,
