Professor,

  
  
 "It is better to a single reliable book or source than multiple sources as you cannot decide the correct form yourself."

  

Indeed, but how does one determine whether a given *ƒÅgama* is trustworthy?

  

There is no known way of doing so with absolute certainty.

The recognised best way is *by consensus* of those that know those things.

  

However, when it comes to Sanskrit, there is no majority opinion to go by, so we have to decide for ourselves.

  

Millenia go by and grammarians are still battling to establish their version as the standard one.

  

The 'form' that people actually rely on is the one that works in terms of human communication of information as a basis for action.  

  

Even if it be formal i.e. proper grammar, what constitutes formal depends on the writer/speaker.

  

A *nanu* (objection),
