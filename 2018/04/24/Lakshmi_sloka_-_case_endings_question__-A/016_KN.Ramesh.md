BTW,Shangkha-Cakra-Gadaa-Haste refers to which Lakshmi - Going by the end line - Iti indrakruta Mahalakshmi ashtakam stotram sampoornam - Probably mahalakshmi - but I am unable to find an image of Mahalakshmi with gadaa in hands including the ashtalakshmis.  

Or is Indra referring to the Chandikaa Mahalakshmi occurring in madhyama charitram of durga saptasati..?

Or is she the bhargavi ?

Can we consider Bhargavi & Lakshmi as one and the same?

  

also the vahana for Lakshmi is owl
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lakshmi_02349.JPG>)and called as Ulkavahini here:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vahana>

I feel ulookavahini could be more right word. Am I right?

  

Slightly out of the subject,Shangkha-Cakra-Gadaa-Haste - suits to Guruvayoorappan too. He also carries the padmam in his 4th hand.

Probably is he the masculine form of Goddess Lakshmi... going by the similarity of the objects they carry??
