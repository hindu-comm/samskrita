श्रीमन् भट-महोदय !

  

I am not making any change in reading, *please*. I am keeping शङ्ख-चक्र-गदा-हस्तेwith no change therein. I am just deciphering the compound word.

  

Deciphering of a compound word, especially when there are more than two components would progress by different समासप्रकार-s.

-   Here the components शङ्ख-चक्र-गदा are deciphered together by the
    इतरेतर-द्वंद्व-विग्रहः. And the deciphering does not
    flauntपरवल्लिङ्गं द्वन्द्वतत्पुरुषयोः Theपर-component isगदा
    feminine. The deciphering शङ्ख-चक्र-गदाः employs feminine plural
    only. No flaunting ofपरवल्लिङ्गं. It is plural, because it
    isइतरेतर-द्वंद्व-विग्रहः.  
-   Next, शङ्ख-चक्र-गदा-हस्ता by बहुव्रीहि-विग्रहः, which is essentially
    adjectival, that is why it is अन्यपदप्रधान. Theअन्यपद is the
    विशेष्य. Being adjectival, it needs to conform to यल्लिङ्गं यद्वचनम्
    Here theविशेष्य is Devi, which is feminine andशङ्ख-चक्र-गदा-हस्ता
    is feminine. -   I wish to confirm that everything of the deciphering is in perfect
    conformance.

I am left wondering how thisशङ्ख-चक्र-गदा-हस्ता connects with the constellationहस्ता(?!)
