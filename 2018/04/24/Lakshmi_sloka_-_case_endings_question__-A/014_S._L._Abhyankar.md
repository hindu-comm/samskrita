नमस्ते श्रीमन् अरविन्द-कोल्हटकर-वर्य !

  

As pointed out by Dr. Bhat, quoting from the dictionary, the name of the constellation is seen used both masculine हस्त or feminine हस्ता.

  

Anyway, हस्तor हस्ता as a constellation does not seem to have any relevance with the other component words in the total compound word शङ्ख-चक्र-गदा-हस्ते (संबोधन-विभक्ति of शङ्ख-चक्र-गदा-हस्ता).
