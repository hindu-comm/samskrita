Dear Arvind  

Your translation does say "in the hand" (see below in your post)  
  

I do not think that this is a बहुव्रीहि समास .  

Rather, शङ्खचक्रगदा forms a द्वन्द्व समास.  

That is compound with हस्त (or हस्ता see below)  

The bahuvrihi is usually a compound where the object is neither of the words.  

The dvandva is like a list, in this case what she holds in her hands...  

If the translation says "in the hand" it is because the case ending of the final word in the samaasa.  

  
I did check the dictionary, and hasta can be female hastaa, but both the masculine and feminine are given as nouns, not adjectives.  

So I can see how the entire समास would be female adjective.  

Perhaps this is a traditional usage which I confess I am not used to - could someone point to a correction?  
  

Kind Regards  

Ryan
