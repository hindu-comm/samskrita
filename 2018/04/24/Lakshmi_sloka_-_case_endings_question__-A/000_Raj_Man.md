Namastey,

  

In following sloka, can someone elaborate on the case endings of "MaayE", "pujitE", "hastEy", "namostutEy". They all end in "yE" kaara.
Is that fourth vibhakti? I am unable to relate to the root of these terms.

Also is the word "namstEstu" conjugation of NamastEy+astu ?

  

  

Namastestu Mahaa-Maaye Shrii-Piitthe Sura-Puujite \|  
Shangkha-Cakra-Gadaa-Haste Mahaalakssmi Namostute  

  

  

thanks
