Ryan,

  

Namastestu Mahaa-Maaye Shrii-Piitthe Sura-Puujite \|

Shangkha-Cakra-Gadaa-Haste Mahaalakssmi Namostute

  

नमस्तेऽस्तु महामाये श्रीपीठे सुरपूजिते ।

शङ्खचक्रगदाहस्ते महालक्ष्मि नमोऽस्तु ते ॥

  

According to you, in शङ्खचक्रगदाहस्ते , "Haste is in the 7th form - it is masculine ending in a. The translation is "in the hand". By that you are saying that 'Haste' is the locative case of Hastaहस्त.

  

That would indeed be so ifहस्त were a stand-alone word. But here it is not so.शङ्खचक्रगदाहस्ता is a बहुव्रीहि समास qualifying महालक्ष्मी and is resolved as शङ्ख: चक्रं गदा (च) हस्ते यस्या:.

  

The verse is translated thus:

  

Salute be to you - O Mahalakshmi, Goddess of great divine power, of auspicious seat, the one worshiped by divines, the one who has in the hand the conch-shell, the wheel and the mace. Salute be to you.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
