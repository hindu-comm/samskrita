"परवल्लिङ्गं द्वन्द्वतत्पुरुषययोः" makes गदा at the end in feminine plural and in bahuvrihi it will be according to the noun qualifying noun, here mahalakshmi in feminine in vocative singular. अन्यपदार्थप्रधानो बहुव्रीहिः।

  

Not because hasta is in masculine and plural in dictionary. Hastaa in feminine does not mean hand, but name of a star among 27 starss constellation.

  

It is from Padmapurana and no need of thinking to change the reading!
