नमस्ते Raj Man ji  

These are not all the same ending.  

maaye is, as sri Arvind says the vocative ending for female nouns ending in aa.  

The vocative is the form of direct address, so in English it would be O! Maya.  

Similarly, puujite = O! honoured one.  
  

Haste is in the 7th form - it is masculine ending in a.  

The translation is "in the hand"  
  

namostute is actually a few words in sandhi. The transliteration you are using is not familiar to me, so I am assuming that this is:  
नमोऽस्तुते  

which is  
नमः अस्तु ते  

Here, the te means "you" (or actually 5th form "to you")  

literally  

obeisance may it be to you  
  

If you could post the devanagari and a reference to where the verse is from, a better explanation may be given.  
  

Yours in Truth  

Ryan
