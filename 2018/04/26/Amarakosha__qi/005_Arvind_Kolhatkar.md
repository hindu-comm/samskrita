I have uploaded [here](https://ia601509.us.archive.org/35/items/AmarakoshaWithCommentaryByMaheshwaraIndex394/Amarakosha%20with%20commentary%20by%20Maheshwara%20Index%20394.pdf)a .pdf copy of 'Amarakosha with Commentary by Maheshwara' published by the Department of Public Instruction, Bombay in 1896. This book has an alphabetical index of all words from Amarakosha and is thus very useful to those who want to locate a given word in Amarakosha.
