Attached is a glossary of words in Amarakosha, prepared by me for my use from something that I had come across on the internet. I cannot now recollect the source. The glossary is in the .rtf format and I use the Baraha Pad to open it. Any word that you wish to locate should be found in the glossary through edit-find. TheKaanDa / Varga / Shloka number is noted next to the word.
