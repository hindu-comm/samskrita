Respected Prof. Dr.Amba Madam,

  

Thanks for the treasure. Very very useful.

The 2nd ink (<http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/amarakosha/frame.html>) is still giving problem when directly clicked.

However if I click knowledge-net of amarakosha with hyperlink it redirects to<http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/amarakosha/frame.html>and then it is working..

  

Anyway both the links take you to the same source..

  

<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/amarakosha.pdf>- This link seems to be not working...

In case if it is copyrighted, kindly mail it to me privately.

  

Is there a good Tamil to sanskrit dictionary BTW?  

  

namaskarams
