For mote on गणेश दैवज्ञ you will have to consult SB Dixit'sभारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्र in Marathi. Unfortunately, this book, first published in 1896, has been out of print for long and a digital copy is not available, as far as I know. I have a print copy brought out by Varada Prakashan of Pune in 1989 but that publisher too has closed down quite some time ago.

  

A two-part abridged English translation of this book by Prof RV Vaidya and published by the National Astronomy Centre, New Delhi, is available at
