It is no Rama who wonders seeing Lava and Kusha, but Dushyanta, seeing Bharata playing with lion who says the verse :

आलक्ष्यदन्तमुकुलाननिमित्तहसै- रव्यक्तवर्णरमणियवचःप्रवृत्तीन् ।  
अङ्काश्रयप्रणयिनस्तनयान्वहन्तो धन्यास्तदङ्गरजसामलिनीभवन्ति  
(शाकुन्तल ७.१७)

Hello,

I have been looking for a verse in Sanskrit which I had come across 65 years ago and have been unable to find it to date.

I shall be extremely grateful if any of the Sanskrit enthusiasts in google groups can help me please.

  

Unfortunately I am unable to quote the exact source but I can give the description of the situation mentioned in the verse. I can remember a few lines of the verse but not in proper order. The complete verse is comprised of four lines if I remember correctly.

  

The occasion is Ram returning from his वनवास comes across an आश्रम where he sees लव and कुश playing with a lion's cubs. He is unaware that they are his own sons. He admires them and (the poet) says---

  

"Having seen the tiny teeth when the two children laugh (smile) without any reason.

  

आलक्ष्य दंत मुकुलान अनिमित्त हासै:ही That is the one line I remember and the second one is as follows:-

  

"Blessed are those who are soiled by the dust(dirt) from their (own children's) bodies.

  

धन्यस् तदंग रजसा मलिनी भवंति

  

Ram wonders how the parents of these little children are blessed to have such beautiful children who smile without any reason exposing their tiny teeth (no ulterior motive for their smiles, totally innocent).

  

The children are rolling in the dirt with the lion cubs, Ram wonders how blessed must be the parents of these children who will be soiled by the dust when they (the parents) embrace them affectionately.

  

While Ram is lost in these thoughts he is totally unaware that those two adorable boys are his own.

  

Thank you very much.

  

Ramesh Telang
