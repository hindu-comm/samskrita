Namaste Abhyankarji,  
  
The following two verses are from your Sanskrit blog:  
  
(1)  
यल्लिंगं यद्वचनं या च विभक्तिर्विशेषस्य ।  
तल्लिंगं तद्वचनं सैव विभक्तिर्विशेषणस्यापि ॥  
(2)  
लट् वर्तमाने लोट् वेदे भूते लुङ् लङ् लिटस्तथा ।  
विध्याशिषौ लिङ्लोटौ लुट् लृट् लृङ् च भविष्यतः ॥  
  
My translation of (1)  
As are the gender, number and case of the subject, so should be the gender, number and case of its adjective too.  
  
Verse (2), it is clear, is about tenses and moods of verbs. But its translation I am incapable of. Can you please help me with its translation?  
  
Many thanks and regards,  
Venkat
