I know that the following is out of focus for the thread here but let me mention it all the same.

  

I have a digital copy of Simhasana Battishi in Marathi, printed at the Serampore Press in 1814. It carries a note 'वैजनाथ शर्मणा क्रियते. It is known that Vaijanatha Sharma was a Marathi Brahmin who worked closely with Rev William Carey. The book is printed not in Devanagari but in the Modi script which was more in use in those days for writing Marathi. The book also carries a stamp with the writing on it 'किताब कालिज फोर्टवलियम.
