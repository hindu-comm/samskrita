Ken,

  

What you have given is indeed very helpful.

  

[Mahamahopadhyaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamahopadhyaya "Mahamahopadhyaya")[PV Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandurang_Vaman_Kane) was awarded 'Bharatratna' the highest civil award by the Government of India for his scholarship and for his monumental work 'History of Dharmashastra' .

  

What you have made available is a summary of Vol II Part 1. The full 'History of Dharmashastra' comprises of the following parts:

  

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 1

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 2.1

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 2.2

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 3

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 4

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 5.1

History of Dharmashastra PV Kane Vol 5.2

  

Can you revisit the webpage where you found Vol II Part 1 and also look for similar summaries of the remaining parts?

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
