Ken,

  

I have all these volumes downloaded from [archive.org](http://archive.org) and the DLI. However, they are very bulky files and difficult to handle. The link to Vol II Part I that you have provided is 'formatted for ebooks' as mentioned therein and is quick to download and easy to handle. I was looking for similarly formatted ebooks for the remaining parts, if they are available.
