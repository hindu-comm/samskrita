Sir,

Though the Original message was deleted, your reply still exists on the group posts and I accessed it by chance, the post still contains original links.

Out of curiosity I clicked and even today on May 5, 2018,I could down load both these pdf. I hope someone is more vigilant and will deleteall links permanently.

I already had purchasedprinted copies of both these books somy intention was not of cheating SB from its revenue, but just to caution. I have deleted the links from Mr. Ramesh in my response.

Thanks and Regards,

Paresh Dalal
