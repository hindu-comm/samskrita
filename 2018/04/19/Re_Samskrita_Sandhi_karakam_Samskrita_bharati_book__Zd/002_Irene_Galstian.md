I agree. But I'd like to tell you also of the multiple times multiple people tried to get physical books from SB and couldn't. They were messed about, asked to go to this and that warehouse, but most often simply ignored. The SB staff in charge of book sales are unhelpful and negligent. Just seeing many books and DVDs on their site means nothing: try getting them, and they are never in stock. Email SB, and you never get a reply.

Small wonder that when something is finally obtained, it's scanned and shared. SB staff aren't doing their job, but the public does need the books.

You see, things never happen without a reason.
