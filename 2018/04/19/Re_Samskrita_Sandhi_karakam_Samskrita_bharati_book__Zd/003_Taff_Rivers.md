Irene, et al,

  

 The Samskrita Bharati Indian site is indeed somewhat neglected.

  

As for taking the law into your own hands, ignorance is no excuse.

The books are indeed readily available.

They are in print, and copyrighted, as anyone can see for themselves.

  

View the BharatiUSA HQ site:

  <http://www.samskritabharatiusa.org/>

  

and its bookstore:

 
<https://secure.samskritabharatiusa.org/np/clients/sb594/giftstore.jsp>

  

Regards,

 Taff \_Rivers
