The given below poetic lines are seems to be absurd.But it's real meaning is:

  

यायायायायायायायायायायाया।

यायायायायायायायायायायाया।।

This process of breaking these shlokam into proper words is called "NAVAHA"

  

The proper words are:

यायाया, आय, यायाया, आय,आयाय, अयाय, अयाय ,अयाय, अयाय  
अयाय,अयाया, यायाय, आयायाय, आयाय,या, या,या,या,या,या,या,या  

  

And when you break it up properly the verse then reveals the meaning:  

  

Meaning:

The sandals that adorn the Lord, which help in the attainment of all that is good, which gives knowledge, which causes the desire to attain the Lord, which removes all that is hostile, which attain the lord and are used to travel aound by which all the places can be reached - these sandals are for Lord Vishnu.
