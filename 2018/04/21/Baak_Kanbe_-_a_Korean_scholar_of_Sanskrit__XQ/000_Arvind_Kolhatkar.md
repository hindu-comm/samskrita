Can any member in this learned Group help me find information about a Korean scholar of Sanskrit, by name Baak Kanbe (बाक कन्बे)? His Sanskrit commentary on अमरुशतक, called अमरुशतकलीला, was brought out by the Bharatavani Prakashan of Poona (Pune) in 1967. In the introduction of this book is a mention of another book by the same author, called 'मेघदूतविलास’ which is a Sanskrit commentary on मेघदूत. No other information about him could be gleaned through a Google search.

  

अमरुशतकलीला is available at DLI/[archive.org](http://archive.org).
