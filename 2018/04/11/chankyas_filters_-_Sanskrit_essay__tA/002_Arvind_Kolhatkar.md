Please notice thatतितउ is (perhaps) theonly Sanskrit word that terminates in a stand-alone vowel. At least I am not aware of any other.

  

As to sourcing the story to other thinkers and philosophers, it is well-known that the ascription of many aphorisms, stories, canons of good behavior etc to चाणक्य, वृद्धवाणक्य, गार्ग्य, व्यास and several other equally well-known names is a matter of unknown and unvarifiable tradition only.
