Arvind,

  

 I am challenged here, not an unusual situation for me when it comes to Sanskrit, but having looked around, I undertstand that तितउis a sung *sound.*

**And not a wordin the lexicon sense.

  

Your तितउ contains a double udatta between the तित and the उ. Normally indicated in Vedic lipi by the small numeral 2.

  

As for तितउbeing an akṣarā (a word), I am in doubt...

  

Perhaps the source of our confusion lies in the तितउना in Ramesh's post and its mixing of lipi (scripts) standards.

It is misleading as it has that (hidden) double udatta. And again, those double quotes, those question marks... they don't transliterate!

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
