Namaste Dear Subramanian ji

  

I do not reside in Chennai (or even in Bharata Desha), however, I did post your request to another mailing list I am part of which has members all over India.

Here are the responses I received:

1\.

Two well known centers for learning Sanksrit inChennaiare GGSS and Samskrita Bharati (links below)

  

<http://www.ggss.org.in/Branches-Nanganallur.html>

<https://samskritabharati.in/contact>

  

GGSS is in Nanganallur and Teynampet. Nanganallur is about 8 kms closer to Tambaram area compared to Teynampet,

  

Samskrita Bharati conduct workshops in different parts of the city from time to time. Might be a good idea to reach out to them directly to check if they are conducting classes in the area. I will also do the same.

  

Aside from these 2, I have heard Ramakrishna Mutt in Mylapore,Chennaialso teachSanskrit. I'm not sure if these are regular classes or if this is on a personal basis. I will find out more and keep you posted.

  

I will also enquire if there are any tutors/centers that teachSanskritin the Tambaram area.

  

2\.

If I were you, I would contact Madam Smt.Saroja Ramanujam - I do not have her email but she can be found in facebook - you have to send a message to her - she is currently teaching online - You can give myreference (as Acharya Sadananda) if it helps.  

  

  

The second response seems to be online rather than in Chennai.

If I receive any more feedback, I'll post it here.

I hope this helps - good luck with your ongoing studies!

  

Regards

Ryan
