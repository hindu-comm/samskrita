***STOTRAM ON PUJYA SRI JAYENDRA SARASWATHI SWAMIJI***

***BY PUJYA SRI SANKARA VIJAYENDRA SARASWATHI SWAMIJI***

  

Translation by P. R. Kannan

  

भजेऽहं भगवत्पादं भारतीयशिखामणिम् । अद्वैतमैत्रीसद्भावचेतनायाः प्रबोधकम् ॥१॥

**I adore Sri Adi Sankara Bhagavatpada, the crest-jewel of Bharatiyas; who awakened the feeling of friendship and goodwill stemming from Advaita (non-duality). (1)**

  

अष्टषष्टितमाचार्यं वन्दे शङ्कररूपिणम् । चन्द्रशेखरयोगीन्द्रं योगलिङ्गप्रपूजकम् ॥२॥

**I pay obeisance to Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi, the 68**^(**th**) **Acharya, the very form of Siva, the lord among Yogis; who worshipped Yogalinga.**

**(Yogalinga is one of the five Sphaika lingas brought by Adi Sankaracharya from Kailasa and established by him in Kanchi Kamakoti Srimatham). (2)**

  

वरेण्यं वरदं शान्तं वदान्यं चन्द्रशेखरम् । वाग्मिनं वाग्यतं वन्द्यं विशिष्टाचारपालकम् ॥३॥

**I worship Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi, who is supreme, boon-giver, tranquil, munificent, eloquent and at the same time restrained in speech, worthy of worship, excellent protector of good conduct norms. (3)**

  

देवे देहे च देशे च भक्त्यारोग्यसुखप्रदम्। बुधपामरसेव्यं तं श्रीजयेन्द्रं नमाम्यहम् ॥४॥

**I worship Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, who is the bestower of devotion to Iswara, good health and comfort in the country; and who is adored by all people from the wise to the dull-witted. (4)**

  

वृत्तवृत्तिप्रवृत्तीनां कारणं करणं प्रभुम् । गुरुं नौमि नताशेषनन्दनं नयकोविदम् ॥ ५ ॥

**I worship my Guru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, who is the maker of history, moulder of conduct (or profession), lord of destiny (or attitude); who delights everyone who prostrates; and who is prudent in policymaking. (5)**

प्रजाविचारधर्मेषु नेतारं निपुणं निधिम् । वन्देऽहं शङ्कराचार्यं श्रीजयेन्द्रसरस्वतीम् ॥ ६ ॥

**I worship Sankaracharya Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, who leads and guides all people, who is master of thoughtful enquiry, and who is treasure of Dharma. (6)**

  

सितासितसरिद्रत्नमज्जनं मन्त्रवित्तमम् । दानचिन्तामणिं नौमि निश्चिन्तं नीतिकोकिलम् ॥७ ॥

**I worship Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, who bathes in the white and blue coloured jewels among rivers, Ganga and Yamuna; who is the best among knowers of mantras; who is verily Chintamani (gem which yields all desired objects) in charity; who is free from thought (or anxiety); who is the cuckoo spreading ethics. (7)**

  

सरस्वतीगर्भरत्नं सुवर्णं साहसप्रियम् । लक्ष्मीवत्सं लोलहासं नौमि तं दीनवत्सलम् ॥ ८ ॥

**I worship Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, the jewel from the womb of Saraswathi; golden in fame; who likes quick action; who is the child of Lakshmi; whose smile is enchanting; who is kind to the poor. (8)**

**Saraswathi is the name of Sri Acharya’s mother; but he is also the child of Lakshmi in that his magical touch turns everything into gold.**

  

गतिं भारतदेशस्य मतिं भारतजीविनाम्। वन्दे यतिं साधकानां पतिमद्वैतदर्शिनाम् ॥९॥

**I worship Yati Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, the destination of Bharatadesa, the intellect of those living in Bharatadesa; the master of aspirants eager to realise Advaita.**

  

इति श्रीशङ्करविजयेन्द्रसरस्वतीशङ्कराचार्यस्वामिभिः विरचिता श्री जयेन्द्रसरस्वती श्लोकमालिका**.**

**Thus ends the garland of verses on Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Swamiji, composed by Sankaracharya Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswathi Swamiji.**

  

**ॐ तत् सत्**
