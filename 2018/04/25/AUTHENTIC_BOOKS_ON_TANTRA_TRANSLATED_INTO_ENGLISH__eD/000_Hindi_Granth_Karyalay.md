AUTHENTIC BOOKS ON TANTRA TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH  
  
<http://www.navelgazing.net/2018/04/authentic-books-on-tantra-translated.html>

  

Liberation is the goal of every religion. India has given birth to several religions and hence has given the world different paths to walk on, in order to attain their spiritual goals.

  

Paths like jnana {knowledge}, dhyana {meditation}, bhakti {devotion}, prema {love}, yoga {awareness}, karmakanda {rituals}, sadhana {disciplined practise}, samyama {self-control}, tapa {penance} and tantra {mysticism} have flourished in the ecumenical culture of Ancient India.   
  
Of all these paths, yoga and tantra are the best known and perhaps the least understood.

  

There are some excellent Sanskrit texts that shed light on these esoteric topics. But a lack of samyak understanding of these texts, shortage of sound scholarship and an unawareness of the experiential aspect of tantra has rendered most translations redundant.   
  
Here is a series of authentic Sanskrit texts, along with an expert English translation.
