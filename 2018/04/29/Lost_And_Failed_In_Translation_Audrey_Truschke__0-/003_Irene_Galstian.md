I find the current state of affairs in India deeply saddening.

Ranganayakamma is a Marxist feminist. It would be remarkable indeed if someone with such views possessed the capacity to appreciate Rama. But it's not surprising that this author saw Ramayana as the poison tree.Isn't there any worthwhile literary criticism left in India that attention is directed to individuals like Ranganayakamma andTruschke?

20+ years ago, the kindly gentleman who helped out at our ashram's kitchen spoke with hope about the day when someone like Rama will return to rule India. But, as we can see with Trump, the ruler and the nation are a good match. Wouldn't it then make sense to leaveTruschke and similarly minded people aside and direct our minds towards higher thoughts?
