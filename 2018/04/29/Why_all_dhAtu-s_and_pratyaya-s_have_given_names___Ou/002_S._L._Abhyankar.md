Dear Mr. Subramanian,

  

Your single-line question can be answered only with some lengthy details.

दृश् पश्य are not alternate forms.

1.  पश्य is imperative mood, second person, singular of the verbal
    rootदृश्.
2.  Explaining howदृश् becomes पश्यwill require explaining a
    long-winding प्रक्रिया

दा and यच्छ are certainly connected. Butयच्छ is not a verbal root. The verbal root धातु is दा only.

In Apte's dictionary दा isdetailed as =>

दा I. 1 P. (यच्छति, दत्त\] To give, grant. -With प्रति to exchange; तिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति माषान् Sk.

-II. 2. P. (दाति) To cut; ददाति द्रविणं भूरि दाति दारिद्र्यमर्थिनाम् K. R.

-III. 4 P. (दायति) To bind (?).

-IV. 3 U. (ददाति, दत्ते; ददौ-ददे, अदात्-अदित, दास्यति-ते, दातुम्, दत्त; but with आ the*p. p.*is आत्त; with उप, उपात्त; with नि, निदत्त or नीत्त, and with प्र, प्रदत्त or प्रत्त)**1**To give, grant, bestow, offer, yield, impart, present (usually with acc. of the thing and dat., sometimes gen. or loc. also, of the person); अवकाशं किलोदन्वान् रामायाभ्यर्थितो ददौ R.4.58; सेचनघटैः बालपादपेभ्यः पयो दातुमित एवाभिवर्तते Ś.1; Ms.3.31;9.271; कथमस्य स्तनं दास्ये Hariv.**-2**To pay (as debt, fine &c.).**-3**To hand or deliver over.**-4**To restore, return.**-5**To give up, sacrifice, surrender; प्राणान् दा to sacrifice one's life; so आत्मानं दा to sacrifice oneself.**-6**To put, place, apply, plant कर्णे करं ददाति &c.**-7**To give in marriage; यस्मै दद्यात् पिता त्वेनाम् Ms.5. 151; Y.2.146;3.24.**-8**To allow, permit (usually with inf.); बाष्पस्तु न ददात्येनां द्रष्टुं चित्रगतामपि Ś.6.22. (The meanings of this root may be variously modified or extended according to the noun with which it is connected;

1.  मनो दा to think, direct the mind to anything; नीतौ मनो दीयते
    Mu.2.5;
2.  अवकाशं दा to give place to, make room; (see अवकाश);
3.  कर्णं दा to give ear to or listen;
4.  दर्शनं दा to show oneself to, grant audience to;
5.  शब्दं दा to make a noise;
6.  तालं दा to clap the hands;
7.  आत्मानं खेदाय दा to expose oneself to trouble;
8.  आतपे दा to expose to the sun's heat;
9.  आज्ञाम्, निदेशं दा to issue orders, command;
10. आशिषं दा to pronounce a blessing;
11. चक्षुः, दृष्टिं दा to cast a glance, see;
12. वाचं दा to address a speech to;

17. वरं दा to grant a boon;
18. संग्रामं दा to fight;
19. अर्गलं दा to bolt, fasten or secure with a latch;
20. निगडं दा to put in chains, fetter;
21. संकेतं दा to make an appointment;
22. शापं दा to curse;
23. वृत्तिं दा to enclose, fence in;
24. अग्निं, पावकं दा to set on fire, &c. &c.

*-Caus*(दापयति-ते) To cause to give, grant, &c.

*-Desid.*(दित्सति-ते) To wish to give, &c.  

I have formatted, by bullets as above, the details available in the dictionary. It may be noted thatधातु दा has verb-forms by 4 classes, as 1P, 2P, 4P and 3U. Meanings in 1P and 3U are fairly synonymous. But meanings in 2P and 4P are quite different. Obviously, one uses verb-forms of that class, which would convey the intended meaning.

1.  Actuallyधातु-s are also used with different prefixes, called as
    उपसर्ग-s. And (!)उपसर्ग-s may often cause a drastic change in the
    meaning. For example if commonly used meaning ofदा is "to give",
    with theउपसर्ग आ, meaning of आदा becomes "to take" (!)
