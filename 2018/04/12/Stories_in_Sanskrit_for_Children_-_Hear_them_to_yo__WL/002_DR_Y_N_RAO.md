Dear Mr. Ramesh,  
  

Very nice effort indeed!  
  

Could you provide the Links of the relevant Stories in Sanskrit in PDF Format?  
  

Further, do you have any idea about Songs in Sanskrit for Children duly sung along with their Transcripts (Lyrics) in Sanskrit in PDF Format?  
  

Please respond at the earliest.  

  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
