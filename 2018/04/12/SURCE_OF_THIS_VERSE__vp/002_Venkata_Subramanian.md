To Sri.Gopalan Sampath  
I do not know much about Vaishnava Sampradayam.  
But Late Sri. Sengalipuram Anantarama Dikshitar is a scholar. He had specifically mentioned about reciting.this shlokam 12 times before commencing Sundarakanda Parayanam.  
Please give me the source from which this verse is taken.
