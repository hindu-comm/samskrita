Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Sri Vinayaka Chaturthi** falls on 13-Sep-2018 (Thu), I am delighted to share a very rare hymn on **Lord Vinaya** titled **Kapardi Vinayaka Stotram** as told by Goddess Parvati. It is taken from **Skanda Puranam, Prabhasa Khandam, Chapter 39** titled **Kapardi Vinayaka Mahatmyam**. Presumably this hymn is on Lord Vinayaka in a temple in Prabhasa Kshetra in Gujarat.

  

The brief **Phalashruti** mentions that one who chants this hymn once/twice/thrice a day for 6 months gets one's rightful wishes fulfilled and attains **Siddhi** of this stotra in one year. He is removed of all obstacles, gets the benefit of bathing in all holy waters and performing all Yajnas. He never faces any setbacks.

  

Readers might remember that Lord Narayana mentions Lord Vinayaka to be an Amsa of Lord Krishna in Brahma Vaivarta Purana. The same point is mentioned in **Garga Samhita, Vishvajit Khanda, Chapter 25 as below by Pradyumna (Lord Krishna's son to Sage Narada)**.

  

**shrIkRRiShNasya kalA sAxAt gaNesho.ayaM mahAbalaH \|\|**

  

Meaning : ***Lord Ganesha is indeed the Kala (Amsa) of Lord Krishna. ...***

  

So, it is needless to repeat that the apparent deity differences and their relative superiority/inferiority are pure hallucinations of the uninitiated and dull-witted who would do well to spend their precious time on useful pursuits that will benefit themselves and mankind! We have seen tons of references in puranas corroborating this point.

  

May We pray to Lord Ganesha with a prayer to remove all obstacles we face towards attaining true knowledge!
