‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç üôè,



This is Sushant Ratnaparkhi, an avid follower of [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) and a great fan of your work. I wish to introduce ReSanskrit, an online community that is working towards making Sanskrit popular among the young millennials.



I started ReSanskrit in late 2016 as an Instagram channel by posting useful Subhashits with their meaning, transliteration along with beautiful designs. After almost 2 years, ReSanskrit has garnered almost 75000+ followers and it is growing very fast.



Here are some links for your reference,

website: [resanskrit.com](http://resanskrit.com)

instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/resanskrit/>

facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/resanskrit>



My aim is to make Sanskrit popular via showcasing the great knowledge our literature has in a very detailed yet consumable, fun and simple way. One way of achieving that is to make Sanskrit text visible in day-to-day common areas, hence I started selling Sanskrit wall posters and frames at a very nominal cost on my [website](https://resanskrit.com/shop/). I have many more ideas to achieve this objective, and slowly, I am working towards that.



About me? I do not have any degree or formal education in Sanskrit apart from what I learned in school (8-10 std). In fact, I am a senior marketing manager for a multinational firm as my full-time occupation, I invest my personal time in ReSanskrit as this is my passion.



I am writing this email to let you know that I am open to any sort of suggestions, feedback or collaboration. I would love to discuss many things with you to improve my understanding and knowledge.



Please let me know if we can have a discussion. My contact details are mentioned below.



Warm regards,

Sushant Ratnaparkhi
