Hi everyone,

I would like to know if there is a portal, that can help create simple statements in sanskrit from english.

  

Forexample:

I would like know if there is a book - translated to sanskrit.  

  

Pardon my ignorance if there's already an email on this topic.

  

Regards,  
Rama Krishna G.V.
