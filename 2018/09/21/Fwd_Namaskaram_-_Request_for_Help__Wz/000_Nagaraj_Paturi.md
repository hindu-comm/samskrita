Namaskaram Prof. Paturi Nagaraj garu,  
  
At the outset, congratulations to you on being chosen the Director of Indic Academy.  
  
One of our Professors -- 86-year old Swami Gyan Swaroop Sanand (formerly Prof. G.D.Agrawala of IIT Kanpur) is on a fast-unto-deathfor over 90 days now in Haridwar for saving Ganga taking only lime juice. Swami Sanand has announced that starting 10th October, he will stop taking water also. We started a petition to the Prime Minister on Change.org -- you may like to take a look at the same here below:

Please take a look, read, endorse, sign and share this petition with your contacts and students.

  

We approached the Minister for Ganga Rejuvenation Sri Nitin Gadkari and a host of leaders in New Delhi including RSS Jt. Gen. Secretary - Shri Krishna Gopal Sharma ji -- who is said to the pointsman from RSS to the Prime Minister. We do not see much hope as yet. As you are aware, the "development" leading to "destruction" is a sign for depraving India. Ganga is symbolic of that.

  

In anticipation of a favourable response,

Sincerely,

Pranav
