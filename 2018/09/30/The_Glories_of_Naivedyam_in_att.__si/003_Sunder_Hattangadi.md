Taff,

  

        It was a 'free association', ad hoc response to my own curiosity about the word, as the dictionaries (M-W and Apte) failed to satisfy it, though it was triggered by the thread.

  

         M-W 1899 revised edition - 1997 13th reprint does not even have the entry for 'naivedyam'. It is given under 'nivid' as a cross-reference for 'nivedaka', with Rajat(arangini) as the source.

  

         Apte 3 vol. dictionary just gives the definition, without etymology or source.

  

         For further study Vachaspatyam is available at:

         Thank you for your understanding.

  

sunder
