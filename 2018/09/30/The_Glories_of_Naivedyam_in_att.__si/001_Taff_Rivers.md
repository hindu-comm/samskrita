Sunder,

  

 Please post under the running thread, along with a ref. to the particular post that you are responding to.  

  
So, in regard to your***in att.***

 It turns out to have been sourced from the original 1872 Monier-Williams which has been superceded bythe revised 1899 edition.

 Where the entry is also there on Huet's web site, in shortenedform. viz.

  

  (H3) \[Cologne record ID=112380\] \[Printed book page 570,1\]

  nai—vedya n. an offering of eatables presented to a deity or idol, BhP. (cf, RTL. 144, 415 )

  

  The same info. as is in my paper volume.

  

 As to spelling(s); to this eye, untrained in the art of ligatures, I have been interpreting the squiggle**द्य, as a**ध -**adyafor adha!  

  

Thank you for your patience.

  

 Taff-Rivers
