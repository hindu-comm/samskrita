It is not the question of samasa of hayagreeva, but the you doubt about the incarnation,\]\]Here is the vicky article on Hayagreeva:

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayagriva>  

  

It contains legends of Hayagreeva and iinformation on the temples devoted to this deity.. In any case, hyagreeva means horse faced whether someone fitted to a human body by surgery or as incarnation of Vishnu.
