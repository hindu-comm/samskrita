कम्बुरिव ग्रीवा यस्य स कम्बुग्रीवः! Correct. उपमितसमासः! with कम्बुः

But हयस्येव मुखं यस्य स हयग्रीवः In this, it is not horse that is conpared, but the face of horse conpared with the face of हयग्रीव. So that is not any discrepancy at all in the description, but it's a fact described. Error is in yound formation.

  

Please follow the gender of the words in the components of your compound formation.
