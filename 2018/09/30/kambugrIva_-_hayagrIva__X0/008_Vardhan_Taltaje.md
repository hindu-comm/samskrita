Shri Sitarama,  
  
Though Hayagriva is the popular name and it literally translates to one having Horse's neck, the Purana story indicates that the face was also of a horse.  
  
This information is from the 'Purana-Nama-Chudamani' book of 1958 edition in Kannada, which describes in brief how Vishnu got horse's face. It quotes Devi-Bhagavata (1-5) and MahaBharata Udyoga parva (130) as the sources. There were also two Rakshasas by same name and one of them was killed by Vishnu (again sources are Devi-Bhagavata 1-5, MahaBharata Shanti Parva 122, 347, 357). All these are from the same book.  
  
Hope this helps you to check this further. If you want, I can take photos of the relevant pages from the book and post it here, but note that it is in Kannada.
