In my thinking I was clear when I made this statement in my OP  

"कम्बुग्रीव people do not put a conch in the place of a Rama's head. But at the same time when हयग्रीव reference comes people depict him with a horse head" Can someone please help me understand this discrepancy?   

  

I am sorry if I did not make it clear. I will more careful in the future.  

Thank you all for your feedback
