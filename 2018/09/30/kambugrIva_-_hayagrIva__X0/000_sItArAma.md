I find it very interesting to see the representation of these two words -

in रामायणम् - राम was described asकम्बुग्रीव

  

कम्बुग्रीव people do not put a conch in the place of a Rama's head. But at the same time when हयग्रीव reference comes people depict him with a horse head.  

Can someone please help me understand this discrepancy?  

I think because Conch can not speak & have human features. This problem does not arise if you put a horse head. Conch does not have a well formed mouth but a horse does to recite words.

उष्ट्र इव मुखं यस्य - उष्ट्रमुखम्

कम्बु इव ग्रीवं यस्य -कम्बुग्रीव

हय इव ग्रीवं यस्य -हयग्रीव

Is there any other type of समास one can do to resolve thisproblem?

Thanks for yourhelp
