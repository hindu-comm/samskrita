Horse necked should not be depicted as shown in the image below - that was my issue.  

The picture did not appear like Horse neck, someone managed to put a horse head on human shoulder. Is this representation correct?  

Written sciprt was not invented till much later times, so how did Vishnu rescue orally transmitted Vedas? Wrong representation can ruin many things.
