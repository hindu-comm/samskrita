There's also an avatar of Vishnu with horse's head:  

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayagriva>  

  

Probably that's the basis of portraying Rama also with a horse's head.

  

A Sanskrit-Malayalam dictionary lists words such asकम्बुग्रीवा, कम्बुग्रीवः, कम्बुकण्ठः, कम्बुकण्ठी, etc., to mean 'shell-necked', i.e., someone beautiful, handsome, etc.,

  

हयग्रीवः meanings are listed as 'horse-necked', Vishnu, the asura who stole the vedas, etc.,  

  

The dictionary also lists a wordहयग्रीवहन् (हयग्रीवहा in nominative singular) as a synonym for Vishnu because in his avatara as Matsya, he kills this asura हयग्रीवः and rescues the vedas. Thus, both हयग्रीवः and हयग्रीवहा mean Vishnu.

  

As an aside, the tortoise that falls to its death mid-flight (a Panchatantra story) has कम्बुग्रीव as its name:

The story in Panchatantra begins like this: अस्ति कस्मिंश्चिज्जलाशये कम्बुग्रीवो नाम कच्छपः।

  

I think it'll make a great name for a pet tortoise (of course only when it has come out of its shell and its neck is visible :D)
