Sri Sitaram-ji,

  

You started the thread with a question similar to the question about two different English pronunciations of the same spelling in 'put ' and 'but' . Why the word griva should mean two different things in two different samasas, kambugriva and hayagriva ? Now you are gradually moving into "this corruption came into our mythology".

  

Children understand Harry Potter stories, Narnia stories , believe in/enjoy the stories of lions speaking in human voice and participating in human politics and so on.

  

Half animal half human forms etc. are easily accepted by them as part of such an imaginative world.

  

If we can explain to them the encryption aspects in such representations of Vedic concepts, this data security hacking obsessed generation can easily understand.
