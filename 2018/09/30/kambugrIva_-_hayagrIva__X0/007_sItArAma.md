Thank you Dr. Bhat,

  

So in essence instead of investing why this corruption came into our mythology we have to accept the temples, status and wiki article as authentic information about our texts.

Thats definitely a good way to perpetuate ignorance to next generation.
What will be the next step in degeneration, that some centaur sitting in sky will punish me if I do not pray to him. Is this the division we are supposed to pass to the next generation?

  

Believeit or not kids ask questions like, why we worship a stone who cannot move, Why he has horse face. I guess we can just tell them to shut up or call it blasphemy and give them time outs.
