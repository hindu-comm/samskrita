I agree with Shri Nagaraj Paturi entirely. If we take pains at first to clear our perceptions, convincing children or correcting the childhood logic should not be a problem. Faith and belief is the core.  
Even in science there are theories like quantum mechanics and relativity which can solve problems but in a different approach. They too have conflicts. But one theory is not banished because of conflict. Both are applied where appropriate and validated.  
Children fortunately may throw unbounded questions but can also be convinced if explained.  
My 2c worth!
