Namaste,

  

Since I could not find any other edition of Stavamala, I checked Bengali edition of Stavamala with Jiva Goswami's commentary. There too, the quote is as in Kavyamala edition, but free from typos. It is 'उभे उ हैबैष एते तरत्यमृतः साध्बसाधुनी ॥'.

The commentary merely says 'sruteh', Br. Up. is not mentioned by name. So, the quote could be from some other source or it could be from the Kanva recension of Br. Up. I could not access Kanva recension of Br. Up. to verify this.  

  

regards  
shankara
