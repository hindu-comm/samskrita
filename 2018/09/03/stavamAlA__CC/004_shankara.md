Namaste,

  

I had also seen similar citations in Google search. When I checked the Br. Up. text at Adviatasharada site and several editions of Br. Up., there is some difference in the text.

  

उभे उ हैवैष एते तरति नैनं कृताकृते तपतः ॥ २२ ॥

  

<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Brha#BR_C04_S04>

  

Could you find the quote in printed editions of Br. Up.?

shankara
