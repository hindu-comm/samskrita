I discovered that the quote refers toबृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् (४.४.२२)  

  

उभे उ हैवैष एते तरति, नैनं कृताकृते तपतः ॥ २२ ॥  

  

I wonder why there are so many discrepancies in the texts cited.

I do not think that Paṇḍit Bhavadatta Śāstrī  can make such mistakes, so I think he is referring to other versions.

Thank you for your valuable contributions.
