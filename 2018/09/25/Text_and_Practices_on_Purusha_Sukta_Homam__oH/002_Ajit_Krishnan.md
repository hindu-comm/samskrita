Namaste,

  

The oldest source that I’ve come across is the madana maharnava karma vipaka. It has an entire section on this homa. It’s too long to effectively summarize here.

  

There is another simpler tradition where the riks of the purusha sukta are offered as well, with just the standard purvanga / uttaranga.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
