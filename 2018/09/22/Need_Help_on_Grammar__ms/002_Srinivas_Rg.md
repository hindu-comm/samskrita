Respected H N Bhat Sir,  

Thanks indeed.

I understand that something is wrong with मम मातृचरणाः सीतानाम्न्यः  

Is it more like the sentence is grammatically correct  

but excessively formal? Is not नाम्न्यः the plural for नाम्नी ?

  

Thanks for your time and patience.

Regards,

Srinivas

  

PS: In my school and college, when I had great teachers like H S Varadadeshikar (and the rest) I wasted the opportunity. Do please teach me now!
