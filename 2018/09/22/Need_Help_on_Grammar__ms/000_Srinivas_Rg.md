नमो विद्वद्भयः \| I salute the respected scholars in this group।

  

Suppose I want to convey that my mother's name is Sita. So I can say मम मातुः नाम सीता।

  

But I want to use मातृचरणानां in place of मातुः। So, can I say मम मातृचरणानाम् नाम सीता ?

  

Also, is it grammatically correct to say मम माता सीता नाम ?

  

Further, is it correct to say मम माता सीता नाम्नी ?

If this is correct, then it is probably

correct to say मम मातृचरणाः सीता नाम्न्यः

  

Now let us look at the पुल्लिंग equivalent of this.

  

I want to say my guru is Rangacharya. So I can say मम गुरोः नाम रङ्गाचार्यः

  

But can I say मम गुरुचरणानाम् नाम रङ्गाचार्यः ?

  

Also, is it grammatically correct to say मम गुरुः रङ्गाचार्य नाम ?  

  

Further, is it grammatically correct to say मम गुरुचरणाः रङ्गाचार्य नामनः ?  

  

Thank you all very much indeed.

  

Regards,

  

Srinivas
