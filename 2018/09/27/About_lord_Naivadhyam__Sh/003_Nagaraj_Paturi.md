That the mantra bhaaga of the Veda is meant only for indirectly instructing to perform yajna is an argument. This argument is central to meemaamsaa. Foundations/seeds of meemaamsaa are there in braamhaNas and aaraNyakas.

  

To some extent, some details of some yajnas are also described in those sections of the Vedas.

  

For that matter, some suktas themselves have description of yajna.

  

Havis, for example, is the Vedic equivalent of naivedya. Havis is mentioned in purusha sookta and other suktas. Viewed that way we can say equivalent of naivedya is mentioned in the Veda mantras.

  

I was just trying to explain the systematisation of the procedures in the Vedic tradition.
