1\. We should not check for Physics practicals in Physics theory book. Manual of Physics practicals needs to be consulted.

  

2\. Vedas do not detail the procedures of yajnas. Yajnas are practicals. Mostly preserved in the memory of the practitioners. To some extent kalpa granthas , s'routa sutras etc. help.

  

3\. Similarly puraaNas do not give pooja practicals. Aagamas give. Aagamas deal mostly with temple routines which include naivedyam. Household pooja routines have been compiled in some later books. Those include naivedyam. Like yajna, these practicals too are mostly from the memory of the practitioners.
