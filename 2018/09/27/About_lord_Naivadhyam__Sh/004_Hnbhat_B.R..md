I am surprised to see this request "lord  
naivedhyam".

  

As I can understand, it is नैवेद्यम् is not any lord, but the thing of offerings made to the devata as per Vacaspathya:

  

न० निवेदं निवेदनमहेति ष्यञ् नि + विद—णिच्  
कर्मणि यत् स्वार्थे अण् वा ।“निवेदनीयं द्रब्यन्तु

नैवेद्यमितिकथ्यते”इति स्मृत्युक्ते देवतोद्देशेन त्यक्तव्ये द्रव्ये!

  

How it can be a lord or if the word is taken to mean the god or devata of sacrifice or offering? That too searching for the lord naivedhyam (wrong spelling) in Vedas?

  

Many have replied only Prof.Nagaraj has has given the equilent havis, used in Yaga or homa. Thanks.
