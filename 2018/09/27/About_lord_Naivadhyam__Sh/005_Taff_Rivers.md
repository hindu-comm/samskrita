Chandra et al,

  

It is apparent that the concept of नैवेद्य (naivedha) is badly expressed, especially by those for that do so in 'English' as a second language.

Even the mighty Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naivedhya> has a variety of definitions.

  

Not to say two different English spellings of the Sanskrit, both wrong.

  

There, as here in this forum, the English equivalents of the Sanskrit are inaccurate.

To this English speaker,*naivedha*means the ritual offering of food to a deity or idol so that it may be blessed.

A *deity*is neither The Lord nor God (The Supreme Being).

Again, neither 'Physics' nor 'practicals' are correct terms. A ritual *is* a practice. Physics has nothing to do with it.

As to what kind(s) of food, what deity, and when or where or how the ritual is performed, and by whom...

  

However, the general idea does emerge from the fog.

  

Someone needs to put Wikipedia to rights - I am not qualified in Indian metaphysics, myself.

  

Regards,
