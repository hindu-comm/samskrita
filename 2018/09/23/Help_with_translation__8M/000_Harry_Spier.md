Dear list members,

  

Any help with translating this line from the commentary of Svayamprakaśa on the Dakṣiṇāmūrtistotram . It is from his commentary on verse 3.

  

The line is:

अयं भावः - जगतोसत्कारणत्वे घटोसन् पटोसन् इत्यसत एव सर्वत्रानुवृत्तिस्स्यात्, न तु सतः \|

This is from Shri Mahadev Shastri's edition of the Daksinamurtistotram of Sri Sankaracharya with commentaries by Suresvaracharya, Svayamprakasa and Ramatirtha and is on page 21. The link to this text is:

<https://archive.org/download/32640411DakshinamurtiStotraWithManasollasa/32640411-Dakshinamurti-Stotra-With-Manasollasa.pdf>  

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
