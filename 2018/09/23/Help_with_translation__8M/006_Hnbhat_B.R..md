अनिर्वचनीयाः means indefinable. Neither non-existent or existent; hence said equal to non-existent.

  

They are not existing independently and existing only dependent on brahman. Hence the world is called अनिर्वचनीय in advaita philosophy.  
स्वतः सत्तारहिताः means without having existence independently.

  

The rest is explained in my translation.
