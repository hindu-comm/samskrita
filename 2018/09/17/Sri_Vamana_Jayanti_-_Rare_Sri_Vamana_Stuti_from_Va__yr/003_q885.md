I realized my conversion file was missing the avagraha. Apparently in Grantha it looks like a "Z" instead of an "S"? I have attached what I hope is a corrected version.

  

Also I realized in my message I wrote "Śakte" instead of "Śaktē". I always try to use the macron (optional in ISO 15919 when transcribing Sanskrit) over the "ē" and "ō". I think it serves to remind, especially to the beginner, that they are always long. It also allows one to use the same transliteration scheme with Prakrit, which does have short "e" and "o". But sometimes I forget. So please allow me to correct my error.
