Recently I came across this sloka attributed to Aryabata in "Jyotishchandrikaa" (available at [archive.org](http://archive.org)).

  

उदयो यो लङ्कायां सोऽस्तमयः सवितुरेव सिद्धपुरे ।

मध्याह्नो यमकोट्यां रोमकविषयेऽर्धरात्रिः स्यात् ॥

  

And the book quotes Siddhanata Shiromani of Bhaskaracharya to give exactly the same position for all the four cities.

  

From this, Lanka and Siddhapura are located on opposite side of the surface of the earth ( 12 hours of time difference), Yamakoti and town of Romaka on the opposite side of each other ( Yamakoti 6 hours behind Lanka, and the city of Romakas 18 hours behind Lanka).

  

If we assume longitude of Lanka to be 0 degree, the longitude of Yamakoti would be 90 degrees West, that of Siddhapur 180 degrees West, and that of Romaka 90 degrees East.  

  

This position must have examined and the four cities clearly identified. I hope I would learn a lot from your responses.
