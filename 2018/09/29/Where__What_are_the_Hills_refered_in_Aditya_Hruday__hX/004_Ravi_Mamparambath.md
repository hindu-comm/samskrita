No reference of the names of the hills are found by myself.

Aditya Hridayam, is a hymn associated with the Sun or Surya and was recited by the great sage Agastya to Rama on the battlefield before fighting with Ravana. This historic hymn starts at the beginning of the duel between Shri Rama with Ravana himself. Sage Agastya teaches Lord Rama, who is fatigued after the long battle with various fighters of Lanka, this procedure of worshiping Surya for strength to defeat the enemy.

Having found Ráma weary with fighting and buried in deep thought, and Rávan standing before him ready to engage in battle, the holy Agastya, who had come to see the battle, approached Ráma and spoke to him thus: "O mighty Ráma, listen to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy foes in the battle. Having daily repeated the Ádityahridaya (the delighter of the mind of the Sun) the holy prayer which destroys all enemies (of him who repeats it) gives victory, removes all sins, sorrows and distress, increases life, and which is the blessing of all blessings, worship the rising and splendid sun who is respected by both the Gods and demons, who gives light to all bodies and who is the rich lord of all the worlds, (To the question why this prayer claims so great reverence; the sage answers) Since yonder \* sun is full of glory and all gods reside in him (he being their material cause) and bestows being and the active principle on all creatures by his rays; and since he protects all deities, demons and men with his rays.

  

He is Brahmá, Vishnu, Siva, Skanda, Prajápati, Mahendra, Dhanada, Kála, Yama, Soma, Apàm Pati i.e. The lord of waters, Pitris, Vasus, Sádhyas, Asvins, Maruts, Manu, Váyu, Vahni, Prajá, Prána, Ritukartá, Prabhákara, (Thou, art) Aditya, Savitá, Súrya, Khaga, Púshan, Gabhastimán, Suvarnasadris'a, Bhánu, Hiranyaretas, Divákara, Haridas'va, Sahasrárchish, Saptasapti, Marichimán, Timironmathana, Sambhu, Twashtá, Mártanda, Ans'umán, Hiranyagarbha, Sis'ira, Tapana, Ahaskara, Ravi, Agnigarbha, Aditiputra, Sankha, Sis'iranás'ana, Vyomanátha, Tamobhedí, Rigyajussámapáraga, Ghanavríshti. Apám-Mitra, Vindhyavíthíplavangama, A'tapí, Mandalí, Mrityu (death), Pingala, Sarvatápana, Kavi, Vis'va, Mahátejas, Rakta, Sarvabhavodbhava. The Lord of stars, planets, and other luminous bodies, Vis'vabhávana, Tejasvinám-Tejasvi, Dwádas'átman: I salute thee, I salute thee who art the eastern mountain. I salute thee who art the western mountain. I salute thee who art the Lord of all the luminous bodies. I salute thee who art the Lord of days.

  

I respectfully salute thee who art Jaya, Jayabhadra, Haryas'va, O Thou who hast a thousand rays, I repeatedly salute thee. I repeatedly and respectfully salute thee who art A'ditya, I repeatedly salute thee who art Ugra, Víra, and Sáranga. I salute thee who openest the lotuses (or the lotus of the heart). I salute thee who art furious. I salute thee who art the Lord of Brahmá, S'iva and Vishnu. I salute thee who art the sun, A'dityavarchas, splendid, Sarvabhaksha, and Raudravapush.

  

I salute thee who destroyest darkness, cold and enemies: whose form is boundless, who art the destroyer of the ungrateful; who art Deva; who art the Lord of the luminous bodies, and who appearest like the heated gold. I salute thee who art Hari, Vis'vakarman, the destroyer of darkness, and who art splendid and Lokasákshin. Yonder sun destroys the whole of the material world and also creates it. Yonder sun dries (all earthly things), destroys them and causes rain with his rays. He wakes when our senses are asleep; and resides within all beings. Youder sun is Agnihotra and also the fruit obtained by the performer of Agnihotra. He is identified with the gods, sacrifices, and the fruit of the sacrifices. He is the Lord of all the duties known to the world, if any man, O Rághava, in calamities, miseries, forests and dangers, prays to yonder sun, he is never overwhelmed by distress.

  

Worship, with close attention Him the God of gods and the Lord of the world; and recite these verses thrice, whereby thou wilt be victorious in the battle. O brave one, thou wilt kill Rávana this very instant."

  

Thereupon Agastya having said this went away as he came. The glorious Ráma having heard this became free from sorrow. Rághava whose senses were under control, being pleased, committed the hymn to memory, recited it facing the sun, and obtained great delight. The brave Ráma having sipped water thrice and become pure took his bow, and seeing Rávana, was delighted, and meditated on the sun.
