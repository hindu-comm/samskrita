In Aditya hrudayam following lines are found-

  

नम: पूर्वाय गिरये पस्छिमे गिरये नम:  
ज्योतिर्गनानाम् ......  

  

The poem is reportedly an utterance of Agasthya to SriRama at the battlefield in SriLanka.

Which are these hills referenced as being in Northerly and Southern aspects to the battlefield?
