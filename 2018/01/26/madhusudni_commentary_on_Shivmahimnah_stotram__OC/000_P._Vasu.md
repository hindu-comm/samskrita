Dear members,

  

I am trying to get a copy of a publication of Pushpadanta's Shivmahimnah Stotram which has a commentary in Sanskrit by Madhusudan Saraswati (with anvay and translation and annotations in Hiindi - (by NarayanTripathi, I think, not sure )

I had got it from a library about 5 years ago but now it is missing and their revamped catalog does not have any useful details

Can anyone identify the book and tell me where a copy (hard/soft) would available from?

Thanks and regards

  

Parameswaran Vasu
