Notes  
By far the best Hindi translation of the RgVeda  
Low price

  

The Vedas need no introduction. The ṚgVeda plays a pivotal role in establishing the Vedic faith and is widely revered as the first text to emerge from India.

  

For centuries, the Vedas have been translated into various languages. Pioneering translations in Western languages coexist with brilliantly insightful translations and exegetical works in Sanskrit as well as modern Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, etc. 

  

There are several excellent translations in Hindi available with us. But this one by Mahāmahopādhyāya Dr Govind Chandra Pandey is unique for the following reasons:

  

-   Each sūkta {Vedic hymn} is given with proper numbering and indexing

-   At the beginning of each sūkta, the name of the ṛṣi {seer} who
    composed it, the deva {god} it addresses, and the chanda {metre} in
    which it has been composed, is mentioned

-   Each ṛcā {sacred verse} is translated into Hindi poetry

-   Each ṛcā is also translated into Hindi prose

-   The ādhi-yājñika {related to Vedic rituals}, ādhi-bhautika
    {worldly}, ādhi-daivika {religious} and ādhyātmika {spiritual}
    aspects of mantras are highlighted

-   Traditional as well modern exegetical techniques have been used in
    the explanation

-   All mantras of the ṚgVeda are listed alphabetically in the index

  

Publishing this work was the dream of leading Hindi publisher Dinesh Chandra Grover. Mr Grover lived a long and active life and published many important books in Hindi. But his memory shall forever be cherished for creating this milestone in Indian publishing.

  

This set should be a part of all libraries that carry books on Sanskrit and South Asian studies. It should be a part of individual collections as well as the collections of pāṭhaśālās, jñānaśālās and school, college, university and temple libraries. We are delighted to make this work available through our bookstore and by mail order. We ship books within the country and internationally.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
