Hi friends,

attached is a version of Gayatri mantra.

  

Can someone tell me how the notation of the melody is supposed to be interpreted?

  

Of course I do understand that the sound of a syllable notated on the lower line is supposed to be chanted with a lower frequency note than the ones on the middle and upper lines, but I don't see why there are black squares and white circles used. There's no connection for instance with laghu and guru of the syllables, so what can it possibly mean?

Thanks :-)
