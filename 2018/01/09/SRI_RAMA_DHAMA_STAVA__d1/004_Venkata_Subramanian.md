Sri.Ramesh,Shrivathsa,  
The book appears to have been published by Madras Sanskrit Education Soceity some years ago.But copies are not available now.Sri Vighneswara Venkateswara Trust Chennai also was contacted by me.There also it is not readily available.  
From Google Books also no help is available.  
The author has given advaita view point of SriRama based on Taittriya Upanishad.  
I have read the commentary of Sri Rama Dhama Stava by ,Late Muthukrishna Sastrigal in Tamil.  
I wish to read the original commentary in Sanskrit(devanagari script) if possible to get copies of these books.  
Any help will be appreciated
