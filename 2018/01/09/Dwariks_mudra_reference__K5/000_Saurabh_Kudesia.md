HARI OM!

  

I need some help from the experts on this forum:

  

This link: <http://www.prardhana.com/secrets-of-dwaraka.html>

  

mentions that "the most famous rectangular seal with engraved motifs of bull, unicorn and goat found in trench UW6 in the sea bed was dated as belonging to 16th century BC. The seal corroborates the references made in the ancient manuscripts that every citizen of Dwarka was required to carry a mudra (seal) as a mark of identification."

  

On multiple research I found that the scripture Harivamsa was source of this information which "strongly refers that every citizen of Dwaraka needs to carry a mudra or seal of the type".

  

However, I am not able to exactly locate the slok (s) that highlights this information in Harivamsa or in Mahabharata.

  

Can anyone on this group point me to the exact reference of the slok in any of the scripture that capture this information?

  

Regards,

Saurabh
