  A proposal that the early transcriptions of the Vedas used an explicit graphical notation for speech sounds based on vocal tract diagrams and an orthography was developed to depict speech sounds visually, to record and pronounce the Vedas precisely.This proposes developing an articulatory phonetic notation system to reconnect speech sounds with glyphs and the spoken language with written language, by rediscovering the "protoSanskrit" orthography through analysis of Sanskrit.  

  ProtoSanskrit will be based on glyphs with explicit articulatory notation, with rules similar to Sanskrit for scripting, diacritics and pronunciation, including short/long speech sound discrimination. The orthography of protoSanskrit will be related to Sanskrit texts and calligraphy.
