महाकवि भर्तृहरि कृतं शतकत्रयम्

BHARTRIHARI’S SHATAKA-TRAYAM

Sanskrit is one of the most revered ancient languages in the world. Enriched by contributions from some of the greatest minds known to mankind, it is surpassingly rich in content and form. It is an infinite treasure trove of the most precious gems.

Among the brightest jewels in its casket, is Bhartrihari’s Shataka-Trayam. The great poet wrote three masterpieces of a hundred verses each, each thematically different from the other.

-   नीतिशतकम् Niti Shatakam {100 Verses on Ethics}

-   शृंगारशतकम् Shringara Shatakam {100 Verses on Love and Passion}

-   वैराग्यशतकम् Vairagya Shatakam {100 Verses on Renunciation}

In all probability, Bhartrihari was a court poet in Classical India. His poetry indicates great familiarity with the ins and outs of statecraft and an awareness of how things worked in the hushed corridors of power. At first glance, his poetry mirrors the aspirations of the common man. However, a close reading would reveal his own sense of disillusionment from worldly life he vacillates between the pursuits of fleshly desires and those of the soul.

Bhartrihari's poetry is aphoristic, and comments on the social mores of the time. He skilfully exposes the perpetual conflict between man's unrelenting desire for sensual gratification and his yearning for liberation. Reading Bhartrihari should be on everyone's bucket list.
