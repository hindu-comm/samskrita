आयरीन्-महोदये !

In my post "[Studying अष्टाध्यायी - How and Why ?](https://grammarofsanskrit.wordpress.com/category/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%80-of-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80/studying-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%80-why-and-how/)" I included derivation of the word अकुर्वत as was provided in September 2013 by श्री. नित्यानन्द मिश्र. The word अकुर्वत gets derived, starting from the धातुः डुकृञ् at the end of some 16 process-steps.

Points, which came up in the present discussion about the word पञ्चतय्यः have been mostly covered in that post. Would you please go through that post and respond ?
