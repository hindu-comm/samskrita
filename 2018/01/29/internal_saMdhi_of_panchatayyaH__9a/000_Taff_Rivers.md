Learned ones,

  

In the familiar verse, "YS  I. 5  Vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ kliṣṭa-akliṣṭāḥ."

*pañcatayyaḥ* is generally interpreted as *fivefold* in English, but whereas the *Vṛttayaḥ* is easily parsed as being the nominative plural of *Vṛtti.*

  

I don't quite understand how enumerations are inflected.

I have dificulty with the*tayyaḥ* bit of*pañcatayyaḥ*.

I thought it may derive from the pronoun *tad*, but *tad* doesn't have a*tayyaḥ* inflection.

Is there a cascading series of anuvṛtti saṃdhi, involved here?

  

Thanks in advance,

  

Taff Rivers.
