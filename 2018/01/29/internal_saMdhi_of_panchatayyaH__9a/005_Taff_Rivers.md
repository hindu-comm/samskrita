Gentlemen,

  

The missing piece in the jigsaw that is Sanskrit Grammar, that I have been keen to obtain, namely तयप् (tayap) would appear to be a technical term.  

  

In the Grammar of the famous Pāṇini himself, I learn:

  

2\. bha

• (in gram.) N. of the weakest base of nouns (as opp. to pada and aṅga, q.v.)

i.e. of the base before the vowel terminations except in strong cases,

before feminine suffixes,

and before Taddhitas beginning with vowels or y,

Pāṇ. 1-4, 18 &c. \[742,2\]

  

Thanking you all,

  

Taff Rivers

  

p.s.

  

I found "A Dictionary Of Sanskrit Grammar By Kashinath Vasudev Abhyankar" to be most useful, for the likes of myself, especially the text.pdf version, which allows for note-taking.
