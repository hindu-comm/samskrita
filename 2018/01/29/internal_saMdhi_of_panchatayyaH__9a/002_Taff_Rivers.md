Professsor,

  

I understand that the पञ्चतयी has come into it. Thank you.  

  

But what is thisतयप्, Is it some kind of secondary derivation - a noun derived from a noun.

Is that where the two consecutive letter y's of the pañcatayyaḥ come from?

That is what I don't really understand.

  

Thank you again.
