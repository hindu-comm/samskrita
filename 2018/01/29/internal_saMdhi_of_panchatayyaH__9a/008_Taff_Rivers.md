Dt,

  

 You must realise the difficulty here.

  

In some mysterious way, *tayap* has morphed into *tayaP*!

  

Again, I learn from<http://readingpanini.blogspot.co.uk/p/vibhakti.html>  
  
 that there is no iT maker! Some have them, some don't. The ones that don't depend on their sounding.

  

Whilst you do mention the 'sound' in your explanation, you do not provide the necessary the information that the non-sanskrit grammarian will need to get from p to P. Namely that *there is no iT maker! Some have them, some don't. The ones that don't depend on their sounding*.

  

  

Here is the relevant paragraph from<http://readingpanini.blogspot.co.uk/p/vibhakti.html>that this non sanskrit grammarian, making up of 999,999.999% of the worlds population, needs , Sanskrit grammarians are practically extint, and their knowledge, with them!

  

I quote:

"*Here’s another convention regarding these case endings:*

*by combining the initial letter (sound) of an earlier case ending with the last letter of a subsequent case ending,*

*we can make short hand notations for a range of case endings (just like we had pratyāhāra for letters, e.g. iK, aiC, etc.,*

*in fact these are pratyāhāra for case endings):*

*sUP covers all the 21 vibhakti, taking the first sound in sU and the last sound in suP.*

*Similarly, .*.."

  

But again, it is not clear to this member, if that*U* in the aforementioned*sUP*, is an iT marker or a 'sound'...

  

In much the same way as "We have a level four space saturation saturation, here." makes perfect sense to me as computer insider, but makes goobledegook to outsiders.

(It means that the disc holding printout, to be sent to a mainframe's Line Printer is almost full, and unless more space is allocated, will hold up every single users running programs. - A sort of modern day's DDOS or Distributed Denial of Service.

  

Simply put:

  

**What is simple to insiders is incomprehensible to outsiders *- unless retold in simple English (or whatever).***

****

Regards,

I know it's not easy!

I speak as a onetime writer of goobledegook free computer manuals for use at an International Airport (Riyadh) - they take months *to write*, but just a single hour *to be read* and approved (or otherwise) for meeting International standards. (Both of them were so approved.)

  

Don't like doing the documentation? Think what Albert had to do!
