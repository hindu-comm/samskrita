Gentlemen,

  

 Getting technical re, *tayap*...

  

How is the*tayap*concept properly expressed in terms of Panini's iT markers?

  

For example

  

Sutra 1.1.1 vṛddhir **ādaic**

  

is better expressed as vṛddhiḥ **āT aiC.**

  

As to*tayap,*which carries additional information encypted by the letters *ap*, at the termination,

how therefore, should*tayap* be propely expressed - in the IAST transliteration scheme please.

  

Also there is a confusion regarding the employment of cardinal numbers.

Panini employes them not as numbers, but as *types*of case endings\* - whereas *ap*, in the absence of explicit information is otherwise taken to be an inflection - albeit non-existent!.

  

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
