न् at the end of**पञ्चन्**is not considered as

इत् andprocess tasya lopah does not apply here. It is due to ,the processनलोपः प्रातिपदिकान्तस्य VIII. 2. 7 लोपः is directly processed at the end of any प्रातिपदिक which is defined as perकृत्‍तद्धितसमासाश्‍च ।।1/2/46।। as it ending in न्. before the taddhita suffix tayaP.

  

it is differentlt processed in nominative case and accusative case. First जस् शस् are lost due to the operation of

षड्भ्यो लुक् 7-1-22 andनलोपः प्रातिपदिकान्तस्य VIII. 2. 7 .

Hereटिड्ढाणञ्()" (४।१।१।५)feminine suffix ड़ीप् operates due to the suffix tayaP. Inड़ीप् the ड़् becomes इत् and tasya lopah is applied remaining ई to be visible in the femine suffix.

क्तेनाहोरात्रावयवाः does not define avayava.  

It means parts.

  

The detailed process will be longer.
