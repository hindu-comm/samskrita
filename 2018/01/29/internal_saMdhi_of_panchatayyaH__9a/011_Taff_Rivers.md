Exactly what is needed.

  

A liitle light is beginning to shine on the matter.

  

1.3.9 reads *tasya lopaḥ*

*  
*

But there is more to come...

  

I quote from the MW:

**  "the dropping of the whole affix is implied"***  
*

**implied? *where?*  
**

  

lopa

• (in gram.) dropping, elision (generally as distinguished from the terms lup, ślu, luk, which are only applicable to affixes; when lopa of an affix takes place, a blank is substituted, which exerts the same influence on the base as the affix itself, but when either luk or lup or ślu of an affix is enjoined, then the affix is not only dropped but it is also inoperative on the base.

• thus in the 1st pl. of kati, where jas is said to be elided by luk, the change of the final of the base to Guṇa does not take place, i.e. both the affix and its effect on the base are abolished.

• moreover, **lopa refers only to the last letter of an affix, whereas by luk &c. the dropping of the whole affix is implied**), Nir. Prāt. Pāṇ. &c.

  

**Whatever**, what is becoming very clear, is that a great deal ofbackground material, over the miilenia, became detached from theaṣtādhyāyī, itself. Very prominently so isthe*Śivasūtrāṇi*, for example - thedhātupāṭha....

  

Shouldn't we be gringing to mind that this particular grammar, had a very particular purpose - it was designed to appeal to the deities.

Whom it was understood, were duty bound to fulfill such requests.

  

The grammar detailed the correct way to make the *sounds* that they dieties were said to *speak*.

The grammar itself being spoken of by *those that knew such things.*

*  
*

It was *perfected*, so as to satisfy any human doubts and uncertainties. otherwise known as ambiguities.

*  
*

It was designed *(*and perfected) *only* to address the deities. Very much as one way system,- the dieties did not *speak* back!

It was certainly **not** as a two way *written* sytem of communication
between mortals.

  

It is very apparent to all, that said written system is far from perfect, i.e. unambiguous.

  

In fact, in real life, there never was a written grammar - such is non-existent. Any discussion about such a subject can be no more fruitful thandiscussions aboutunicorns or dragons.

  

As to ritual languages, handed down from*those that knew such things*, well, their sources aren't speaking, not to me anyway!

  

regards,
