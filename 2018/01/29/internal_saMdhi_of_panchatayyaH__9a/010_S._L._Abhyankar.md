Dear Mr. Taff Rivers,

  

तयप् is grammatical name of the affix. It applies only to numerals i.e. संख्याशब्द-s, as specified in संख्याया अवयवे तयप् (5'2'42), When affixing, it is to be affixed only asतय.

  

The logic is thatin the grammatical name, तयप् the ending consonantप् qualifies to be an इत् by (हलन्त्यम् 1'3'3). All इत्-sdefined in (1'3'2) to (1'3'8) are to bedropped as per the diktat in तस्य लोपः (1'3'9).

  

Basically तयप् is an affix, which helps to derive adjectives from numerals. Basically numerals are themselves adjectival. So, here the process becomes deriving another adjectival word from an adjective on hand. Affixes which have a role in such secondary derivation are called as तद्धित-affixes.

  

When making feminine adjectives, feminine form ofतय becomes तयी.
