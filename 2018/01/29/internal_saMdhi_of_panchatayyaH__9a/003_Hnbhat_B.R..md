Exactly it is due to internal as sandhi that you see two consecutive yy. The first in the suffix and second due to sandhi. Just like nadyaH where there is no y in the stem, but here there one y in the noun itself and y added due to sandhi.

  

Hope this is clear. The word pancatayii is derived from pancan-taya+I.
