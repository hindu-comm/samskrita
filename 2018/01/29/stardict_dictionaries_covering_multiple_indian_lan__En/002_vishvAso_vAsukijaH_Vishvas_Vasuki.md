An important correction: the URL above is missing a letter - it must have been: <https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/dictionaries/offline/#how-to-install-and-use-dictionaries-on-your-device>

  

A further note for those directly downloading stardict archives:

  

As the updated <https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit> README files says:

-   Dictionaries are built with
    [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/indic-dict) and deployed to
    gh-pages branch of the repository. For example:
    -   [stardict-sanskrit/gh-pages](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit/tree/gh-pages/)
        from
        [stardict-sanskrit](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit)
    -   [stardict-tamil/gh-pages](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-tamil/tree/gh-pages/)
        from
        [stardict-tamil](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-tamil)
