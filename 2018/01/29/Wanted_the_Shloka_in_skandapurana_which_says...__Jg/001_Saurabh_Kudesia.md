**Dashaputrasamaa kanyaa dashaputraan pravardhayan \|**

**Yatphalam labhate martyastallabhyam kanyayaikayaa \|\|**

*-Skandapurana, Kaumarika Khanda, Chapter 23, Verse 46.*

â€œOne daughter is equal to ten sons. Whatever*phala*(merits, good results) a person attains by siring and upbringing ten sons, the same*phala*is attained by begetting a single daughter alone.
