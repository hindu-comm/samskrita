Dear list,

As some of you would have already noticed, the Chhattisgarh tableau at the 69th Republic Day Parade was a befitting tribute to Kalidasa. Some very artistic minds with great attention to detail were involved in designing the tableau on the 300 BCE amphitheatre of Ramgarh, considered the oldest amphitheatre in India.

  

The statue of Kalidasa, the replica of the amphitheatre carved into the rocks, and the graceful dancers stole the show. As the tableau passed, a recording of two verses of Kalidasa’s ‘Meghaduta’ were played. The first part was a chorus singingthe first two quarters of the opening verse of the poem:

कश्चित्कान्ताविरहगुरुणा स्वाधिकारात्प्रमत्तः  
शापेनास्तंगमितमहिमा वर्षभोग्येण भर्तुः।

  
This was followed by a sound of lightning and rain, after which the second part was played in which a chorus sang the full second verse of the ‘Meghaduta’:  
  

तस्मिन्नद्रौ कतिचिदबलाविप्रयुक्तः स कामी  
नीत्वा मासान्कनकवलयभ्रंशरिक्तप्रकोष्ठः।  
आषाढस्य प्रथमदिवसे मेघमाश्लिष्टसानुं  
वप्रक्रीडापरिणतगजप्रेक्षणीयं ददर्श॥

  

In addition, the full second verse, along with the number, was inscribed in Devanagari script on the tablet in the left hand of Kalidasa’s statue. See the second image and compare it with the third.

There was some artistic freedom involved also as Devanagari was not the script used by Kalidasa. However, being the most popular script in India today it was a wise choice.

Kudos to whoever designed this tableau.
