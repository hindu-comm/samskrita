I am not interested in sectarian views. Monier Williams's dictionary gives  
  
*garut, t,* m. (said to be fr. 2. *gṛī*),  
the wing of a bird. *— Garut-mat, ān, atī, at* (in  
the Veda only found in connection with *su-parṇa*),  
feathered, winged; swallowing; (*ān*), m. the bird  
Garuḍa;  
  
So apparently the two words are synonymous. My question is does garutmant survive after the Vedas or is it mostly replaced by garuda?
is it a prakritic sound change to replace "tm" by retroflex d?
