James,  
  
 And namaste to you James.  
  
There may well be something special about memorising ***Sanskrit*** texts, but there again there may not...  
  
Were those texts metrical in nature or prose?  
  
How do those Indian brains measure up against scans of those of opera stars, Indian and non-Indian, whose live performances can be quite lengthy viz. Wagners' **Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg** lasts for 4 to 5 hours?  
  
I'm sure my fellow (Anglo-Welsh) countryman Bryn Terfel, who did just that, in 2017, would be proud to help.  
  
There are known side effects to such feats of course, apart from upset neighbours,  
Intensive practice in young learners, who lack normal exposure to social give and take situations, perform poorly on those social intelligence tests, not to mention getting on well with everyday folks.  
  
Regards,
