Dear Sri James-ji,

  

Thanks for the link.

  

You didn't say this benefit to brain comes only from Veda recitation; so lo, come recite Vedas and get the benefit, did you? So never mind even if anyone says the same effect can be produced by some other method.

  

Your report is based on a methodologically done research. Whereas statements about social intelligence side effects are not.

  

There are many stereotypes about geeks and nurds lacking social intelligence etc.

  

Traditionally Vedic scholars lived in their isolated villages where the 'neighbours problem' did not exist.

  

Handloom work, carpentry and many other works produce sounds 'irritating' to the neighbours. Traditionally these professionals too lived in isolated /separated streets/villages of their own.

  

Many modern machine-work workshops produce even more irritating voice.

  

Today, settlement patterns particularly in urban neighbourhoods do not incorporate occupation-wise isolation.

  

Particularly in India, old villages are getting absorbed into expanding cities. Handlooms, carpentry workshops which are usually inside the house setups, machine-work workshops etc., are all surrounding are getting surrounded by normal residences. Temples, masjids etc. use public address systems and their loud sound reaches the ears of the residents of the neighbouring houses.

  

Some neighbours might feel lucky to hear a rock band practice sessions or Indian classical music practice sessions, some might not.

  

Veda memorisers have been doing it for millennia irrespective of the news of its benefits or side effects. Their motivations are not these benefits.

  

Some of them blamed for their social (laukika ) intelligence and are envied for the monetary benefits that social intelligence brings them, Some others pitied for the lack of the same social intelligence (alaukikataa /mugdhataa).

  

They continue their tradition unmindful of any of these.
