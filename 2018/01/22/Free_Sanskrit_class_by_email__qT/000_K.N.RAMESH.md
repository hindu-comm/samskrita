AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE YOUR SAMSKRITAM FREE

==================

  

My name is Krupalu Ogeti. I live in Hyd. I am a full-time volunteer for Samskritam & Gita prachar. I am an engineer with 14+ years of Skt. experience.

  

I have an offer for those with basic Samskrit familiarity & keenness to improve. If you can distinguish between अहं काशी गच्छामि and अहं काशीं गच्छामि; or between सः मां पुस्तकं दत्तवान् and सः मह्यं पुस्तकं दत्तवान्, you are welcome to enroll.

  

You don't have to be comfortable in Spoken Samskritam. No other prerequisite also. Your confidentiality will be maintained.

  

Right now, the no-fee-at-all offer is only through emails. Those interested need to be comfortable in typing in Devanagari. You can enroll by writing a couple of paragraphs about your personal Samskrit journey, preferably in Samskritam (in Devanagari, of course).

  

Once selected, I will send you 10 sentences per week by email. You need to suggest corrections, if any. Those who respond would receive next round.

  

The scheme starts on 03/02/2018, a Saturday.

  

Please email your interest to me at '[okru...@samskritam.net]()'.

  

If you can not email for some reason, you can message your interest by WhatsApp to 7396249650.

  

You can freely circulate this message in all your groups & bring in all your friends. Let us learn together.
