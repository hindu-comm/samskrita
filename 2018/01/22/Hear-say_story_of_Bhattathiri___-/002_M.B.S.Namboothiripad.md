On hearing this reply, the king could understand the wisdom of Bhattathiri. He gave a साष्टाङ्गनमस्कारः to him.

Then Bhattathiri uttered the following shloka as a blessing to him.

अव्यञ्जन: तार्क्ष्यकेतु:

यत्पदम् घटयिष्यति \|

तत्ते भवतु कल्पान्तं

देवनारायण-प्रभो ! \|\|

  

devanarayana is title of all the kings of Ambalapuzha.

Meanings - Let the blessings of krishna (the presiding deity of the temple owneed by the kings family and their para-deveta) be there always till kalpantha (till the world is destroyed by pralaya). As krishna is avyanjana,

he is ever-lasting. So his blessings also will be ever-lasting.

  

If we remove all व्यञ्जनs from तार्क्ष्यकेतु: we getआ+अ+ए+उ: = आयु: . So the pada is आयु: He is blessing the king to live till pralaya.
