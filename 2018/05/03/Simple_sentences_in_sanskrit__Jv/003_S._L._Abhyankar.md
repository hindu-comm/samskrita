I guessसर्वोषां became just a typo in place of सर्वेषाम्

  

Actually it seems Mr. Ramesh tended to use सर्वासाम् becauseसम्पत्तिः is feminine. Two entities connected by षष्ठी विभक्तिः can be of different genders. मातुः पुत्रः or पितुः पुत्रीwould be good examples to remember.

  

Also दीर्घा as adjective ofसम्पत्तिः does not appeal to be good composition. Also धनम् would become a simpler word thanसम्पत्तिः, because there is also a wordसम्पत् which has same meaning.
