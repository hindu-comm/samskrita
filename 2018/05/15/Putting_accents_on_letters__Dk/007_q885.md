Namas tē,

  

If you have Windows 10, you can use this[*keyboard layout*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/129pnDKr3uzL_tBGAUYuVQCP_JNuK0W8_/view?usp=sharing)I created with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. I think it works on Windows 7 as well.

  

It says the language is Estonian. That's just so you can tell it apart from "EN" or "ENG" for English and "SA" or"सं" for Sanskrit. The abbreviation is either "ET" or "EST" so I figure it can stand for English Transliteration or English Sanskrit Transliteration.  
  
It can do IAST as well asISO 15919.

  

Just hold the right \<ALT> and press a letter to get the variant version. For "ś", hold down right \<ALT> and hit "z". Right \<ALT>+"m" is the IAST "ṃ". Hold \<CTRL> and press "m" for ISO 15919 "ṁ". Hold right \<ALT> and press "r" for IAST "ṛ" or \<CTRL>+"r" for "ṝ". For ISO 15919 "r̥", press "r" then hold right \<ALT> and press ".". For "r̥̄" press "r" then hold right \<ALT> and press "." then "-". Likewise for "l̥", press "l" and then right \<ALT>+".". Use right \<ALT>+"g" for "ṅ" and right \<ALT>+"j" for "ñ". The rest are pretty self-explanatory.

  

It cannot do Vēdic accents ("ā́", "í") etc. That would be a lot trickier to implement, unfortunately.

  

Hope this helps.
