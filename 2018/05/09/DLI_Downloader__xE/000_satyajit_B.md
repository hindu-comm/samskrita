Respected scholars,

  

I had used, in the past(6-7 years ago), DLI Downloader. It used to work very smoothly, with wonderful library support.

  

As my laptops malfunctioned, I had to change my laptops, resulting in loss of my DLI downloader setup

  

Now when I try and download DLI downloader, I get different versions (from .23 to 5.9.4), but they do not work. I also installed latest Java (somewhere I read that Java 8 is needed), but the versions simply hang

  

I shall be grateful if I get guidance from the esteemed community.

  

Thanks and regards

  

Satyajita
