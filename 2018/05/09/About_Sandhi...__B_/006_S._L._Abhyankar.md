नमस्ते भट-महोदय !

When I was thinking of करोतौ as द्विवचन of करोत्, I was wondering whether करोत् is संधि of कृ+ओत्.

  

As has been discussed, कृ is certainly relevant for सुँडागम.

  

Isओत् also meaningful and relevant ? That was what I was deliberating upon.

  

If bothकृ and ओत् are relevant and meaningful, thenद्विवचन also becomes justified.

  

Just putting forth loud thinking.
