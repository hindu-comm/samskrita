Can someone please share the lyrics for Jagannatha ashtakam?  
I have already searched Google and founded many variations in each website.  
Our teacher refers to Sanskritdocuments.org, but I was unable to find tgis sloka in that site.  
  
So if someone can share the exact sloka in Sanskrit, it will be really helpful  
  
Thanks in advance  
Sarada.
