In all probability it would be difficult to find a proper Sanskrit word for spectacles because the period during which Sanskrit was in active use - say till the 13 century - spectacles were not known in India or in Europe. Words likeउपनेत्र that one sometimes meets in writings in Indian languages are recent constructs.

  

The Marathi word for 'spectacles' isचाळिशी. It is an old word and has now fallen into disuse. It was coined from the fact that a person starts feeling the need for spectacles around the age of 40, orचाळीस.
