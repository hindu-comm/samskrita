The Telugu word for the drop in reading sight after 40 is chatvaaram. Similar to chaalees of north Indian languages. But in Marathi and hindi the word seems to have become synonymous with spectacles. This did not happen for the word chatvaaram in Telugu.

  

I know the word sulochana for spectacles in Kannada.

  

saaleswaram is interesting.

  

Is it a place name? A place which was known for making these spectacles? Just guessing.
