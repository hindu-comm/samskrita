Dear Members  
  

In the Bhagavadgītā 10.35, Kṛṣṇa speaks of the बृहत्साम mantra of Sāma-veda.  
Does anyone know precisely what this mantra is?  
Can you possibly indicate Sanskrit text?  
Some commentators state that it is 1,235 of the Sama-veda.  
Are there any other opinions?  
  

thanks  

valerio
