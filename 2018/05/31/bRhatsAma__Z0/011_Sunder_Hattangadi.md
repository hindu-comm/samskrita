The samans that are sung in brihati meter comprise the brihatsama.

  

They all are prayers to Indra to attain liberation

  

The esoteric significance is explained in:

(by the renowned Vedic scholar, \[late\] Pandit Satwalekar)

नमस्कार

  

I hope that I have not missed the point here, but I do not believe that the Chandogya verses you refer to (2.14) are referring to a portion of the Sama, but rather to the Sama as a whole.

  

The whole of Book 2 of the Chandogya is a eulogy to साम वेद.

From section 11, the meditations are on the five-fold Sama.  

My understanding is that the 5 parts are a paradigm which is then applied to various aspects of life.

In this case, the movement of the sun.

Others apply to, for instance, the falling of rain, the structure of flesh, procreation etc.

After each, a different adjective is used to describe the Sama when applied to these different areas of life using the five-fold paradigm.

So for the rains, Sama is denoted as वैरूप, for flesh यज्ञायज्ञीय, for procreation वामदेव्य and so on.

  

So here बृहत् does not refer to specific verse or section, but rather the whole of the Sama when meditated upon as the movement of the sun.  

  

Such is my understanding, but this is inferred only and I (sadly) cannot name a guru or aacharya who has taught this to me as such.

So if this is not correct I would be eternally grateful for someone to point out the error in the understanding so that it may be corrected.

  

Kind Regards

Ryan
