Only 3 of \>1000 recensions of Sama Veda are extanṭ.

  

(similarly,only 2 of Rig-, 5 of Yajus-, and some of Atharva- )

Total of \~1180, only \~200 upanishads have surviveḍ, 1 upanishad for each recension .

It is true, other commentators refer to the बृहत्साम citing the phrase त्वामिद्धि, but some त्वामिन्द्र हवामहे

  

Is it possible that in the past there were other versions of सामवेद?  
  

thanks
