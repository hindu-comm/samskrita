Raama,

  

Let us not protest, but communicate.  

  

Words mean different things across different regions.

And then again, Brand names are trade names.

  

So:  

  

 A native of the Indus valley - Indian?

 A native of the Indian sub continent of Bharata Khanda?

 A member of a political party The BJP?  

  

or what?

  

Best,

  

 Taff_Rivers

  

All spelling mistakes are my very own.
