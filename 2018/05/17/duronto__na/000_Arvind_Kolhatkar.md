Dear Group,

  

Following the olderराजधानी and शताब्दि classes of high speed trains connecting distant cities, the latest entrant to this category have been theदुरोन्तो trains. These trains, connecting two distant cities, run non-stop between the two cities.

  

The label, दुरोन्तो. attached to them is somewhat unfortunate. I believe this label is formed from the two Sanskrit wordsदूर and अन्त and the word properly formed by joining them together would have beenदूरान्त.

  

Every linguistic group in India has its peculiar characteristics of pronouncing words. दूरान्त becomes दुरोन्तो in the Bengali-speaking area. These trains started when Mamta Banerjee was the Minister for Railways in 2009.

  

That the speakers of Bengali pronounce this word as दुरोन्तो is no reason why the rest of India should be forced to use this pidginized version of the original Sanskrit word. However, the care for maintaining the purity of Sanskrit in India is so low that all of us are willing to go along with this bastardization without even a murmur of protest!

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
