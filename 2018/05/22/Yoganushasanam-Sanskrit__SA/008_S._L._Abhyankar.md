श्रीमन् रमेश-वर्य !

Whether you proclaim it or not, what you post spreads across the group(s). And whatever is posted with mistakes, becomes disservice to Sanskrit. In the case of mistakes, the question should not be looked at quantitatively. Mistakes cause deterioration of the quality. That is why it becomes disservice.

Also, your enthusiasm is so much, maybe, because, what you do is just copy-paste.

I can offer to proof-read, provided it does not occupy too much of my time.
