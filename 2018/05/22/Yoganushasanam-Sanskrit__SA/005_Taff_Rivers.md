KN,

  

 I have contacted 'Srineet'\*. And found that so far there are 25 sutras commentated upon - YS 1.1 to 1.25.

All are in Devanagari script. And being a somewhat Devanagari challenged, I'll first have to transliteratethem to IAST for them to be useful to me.

Others may find them of interest as written.
