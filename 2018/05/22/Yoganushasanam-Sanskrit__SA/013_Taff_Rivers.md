Ramesh,

  

 You have not cut, copied & pasted from the श्रीनीतः (Srineet) site, which has no such 'decorations'.

What you have done is to cut, copy & paste from your own blog site which does have all that graffiti.

  

In addition, you then post:

  

* 'Thanks Professor. Dr.HN.Bhat ji..*

* **informed Srineet on this**'*

**

while knowing full well who isactually responsible for that *spelling* error in YS 1.1, that has been pointed out to you.
