KN Ramesh et al,

  

 The post by KN. Ramesh is a *retype* of an original work by *Srineed* .

  

As such it not only introduces errors that are not present in the original, but it adds non-devanagari characters such as the asterisks and the underlines.

  

The original and error free text can be is viewed at:



<https://yogasutrasthroughsanskrit.wordpress.com/>

  

Once there, click *Click here for the Sutras along with the audio messages.*

(You may have to scroll to bring it into view.)

  

 Also, avoid accepting unwanted cookies from Wordpress, by ignoring the 'Close and accept' pop-up at the bottom of the screen.

  
Regards,

  

Taff_Rivers
