In the wordpress-blog sighted by Mr. Taff Rivers also, there are mistakes, maybe typos, but some appear to be grammatical also.

For example,

प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पनिद्रास्मृतयः 1'6

the statement of the सूत्रम् looks good, but in पदच्छेदः it is typed प्रमाणविपर्य्य...

Then in तात्पर्य there is the sentence वृत्तीनां ते पञ्चावयवाः अत्र दीयते The subject-wordपञ्चावयवाः is plural, but the verbदीयते is singular.  

  

The non-Devanagari characters in messages of Mr. KN Ramesh, they seem to be his style of decorating the message ! Often there are too many decorations, which can be distractive. Messages without any decorations would become better readable.
