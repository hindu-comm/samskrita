**Introductory course about the nine major schools of philosophy that originated in Ancient India!**

  
As the Indian civilization flourished and settled, people started thinking about the existential questions - who am I? What is the purpose of this world? Why do we exist? A lot of philosophical schools emerged giving answers to these questions. They discussed concepts such as Dharma, Yoga, Karma, Reincarnation, Renunciation, etc. This course deals with a brief summary and comparative study of all the major philosophical streams from ancient India.
