In Paadmapuranam, Sri Mahavishnu says to Brahma  
  
Uthkarsha: kyaapyathae yaistu viswaasaath dravida sruthe: \| sankeerthisaathe mathbhataa: ithi mathbhaktha lakshanam  
  
Those who believe the dravida shruthi (divyaprabandham) and chant them are my devotees. This is the identity for my devotees.  
  
Ithi dravida vedasya uthkarsha: kyaapitho maya \| atha: sruthi apaekyaasyaam prakrista dravida shrutau \| paramaagaramaadathsva nissandeham prajaapathae \|\|  
  
Prajaapathae (Brahma), please take care of my devotees those who comprehended the divyaprabandham by minimising the impact of "samsaarika sukha-dukha" and maximising their divine experience of "bhagavath vaibhavam"  
  
9. In Brahmaandapuraanam, bhagavaan does the following upadesam  
  
shruuyataam uchayathe kinchit rahasyam muni sattama \| (please listen, I am going to a reveal a secret)  
  
kaalaantharethu macchayya bhuta: bhuja naayaka: \| (after a long time, my serpent bed adiseshan)  
  
nirnidhra trintrinee chaptva meshyata: \| (will be born as sleepless tamarind (urangaapuli) tree)  
  
apeestita: naetum draavidataan vedaan athtraivarnikataam kata: \| (I will be born in the fourth class)  
  
mathbhaktaa: satakopaakyo bhavishyaami \|  
(as Satakopan, my devotee)  
  
mama ichchayaa tamirabharanee utharae thatae yathra dhaathra architosmyaham \| (As per my desire, in the north shore of river taamirabharani)  
  
tathramae satakopasya thaenae deshae janma bhavishyathi \| (at azhvaarthirunagari I will be born as Satakopan)  
  
taththaa prakasa ishyaami paramaa: dravida shruthi: \|\| (to enlighten the supreme dravida shruthi - note here it says to enlighten the dravida shruthi which is already in existence and not creating it as new)  
  
Further in Brahmaandapuraanam, perumal expresses His displeasure in anger  
  
draavidaamnaayam niratham yo nindhathi sudhirmathi: \*brahma pralaya paryantham\* \*kumbipaakesa\* machyathe \*swamaathu: vyabhichaarokthou doshahaa\* parikeerthitha:  
sadosho dravidaamnaaya dhooshnaepi bhaveth dhruvam  
  
Those who disregard the dravida veda as secondary because of its tamil language  
will get kumbhipaaka narakam till the end of Brahma's life and also get to treat at par to those who committed the sin of questioning their mothers integrity.  
  
10. In Sri Vishnu dharmam, bhagavaan says those who think the supreme dravida veda as an ordinary tamil song, they will get rouravaadhi narakam till the end of brahma kalpakam period.  
  
Hence these are the pramaanams from various puranams, samhitaas which highlight the glories of nammazhvar who enlightened the veda.  
  
Since bhagavaan Himself took birth as Nammazhvaar, one should \*not\* think that Nammazhvar was just born in the low fourth caste, or he just sung in tamil language, or he is not a rishi or muni to enlighten the vedas etc.  
  
Nammazhvar is incarnation of bhagavaan with the amsam of vishvaksenar and spent 32 years under tamarind tree, which is none other than Adiseshan and Nammazhvar enlightened the veda giving the rahasya thrayam to Naathamuni, thus becoming the aacharyan and prapannajana kootasthar, taking an unique place connecting with Lakshminathan, Piraati and Vishwaksenar from Nithiya vidhuthi and with Naathamuni etc in Leela vibhuthi in the aacharya guru parampara lineage.
