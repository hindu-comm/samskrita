Murthy,

  

 There is a difference between verbal expressions and verb forms.

  

A verbal*expression*would be something like 'The student made the teacher very annoyed'.

or  

'The student caused the teacher to be very annoyed.  

  

Whereas a causative form of the verb*annoyed*would do no more than save a single word, from the expression 'made annoyed'.

  

Sanskrit doesn't have to use a causative*form*, it could simply take the trouble to use the Sanskrit verb 'cause' to express exactly the same idea.

  

But English is flexible, how about 'The student bothered the teacher'.

  

Where*bother*suggests**causing**trouble or weariness or repeatedly interrupting in the midst of pressing duties?  

  

 On the subject of causatives, Walter Harding Maurer, in his 'The Sanskrit Language' has 'Lesson Twenty-Eight' with this topic. There he says 'Modern English has only half a dozen or so causative verbs inherited from Old English'.  

I only have his paper book, so unfortunately I can't copy & paste content. Anyway those half dozen or so aren't really helpful. e.g. 'bait cause to bite' unless you go fishing!

  

Regards,
