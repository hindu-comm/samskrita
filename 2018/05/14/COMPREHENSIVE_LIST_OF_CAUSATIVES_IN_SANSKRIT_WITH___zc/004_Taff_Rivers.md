Dr,

  

 Thanks,

  

*  * The English definitionis actually to be found in *The Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar,*

   not*The Oxford English Dictionary of Style* as I wrote*, (*which in turn is properly titled *The Oxford Guide to Style!)*.

  

The Gremlins were the causatives of the above.

  

best,
