Dr Bhat has already explained this To clarify it even further, theश्लोक is a prayer toसवितृ the Sun-god and he is also called नारायण. He is described as adorned byकेयूर arm-bracelet, मकरकुण्डल ear-ornament in the shape of a crocodile, किरीट crown and हार garland. The one having a केयूर is.केयूरवत्, of which the nominative case singular isकेयूरवान् . Similarly forमकरकुण्डलवान् किरीटी हारी.

  

A personal recollection. As a small boy, my grandfather had taught us the exercise ofसूर्यनमस्कार, which we did in the morning. Our exercise started with the recitation of this श्लोक.
