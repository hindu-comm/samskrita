Namastey

  

॥ ॐ ध्येयः सदा सवित्र मण्डल मध्यवर्ती नारायण सरसिजा सनसन्नि विष्टः  
केयूरवान मकरकुण्डलवान किरीटी हारी हिरण्मय वपुर धृतशंख चक्रः ॥  

  

In this slokam, what form of word is "keYuravaan", "Makarakundalavaan"
"kiritee haaree" - is this the second form of vibhakti? It seems to address to Lord Naarayana. So trying to understand, whether this terms in the sloka are also in Noun form and if so in which case ending? 

  

thanks
