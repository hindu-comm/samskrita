First of all, please make corrections to the text of the verse you have as per the version provided by Dr H N Bhat. If you have been reciting tis already, please make corrections to your recitation by repeatedly reciting the correct version.

  

प्रथमा विभक्तिः, एकवचनम् here might have been found as strange by you because you might have expectedसंबोधन प्रथमा विभक्तिः or द्वितीया विभक्तिः which is found in many such s'lokas.

  

Here, the verb is ध्येयः = has/ needs / deserves to be meditated on.
