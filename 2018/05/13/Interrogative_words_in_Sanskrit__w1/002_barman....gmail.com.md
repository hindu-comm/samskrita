Dear Raj Man,  
More another interrogative words are seen in Sanskrit such as Kwa (where), Kimu (used in interrogation), karhi (when) etc.

In the English grammar; which, when, why, where and others interrogative words are called Wh-words. Now in the Sanskrit as like as English grammar we may call allinterrogative words as a "ka-Sabdah."

Thank you.
