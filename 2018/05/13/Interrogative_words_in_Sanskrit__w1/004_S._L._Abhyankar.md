All the responses are good. May I also add =>

-   One makes interrogative sentences without interrogatives also. In
    English grammar the rule is to put the verb at the beginning of the
    sentence, e.g. Affirmative :- It is so. Interrogative :- Is it so ? -   In Sanskrit अपि at the beginning of the sentence makes it
    interrogative, e.g. सः गच्छति \| => अपि गच्छति सः ? -   Often interrogative can be understood by tone. सः गच्छति खलु \| सः
    गच्छति खलु ?
