Namastey,

  

 Is their a ordered list of all interrogative words in Sanskrit? I heard that there are Seven interrogative words broadly, as follows. Is this correct?

  

Kutra - Where?

Kadaa - When?

Katham - How?

Kathi - How many?

Kutaha - From where?

Kimartham - Why? what for?

Kim - This declines in many forms such as kEna, kaa, kaha etc in all 3 lingas, 7 Vibhaktis, 3 vachanas and meaning varies.

  

Is this categorization right? Where do words such as kaani, kEna, Kiyat, Kasyai, Kaabhyaha, kaihi, kaabhyaam etc fall under this categorization?

  

Thanks for guidance.
