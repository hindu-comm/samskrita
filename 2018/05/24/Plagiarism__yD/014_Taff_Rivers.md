Sunder,

  

 There would seem to be a relevant verb, even an adjective, though not a specific noun:

  

**dūṣaya**

• Nom. P. °yati (ep. also °te) to corrupt, spoil, contaminate, vitiate (of moral corruption also doṣayati, see 2. duṣ), AV. Mn. MBh. Kāv. &c.

• to dishonour or violate (a woman), Mn. viii, 364, MBh. &c.

• (astrol.) to cause evil or misfortune, Var.

• to adulterate, **falsify**, MBh. xiii, 1683.

• to object, refute, disprove, blame, ib. Kathas. &c.

• to retract or break (vācam, one's word), MBh. xii, 7256.

• to find fault with, accuse, MBh. R.

• (paras-param, each other), Pañc. 450/451.

• to offend, hurt, injure (gen.), R. ii, 74, 3, MBh. iv, 2228 &c. \[489,1\]

  

  

**brahma-duṣaka**

• mfn. **falsifying** the Vedic texts, Hcat. \[738,3\]

  

  

Hope this helps.
