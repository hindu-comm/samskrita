> Dear Anand,

  
It depends on what you mean by Reverse Plagiarism.  
  
Did you mean interpolation?  
In which case, the Sanskrit equivalent is prakshepaप्रक्षेप  
  
Or were you implying ghostwriting?  
In which, the closest equivalent that comes to my mind ischadma lekhanamछद्म लेखनम्or pracchanna lekhanamप्रच्छन्न लेखनम्  
  
Hope this helps,

M
