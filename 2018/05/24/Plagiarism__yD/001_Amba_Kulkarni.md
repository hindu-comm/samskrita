While I do not know the Sanskrit word for Plagiarism,

I came across the following in  

Anandvardhana in Dhvanyaaloka, which has some resemblance with Plagiarism.  
  
संवादो ह्यन्यसादृश्यं तत्पुनः प्रतिबिंबवत् \|  
आलेख्याकारवत् तुल्यदेहिवच्च शरीरिणाम् ॥ १२॥  
तत्र पूर्वमनन्यात्म तुच्छात्म तदनन्तरम् \|  
तृतीयं तु प्रसिद्धात्म नान्यसाम्यं त्यजेत्कविः ॥ १३॥  
  
This is in the 4th chapter.  
  

Ingalls translates this as:  
  
A coincidence is a similarity to something else. As with persons, it may be like one's  
mirror image, or like one's portrait, or like the body \[of a person\] which resembles ones'  
own.  
  
Of these the poet should avoid the first, which has no soul of its own, and the next,  
which has a worthless soul; but not the third, which has a soul indeed, although it is like  
something else.
