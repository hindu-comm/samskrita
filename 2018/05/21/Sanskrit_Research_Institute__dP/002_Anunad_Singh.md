I found the OCR very useful especially for OCRing one-two pages of Google books or other archives. In Ubuntu, I take a snapshot and paste the clipboard in the input box of the OCR and get the equivalent text within a minute or two.  
  

But it seems that the OCR is **not** working (or hanging) with Tesseract as the OCR engine.
