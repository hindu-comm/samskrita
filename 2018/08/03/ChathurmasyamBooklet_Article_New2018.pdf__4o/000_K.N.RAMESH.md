A booklet on CHATURMASYAM containing article in Tamil by Sri Anantanandendra Swamigal, with English translation by me, was released by Veda Rakshana Nidhi Trust two days ago at Kanchi Srimatham by Pujya Sri Sankaracharya Swamigal.

The booklet is attached.

The booklet is now hosted in the[kamakoti.org](http://kamakoti.org/)website under: <http://kamakoti.org/kamakoti/books/Chathurmasyam.pdf>.
