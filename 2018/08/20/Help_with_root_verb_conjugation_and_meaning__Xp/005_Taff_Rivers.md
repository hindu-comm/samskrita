Sunder,

  

 The famous Monier Williams has this:

  

vi-√ cakṣ  
 • Ā. -caṣṭe (Ved. inf. -cakṣe), to appear, shine, ṚV.  
 • to see distinctly, view, look at, perceive, regard, ṚV. AV. BhP.  
 • to make manifest, show, ṚV.  
 • to proclaim, announce, tell, Br. MBh. BhP.: Caus. -cakṣayati, to cause to see distinctly, make clear, ṚV.  
 • to proclaim, tell, GopBr. \[958,2\]

  

  

vicaṣṭe is the gerund.  

  

 hope this helps,
