"The verb forms and the prakriya on this interface have been pulled from the[prakriyāpradarśinī API](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/prakriya)that"s based on the[SanskritVerb](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb)project, also accessible at[this frontend](https://avinashvarna.github.io/prakriya/). We are thankful to the creators and the developers of these projects - notably Dr. Dhaval Patel, Dr. Shivakumari Katuri and Mr. Avinash Varna - for letting us use these forms on [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com).
