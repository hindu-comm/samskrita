This is a great resource for Panini's student. What is the source of the data and who is maintaining this site.

For example screenshot of a Dhatu is shown below - many such discrepancies are found on it.

1\. This sites shows as ज्व॑रँ॑ रोगे सवरितेत् परस्मैपद धातु - This makes the Dhatu उभयपद which is not the case, because there was only one form listed

2\. Ramlal Kapoor book lists asज्वरँ रोगे॑ - under उदात्ता परस्मैपद - this is परस्मैपद धातु alone. आत्मनेपद form will not be there.

  

Which one is right?

Thanks for your help
