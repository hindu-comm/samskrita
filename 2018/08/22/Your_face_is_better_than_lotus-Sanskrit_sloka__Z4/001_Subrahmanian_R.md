What I have read is:

King Bhoja was trying to locate Kavi Kalidas. So he announced a prize for completing the verse:

कुसुमे कुसुमोस्पत्ति: श्रूयते च न दृश्यते ।

Kalidasa was staying in the residence of an 'entertainer' lady.

She wrote the sentence on the wall and was confident that it would attract the eyes of Kalidasa.

Kalidasa could not resist the temptation of completing the poem.

He added:

बाले तव मुखाम्बोजे नयन इन्दीवरद्वयम् ॥

She immediately wrote it in a palm leaf and took it with her.

But, the king immediately recognized that it is not her creation. The first word gave her out.

बाले - Obviously, it is by a man to a girl -

She admitted to have thrown a large stone on the head of Kalidasa before leaving for the Court.

The king was very anxious of getting his own work edited or approved by Kalidasa. He went there and noticed that Kalidasa was alive.

He read out the Champu Ramayana and got that edited. By the time he reached the last chapter, Kalidasa breathed his last

and hence Bhoja's work was incomplete.

Probably (if my memory is right) this was in the introduction of Kuvalayananda of Appayya Dikshitar.
