Dear list members,

  

The first verse of the Śivatāṇḍavastotram is:

  

jaṭāṭavīgalajjalapravāhapāvitasthale

  

gale 'valambya lambitāṁ bhujaṅgatuṅgamālikām \|

  

ḍamaḍḍamaḍḍamaḍḍamanninādavaḍḍamarvayam

  

cakāra caṇḍatāṇḍavaṁ tanotu naḥ śivaḥ śivam \|\|

  

I"m having some trouble parsing the third line:

ḍamaḍḍamaḍḍamaḍḍamanninādavaḍḍamarvayam

  

Is that two words, joined by sandhi, a long compound and ayam where ayam is the personal pronoun from

ḍamaḍḍamaḍḍamaḍḍamanninādavaḍḍamaru ayam

  

  

or is it one long compound ending in the verb aya and in the accusative case.

ḍamaḍ-ḍamaḍ-ḍamaḍ-ḍaman-nināda-vaḍ-ḍamarv-ayam

  

or is it something else?

  

Any help would be appreciated,

Harry Spier
