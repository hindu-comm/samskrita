Hari Om dear group members,

  

I'm looking for a correct version of the Hanuman Chalisa - Sanskrit text & Recording with proper chanting.

  

I know there is a lot of material out there on youtube and other places but not sure which one we can take as accurate.

  

Any recommendations would be highly appreciated.

  

-Vivek
