Dear list members

  

I saw this amazing mandala style yantra of ‘Sudarshananatha-ji’ with a ‘shodashabhuja’ (16-armed) form of Srinatha-ji, the presiding deity of Nathadwara temple frequented by Pushti-Margi-s, at a Gujarati home in Mumbai today. I have seen many paintings of Srinatha-ji I don’t recall seeing 16-armed Srinathaji ever before today. There are two triangles behind and a lotus below Srinatha-ji. He isencircled by mantras & ‘sudarshana’ chakra in the form of flames of fire.

  

Can anybody give any details about ‘Sudarshananatha-ji’or the
‘shodashabhuja’ form of Srinatha-ji?
