नमस्तेसुनीता  

उपसर्ग नि = full, complete  

धातु ध्यै is in the desiderative form :  

<http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%88&lang=sans&action=Search>  

  

In translation, I would venture "The complete wish for (Union in) contemplation."

Regards

Ryan
