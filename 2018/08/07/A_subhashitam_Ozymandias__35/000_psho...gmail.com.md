क्व गताः पृथिवीपालाः ससैन्यबलवाहनाः

वियोगसाक्षिणी येषां भूमिरद्यापि तिष्ठति

  

अन्वयः

ससैन्यबलवाहनाः पृथिवीपालाः क्व गताः । येषां वियोगसाक्षिणी भूमिः अद्य अपि तिष्ठति॥

Loose translation:  
  

> Where gone are those kings with their mighty armies and chariots? > Earth, a witness to their departure, remains even today.

  
A poem (Ozymandias) by P.B.Shelley explores a similar theme:  



> I met a traveler from an antique land  
> Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desert... near them, on the sand,  
> Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;  
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'  
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.

  
Let me quote from the wiki entry of this poem (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias>) because I don't think I can do a better job:  
  

> ...Poem(s) explore the fate of history and the ravages of time: even > the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their > legacies fated to decay into oblivion.... A central theme of > "Ozymandias" is the inevitable decline of leaders of empires and their > pretensions to greatness.
