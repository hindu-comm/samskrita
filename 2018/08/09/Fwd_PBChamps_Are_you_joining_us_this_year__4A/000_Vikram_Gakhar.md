Dear #PBChamps,

  

Hello, again! We are back with our annual One Day, One Story campaign -- now in its seventh year, thanks to the commitment and support of all of you. We hope to see your name on this year's list of #PBChamps too.

  

As you know, International Literacy Day is on September 8, which is a Saturday.

  

This year's book is [A Cloud of Trash](https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/11166-a-cloud-of-trash), written by Karanjeet Kaur, and illustrated by Bhavana Vyas Vipparthi. It’s a story about a little girl called Cheekoo, who has a cloud of trash hanging over her head. This makes her very, very unhappy, and as we follow her story, we learn a little more about trash, and about keeping our surroundings clean.

  

The story works well for children across different age and reading levels, and introduces themes like waste management, littering, reuse and recycling, and social responsibility. You could enact it, if you like, or get children to imagine what a cloud of trash could look like. We would love for you to use this story in creative ways – read, narrate, enact… it’s your session to conduct.

  

5700+ champions joined us last year to introduce [Kottavi Raja and his Sleepy Kingdom](https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/16054-kottavi-raja-and-his-sleepy-kingdom) to children across India. Can’t wait to see how many Champions join us this year!

  

Here's the form to register: [https://goo.gl/BPtjYZ](https://goo.gl/BPtjYZ)

  

Spread the word! Share this link with your friends and family and ask them to join you this year: [https://goo.gl/472Pso](https://goo.gl/472Pso)

  

Support the event! We are using the Donate-a-Book platform to help us get more books to Champions. It would be great if you could share this campaign in your own network: [https://goo.gl/WeUmZB](https://goo.gl/WeUmZB)

  

Really looking forward to seeing your names on this year's registration list. As always, thank you for being such awesome #PBChamps -- we couldn’t do this without you!

  

All the best,

  

Sangeeta
