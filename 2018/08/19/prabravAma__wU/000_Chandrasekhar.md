Hi all!

  

NamaskArams.  

  

i) The name शङ्कर can be explained as "शं करोति इति शङ्कर" which means one who does brings about peace.  

  

ii) How does one expand the word "प्रब्रवाम" to refer Lord Brahma? Brahma is "adi kavi" and always speaks sweet words. Can something be extracted along these lines?

  

Thanks.

Chandrasekhar.
