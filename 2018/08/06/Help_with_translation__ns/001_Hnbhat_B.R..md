I don't think Purandaradasa wrote his kritis in Sanskrit, where this kriti is completely in Sanskrit and by Muthuswamy Dikshitar. The translation given in the site is correct and prabra does no mean anything in Sanskrit. There seems typo error in translation and the translator has translated prabravaamaadivandita as it is "***Whose feet are worshipped by Prabra Vaama etc."***

***  
***I could think of any correction or meaning for prabravaama. The rest is correct.
