ब्रू : ब्रूञ् व्यक्तायां वाचि - उ.प

  

ब्रवाम - लोट् - उत्तम पुरुष बहु वचनम् inपरस्मै पदी usage

  

प्रब्रवाम - Let us utter sweet words - Here in this context - the legs which are worshipped by our sweet words .  

  

Probably Dikshitar has borrowed the word from veda as it is which is a very common characteristic of his kritis ( mostly the words from veda or LS are used )

  

Please see page no. 95 in the madhyanhika upasthaana portion for the meaning here:

Why ब्रू : in लिट् लुट् लृट् - takes entirely different forms such as उवाच वक्ता वक्ष्यति respectively unlike other dhatus which are almost similar...?
