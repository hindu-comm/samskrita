नमस्ते श्रीमन् वलेर्यो विर्जिनी-महोदय !

सुखेनास्म्यहम् !

I agree that dictionary-meanings are always not appropriate to the context.

Sinceसांकेत्यम् means agreement, I would take it to mean "mindfully"

Proceeding further

पारिहास्यं = casually, or playfully

स्तोभं = respectfully (becauseस्तुभ् I. 1 P (स्तोभति)**1**To praise.**-2**To celebrate, extol, worship)

हेलनम् = contemptuously (becauseहेलनम् / ना 1 Disregarding, slighting, contempt, insulting.**-2**Sporting amorously, wanton dalliance.)

विदुः = They know that

वैकुण्ठ-नाम-ग्रहणम् = taking / uttering name ofवैकुण्ठ

(is)

अशेषाघ-हरं =अशेष-अघ-हरं = remover of sin non-remnant

By this, the translation becomes "They know that, whether takenmindfully, casually, respectfully or contemptuously, uttering name of वैकुण्ठ is remover of sin non-remnant."

  

By the wayवैकुण्ठ*a.*Unassailable (दुर्धर्ष); इन्द्रो वैकुण्ठो$पराजिता सेनेति वा अहमेतमुपास Bṛi. Up.2.1.6.

Alsoवैकुण्ठः 1 An epithet of Viṣṇu; मन्दं जहास वैकुण्ठो मोहयन्निव मायया Bhāg.1.8.44.

It is derived from वि+कुण्ठ् whereकुण्ठ् 1 P. (कुण्ठति, कुण्ठित)**1**To be blunted or dulled.**-2**To be lame or mutilated.**-3**To be dull or stupid, be idle.**-4**To loosen. So वैकुण्ठः means one who has no negativities, hence one who is omnipotent

कुण्ठ् is also used in the sense of "to obstruct" Soवैकुण्ठः means one who faces no obstruction anytime, anywhere, so, one who is omnipresent and omniscient.  

Soवैकुण्ठः means one whois omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient.
