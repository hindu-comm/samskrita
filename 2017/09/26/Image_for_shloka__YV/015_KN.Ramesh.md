Thanks Sunder ji...

So forनानालंकारयुक्तंit is left to the individual to think of the alankara as he feels...

  

>\>Datura flowers..

<http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Datura.html>  

  

BTW , it is written here<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Puja>that one should not use champaka flower for Shiva.

  

But Adishankara bhagavtapada in his Shiva maanasa pooja tells jaati champaka bilva patra racitam...

Is this champaka flower what bhagavat pada referring different..??
