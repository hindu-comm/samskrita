@Ravi

  

I don't have Mudgal Purana.

  

@all

  

Do see the newer JARs and they will transliterate from all Indian Languages to All Others and all the other formats.

  

Still looking out for volunteer input who can find errors in transliteration like Bangla v will generate a Dabba\[\].

  

Thanks and regards.
