Re. Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary.  
  
 I **Open ** *indicTools-dictionary.jar -* a window appears entitled *Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary.*  
  
 I click **Enter**, with 'shiva, shakkti' in the input box - but nothing happens, the large *output box remains empty.  
  
  
*I am running *Windows Pro* on a desktop PC.*  
*I have downloaded the three '2 days ago' jar files, indicTools-transliterator, indicTools-sandhi, and indicTools-dictionary,  
  
Please advise,
