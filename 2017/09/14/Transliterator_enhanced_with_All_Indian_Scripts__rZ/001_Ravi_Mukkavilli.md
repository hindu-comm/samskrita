Namaste Chetanji,

  
Amazing effort, to create such tools, which are easy to use. I will try out all three of those.

Apart from this, I'm looking for Mudgala Puranam with hindi translation, I found a PDF in [archive.org](http://archive.org) but scan quality is bad in few pages.

  

Regards,

Ravi Mukkavilli
