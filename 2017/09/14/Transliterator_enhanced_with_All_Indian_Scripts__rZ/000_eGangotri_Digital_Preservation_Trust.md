Dear All:  
  
I have done several enhancements to my Transliterator.  
  
Most important is speed streamlining and now larger texts are getting processed in very low time.  
  
All Indian Scripts have been introduced but I am not sure how the output is correct.  
  
For every Language I will be happy to work with volunteers who can point the errors. I may introduce Tibetan/Simhala/Thai etc if these follow the same pattern as Other Indic Language Tools.  
  
I have also moved my Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary under the indicTools umbrella.  
  
All jars and screen shots can be downloaded from below.
