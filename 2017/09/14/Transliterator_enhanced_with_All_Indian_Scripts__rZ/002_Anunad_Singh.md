I too have worked on transliteration of Brahmi derived scripts and  
developed a javascript based tool for it. I feel that these tools will  
prove to be much useful if -  
  
1) it is extended to Burmese, Thai, Khmer, Javanese and other east  
asian scripts,  
  
2) As there is lack of one-to-one mapping for some of the varNas of  
some of the scripts, some solution should be agreed. For example, what  
should be done for Tamil \<==>Devanagari transliteration?  
  
3) Such tools should come in a variety of shades- those that  
transliterate a given webpage directly into script of one's choice,  
should also be developed.  
  
4) Some of the transliteration tools can have option to 'translate'  
some most common words of the source language too. (into which  
language?)
