Dear Scholars,

Thanks for the information.

Let us assume that Gotra (गोत्र) stands for lineage. If I say my Gotra is Baradwaja, it means I belong to Rishi Baradwaga lineage and my ancestors are some how connected to Rishi Baradwaga.

There are two cases: Gotra is not known (i.e. forgotten) and the second one Gotra does not exist.

  

**Case 1:** Gotra is not known. That means I have forgotten my Gotra. Suppose that I belong to Baradwaja Gotra, I forgotten my Gotra, then I can be considered as Kashyapa Gotra. It means some how I/my ancestors belonged to one or other Rishis lineage. Here no problem. My Genes in blood are matching with one or other of the ancient Rishis. One more instance is the case of conversion. Suppose 4 generations back, my great grand fathers were converted from Hindu to Non-Hindu religion. Now if I converte back to Hindu, my Gotra can be considered as Kashyapa, since I do not know the Gotra of my great grand fathers. But, some how my roots are connected to the ancient Rishi. In both the instances, Gotra is known, but which Gotra is not known. Hence attaching kashyapa Gotra to me not an issue.

  

**Case 2:** Gotra does not exist: I am a foreigner and a Non-Hindu. Came to India. And converted to Hinduism. In this case, no way my Genes are connected to any one of the ancient Rishis. Still, am I considered Kashyapa Gotra? In the replies provided, it is mentioned that Kasyapa Gotra is to considered, when Gotra is not known (i.e., Gotra exist, but which Gotra is not known). What should be done in case of Gotra does not exist as in this second case.

  

Regards
