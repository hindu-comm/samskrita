Prajaah sarvaah means all people.

  

Gotra is the belief / tradition of "the Hindus". ' Sarvaah prajaah kas'yapasambhavaah' is also their belief / tradition. Their belief /tradition is not that only those belonging to or born into "Hinduism" are Kas"yapasambhavaah. Their belief is that all creatures are born from Kas"yapa. While not being a Hindu , one does not know / does not consider that one is born of Kas"yapa. But once converted to Hinduism, he comes to know that he is born of Kas"yapa.

  

In any ritual there is no portion where the Purohit , without making the person say " I, belonging to such and such gotra", mentions the gotra, all by himself. So, gotra is based on the belief of the person performing the ritual. Once a person gets converted to Hinduism, he comes to know / believe that he is Kas"yapasambhava.

  

Thus it is not wrong to say that the gotra of a person getting converted to Hinduism is of Kas"yapa gotra.
