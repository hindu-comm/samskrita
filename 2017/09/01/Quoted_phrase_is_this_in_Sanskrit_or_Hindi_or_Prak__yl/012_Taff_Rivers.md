Dr,  
  
 Your suggestion to retro fit one language upon another, is but to mask the search for truth of the material kind. Akin to rewriting history!  
  
What is needed here, as the basis for discussion (or speculation!) is an actual text scan of the Buddhist sūtra, *Kāraṇḍavyūha*, in all its manuscriptal glory.  
  
In my opinion, of much more historical relevance than Greek mythologies of siren ladies, is that the *Kāraṇḍavyūha*, contains the earliest manuscriptal occurrence of the mantra ***Om Mani Padme Hum***.  
  
A review of the original material, by those who know these things, as opp. to the multitudes that but know *of* them, is what would be the real gem, value wise.  
  
Regards,
