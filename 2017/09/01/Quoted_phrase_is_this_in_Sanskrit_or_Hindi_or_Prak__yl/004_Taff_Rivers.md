Brian,  
  
As it turns out, in both its literal and allegorical senses, the phrase *ko pāraga*, is also to be found in classical Saṃskṛta.  
  
From the Monier-Williams:  
  
ko, from ka.  
 ka is often connected with a demonstrative pron. (e.g. ko\_'yam_āyāti, who comes here?)

pāraga  
 • mf(ā)n. going to the opposite shore, crossing over, MBh. R.  
 page 619, col 2.  
  
Taff Rivers.  
  
 Nobody has ever come back from that opposite shore to tell the tale.
