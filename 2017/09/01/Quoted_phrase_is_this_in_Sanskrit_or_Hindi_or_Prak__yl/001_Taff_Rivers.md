Brian,  
  
 A reality check, reveals that poetic license has been taken by a group of (English) Christian folk singers from Norfolk, UK.  
  
Koi is a Japanese carp and Paraga is a beach in Greece, but I think something got lost in the translation.  
  
You don't say what those 'popular sources' of yours, are, but:  
  
 <http://www.koiparaga.co.uk/>  
  
Koi Paraga, translated as 'Anyone for the Other Shore?', are ***a contemporary folk quartet***, crafting songs of deep thought and heartfelt sincerity. A singer-songwriter, virtuoso guitarist, double bassist and vocal gymnast-cum-percussionist have joined forces in search of a new shore and invite you on their journey.  
  
Anyway, you can always email the singer-songwriter person and ask him who did the 'translation'.  
  
A search reveals that much the same assumption regarding origin, was asked in a (Christian) religious group, here in the UK, over ten years back.
