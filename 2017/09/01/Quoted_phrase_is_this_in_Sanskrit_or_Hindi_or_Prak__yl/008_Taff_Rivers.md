Brian,  
  
 *Pali*, is a generic term for vernacular Indic languages.  
Even the spelling of the name is open to speculation.  
  
As to whether Pali was a specific language is not known. There is no substantiated work of Pali grammar.  
Any such relationship to Saṃskṛta, classical or Vedic, is pure speculation.  
  
Anyway, the complete phrase as reported in the Latin script, is linguistically of the reflexive kind, not the accusative.  
  
What's more, Buddhism is a religion, and has, *terminology* rather than *grammar*.  
  
As such, it is always subject to the influence of the various prevailing authorities' taking into account their moral or political sensitivities.  
  
As an example from Christianity, where the earliest writings of Jesus's own brother makes no references to either *virgin birth* or *crucifixion*.  
The original biblical texts simply referring to a 'maiden' or 'unmarried woman'.  
  
Hardly a non-issue, given the subject matter!
