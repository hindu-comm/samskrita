Dr. Bhat, thanks also for your view on this.

  

I did have the idea that this might be in Hindi. Google Translate helped confirm the possibility for me.

  

Yet the scripture seems to exist in Sanskrit -- though not in Pali, that I have found at least -- in a collection in Nepal:

And I am aware that texts got translated from Pali to Sanskrit. Perhaps that happened here.

  

Does anyone know how one might access the actual text of the
*Kāraṇḍavyūha*?

  

Brian
