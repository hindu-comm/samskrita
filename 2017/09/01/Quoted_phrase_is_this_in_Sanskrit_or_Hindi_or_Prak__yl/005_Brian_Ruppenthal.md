Taff and all,

  

Thanks again.

  

I sort of knew of this too, but was confused on finding an odd sandhi treatment.

  

Visarga before the consonant (p in this case) should remain unchanged, right?

  

<https://ubcsanskrit.ca/lesson3/sandhicharts.html#visarga>  

  

I think I have noticed, though, that Pali tends to 'overuse' the 'o' ending, as it were, creating a sandhi effect when none would happen in Sanskrit. so this phrase is perhaps in Pali?

  

Brian
