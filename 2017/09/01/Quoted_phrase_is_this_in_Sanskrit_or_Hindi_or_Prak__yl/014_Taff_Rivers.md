Brian,  
  
==>Does anyone know how one might access the actual text of the
*Kāraṇḍavyūha*?\<==  
  
There is no such thing as an 'actual text of the *Kāraṇḍavyūha*'.  
  
For a good old fashioned reality check, look no further that here: 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li_Canon#The_earliest_books_of_the_Pali_Canon>  
Time, is the enemy of us all.  
  
 Scroll down to **Texts - Manuscripts  
  
**There you will discover:  
 "The climate of Theravāda countries is not conducive to the survival of manuscripts. Apart from brief quotations in inscriptions and a two-page fragment from the eighth or ninth century found in Nepal, the oldest manuscripts known are from late in the fifteenth century,\[53\] and there is not very much from before the eighteenth.\[54\]"  
  
Even so, you will need a large bookcase, not to mention a fat wallet. There were on-line versions, but copyright laws prevailed...  
  
Taff Rivers,  
  
R & D person, retd.
