Friends,

  

I am in need of verifying a quote attributed, in popular works, to the Buddha. Can anyone help?

  

The phrase in popular sources is shown as 'Koi paraga' or 'Koiparaga.'
It gets translated as "Is there anyone for the Other Shore?," with the Buddha as orator, as a supreme boatman.

  

I am supposing this would be written asको ई पारग (ko ī pāraga) .But who knows?

  

The grammar escapes me. Also, I can't identify the language. Not Pali, nor Sanskrit?

  

Thanks in advance,

  

Brian
