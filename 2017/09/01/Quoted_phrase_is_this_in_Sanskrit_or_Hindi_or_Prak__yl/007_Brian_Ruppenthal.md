Taff and all, if you do not mind further fuss about this particular quote...

  

I also found myself surprised by a lack of ending on the word pāraga.
In the accusative case, 'to the Other Shore,' we'd expect pāragam. In the dative, 'for the Other Shore,' pāragāya.

  

Do you have any guesses, or insights perhaps, on that matter? Is this somehow a non-issue?

  

Brian
