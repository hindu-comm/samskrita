Irene, and anyone else interested...

  

Most interesting to have some version of the*Kāraṇḍavyūha*text. 

  

It would take some time to actually locate anything in it of course. I gave it a first cursory try, but then gave up. 

  

One doubts there will be an electronic version anywhere available. And producing such a version myself would take quite a while.

  

I also noticed that some of the text in it is in, I think, Old Bengali font? -- and language too I suppose.

  

Anyway, thanks for providing this interesting link.

  

Brian
