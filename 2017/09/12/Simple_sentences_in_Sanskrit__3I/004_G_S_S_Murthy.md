May I humbly suggest Rameshji and perhaps the administrator of this group too that such lessons are best posted on a blog and of course Rameshji could suggest in this forum that those interested may read his regular blog. I believe that this forum is for elucidation and clarification of doubts in all aspects associated with Sanskrit.

Regards,

Murthy
