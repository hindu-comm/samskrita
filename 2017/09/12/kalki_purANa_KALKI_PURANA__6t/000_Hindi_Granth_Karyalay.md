The Kalki Purana is a prophetic text in Sanskrit that details the life and times of Kalki, the tenth and final of the Dashavatara (the ten Avatars) of Lord Vishnu.

  

It is considered an Upa-Purana or Lesser Purana. Among the Upa-Puranas, the Kalki Purana is the most widely respected. It is derived from passages taken directly from the 18 Major Puranas, including the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata Purana ascribed to Vyasa.

  

As a prophetic work, the Kalki Purana writes details about events believed to occur in the future. The work primarily describes the onset and exponential increase of evil and sin on the earth during the Kali Yuga, and the life of Kalki, who is said to bring an end to the darkness of the Kali Yuga, destroying evil and sin, and beginning a new yuga (age) of sinlessness and peace known as the Satya Yuga.

  

Both the Hindi and English translations have been done by Dr Pushpa Gupta, a Professor of Sanskrit at Delhi University.

  

These books are welcome additions to our large collection of Puranas translated into Hindi/English.

  

We are delighted to make these books available at our bookstore and through mail order.
