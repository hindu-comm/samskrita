Acarya Pujyapada, the Digambara monk and pioneering Sanskrit grammarian, lived in the 6th century of the Common Era. Apart from his deep scholarship and mastery of the Jain doctrine, Pujyapada was a mystic and yogi who wrote from his spiritual experiences.

  

He penned some of the most important and pathbreaking works on Jainism. His treatise on Sanskrit grammar, the ‘Jainendra Vyakarana’, commands wide respect till today as one of the best and most complete original works on Sanskrit grammar.

  

His ‘Sarvarthasiddhi’ is the first independent commentary on the ‘Tattvarthasutra’ and one of the most concise, establishing definitions that are standard.

  

His ‘Samadhitantra’ is one of the first Jain works on spirituality in Sanskrit. And among the finest, most lucid works on mysticism produced by the shramana tradition.

  

In this work, he deals with the self, establishing it as being independent of the body, of gender, of all the non-self objects that one mistakenly associates with oneself.

  

The work is concise, has only 105 Sanskrit shlokas. It is a tight, beautifully crafted work with not an extra word. The precision of the author’s thoughts matches the loftiness of his spirituality.

  

With this work, Acarya Pujyapada takes us to a world of tranquility and serenity where there is no chaos, no mad rush for more, a world free of attachments and aversions. A a world where we drop all fears and biases, all desires and distractions. It is the world of the atman - sublime, calm and peaceful. A world that is at peace with itself and supremely conscious, immersed in the contemplation of itself and free from all disturbances.

  

The Hindi translation by Dr Jaykumar Jalaj remains quietly in the background, not detracting from the pleasure of reading Pujyapada's simple but eloquent language.

  

Come visit this world of dhyana, jnana and adhyatma. Read the Samadhitantra - A doorway to the world of tranquilness and peace that arise out of knowing oneself.

  

We are truly proud to publish this fine work.
