नवरात्रिशुभाशयाः! May the devI minervA bring you all good things.

  

Stardict dict updater ([sanskritdictionaryupdater](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sanskritcode.sanskritdictionaryupdater)) has gone through several imrpovements which allow it to communicate extraction progress better and deal with many more compressed file formats (beyond the tar.gz files). Further, new dictionary indices (mostly English) have been added ([dictionaryIndices.md](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/stardict-dictionary-updater/blob/master/dictionaryIndices.md "dictionaryIndices.md")). From the sanskrit perspective, I am most excited about the Latin dicts and theAHD_Indo-European_and_Semitic_Roots_Supplement . Use and contribute if you like!
