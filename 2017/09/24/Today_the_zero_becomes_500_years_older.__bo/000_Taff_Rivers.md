Sanskrit mathematics goes back further than believed.  
  
A recent batch of carbon dating is causing the history of mathematics to be rewritten, as it has discovered zeros dating back to a period 500 years before previously seen,  
to somewhere between 224 AD and 383 AD.  
  
The manuscript's been laying around in the University of Oxfordâ€™s Bodleian library since 1902.
