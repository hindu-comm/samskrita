I was aware that Vaasavadattaa is NOT a book on mathematics. But  
people have found it important from the perspective of history of  
zero.  

==>  
  
The word **vikalpaḥ** comes to mind, here  
.  
That particular usage of the term **śūnyaḥ**, does not apply in the context of mathematics, it applies to an altogether different context - that of the imagination.  
  
If I may quote from the mighty **Pātañjala Yogasūtram** on the difference:  
  
 Śabda-jñāna-anupātī vastu-śūnyaḥ vikalpaḥ.  
  
Arghh!  
  
 Mahaguruḥ Taff Rivers.
