उज्ज्वल जी, साधुवाद।

Taff,  
I was aware that Vaasavadattaa is NOT a book on mathematics. But  
people have found it important from the perspective of history of  
zero.  
  
When we talk of 'history of mathematics', all sorts of informations  
are important-  
  
-- where does the word शून्य appear first?  
-- where does it appear as a digit first?  
-- where are operations with zero first dealt?  
etc  
  
Use of 'शून्यबिन्दु' by Subandhu perhaps indicates that शून्य was  
already in use as a digit and that its shape might be resembling a  
'बिन्दु' (dot).
