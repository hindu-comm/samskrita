sunder,  
  
That post of mine, got caught up between updates of the forum.  
It was intended for 'anunaada'.  
  
Here is my intended comment, which happens to apply to yours also:  
  
Neither of your 'zero's' apply to the subject of mathematics, but to an altogether different concept - imagination (**vikalpaḥ**).  
  
  
If I may quote from the mighty **Pātañjala Yogasūtram:**  
  
 I. 9 Śabda-jñāna-anupātī vastu-śūnyaḥ vikalpaḥ.  
  
  

The relevant manuscript, of the mathematical variety, will be on public display on 4 October, as part of a major exhibition, [Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/Plan_your_visit/exhibitions/illuminating-india), at the Science Museum in London.  

  
  
Regards,  
  
Mahaguraḥ Taff Rivers,
