Subandhu's Vaasavadatta (Vāsavadattā of Subandhu) is not about mathematics; it is a romantic novel!  
  
Your IAST source text is taken from the Gretil site, where the transliteration is suspect, viz. *saṃsārasyātiśūnyatvāc chūnyabindava*, where the space the two compounds does not warrant vowel sandhi.   
  
As to how the **bindu** 'dot' actually evolved into the **śūnya** 'zero' is detailed in this recently updated English language Wiki: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)>
