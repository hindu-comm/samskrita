Taff,  
  
I agree with you regarding the suspect quality of the source text. But  
something is better than nothing. There will be many who can detect  
such errors and correct it. I, with my very limited knowledge of  
Sanskrit, could find out the text I wanted to see. Actually, I did not  
find any other machine-readable text for Vaasavadattaa.
