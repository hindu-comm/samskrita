Dear Scholars,

I am not able to read the first marked word in sanskrit is not clearly legible. Is thisवार्ध्नीणस vārdhnīṇasa ? I have not found this word in the dictionary.

  

And the second oneवृपनाशन is legible but its meaning is not found in the dictionary.

  

Kindly help me.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
