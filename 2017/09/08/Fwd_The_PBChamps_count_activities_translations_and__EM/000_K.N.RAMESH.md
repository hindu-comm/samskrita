Dear champions,

  

It is almost time for the BIG celebration. Thank you all for signing up to be a part of this year's program. Some sessions have already begun! Like this little one sharing a story with her friends in Kuppam :<http://bit.ly/2vMg7dq>(also, an inspiration for all our new champions).

  

As always, this is one of the long mails you receive from us - full of news, tips, links and more. We hope this helps you prepare for your session.

  

**First, we need your help...**

  

**Final PBChamps count :**

We are in the final phases of counting the number of champions who are participating this year.*Please take 2 minutes out to help us reach our final count*(if you are conducting a session on your own and conducting only one session, you can skip filling the form):<https://goo.gl/forms/I5aeZ7zZ8ZpOa8AJ3>.

If you are conducting 1 session on your own, then you do not need to fill this form out.

  

***Public events***

Some champions conduct their storytelling sessions at public spaces (bookstores, kids clubs, childrenâ€™s libraries/spaces, etc). These events are open to anyone and not just to a specific crowd (example: children in your locality, children at a school, children at an NGO, etc). For anyone conducting public events, please send us details about your event so that we can spread it among our community too.***  
***

  

A list of all the public events which are open to everyone: <http://blog.prathambooks.org/2017/09/one-day-one-story-public-events-you-can.html>

If you are hosting an event that is open to the public, please send us an email with the link to it and we will add it to this list.

  

If you need any ideas or images for your event, please look at the Poster folder here :<http://bit.ly/2f4fjG8>

***Activity sheet***

We have compiled a suggested activity list.You can either use thoseactivitiesfor your session or can come up with your own ideas:<http://bit.ly/2wGzlzH>

***What to do if you haven't received the book***

We've sent out all the books that you've asked for. Sometimes couriers may reach a little late or we may have made a mistake while packing. We encourage you to not be disheartened if your book reaches you a little late. As we read somewhere - y**ou, dear storyteller, can save the day!**You are the person who is going to bridge the gap between a child who cannot hear a story and one who can. So, please download an e-copy, print it if you want and go ahead with your session. One of my favourite stories of a #PBChamp conducting a storytelling session without a book is of Amol who projected the book :<http://bit.ly/1KpDBVk>. I hope his story inspires you.  

  

***Banners***

We print a limited number of banners. If you haven't received one, please go ahead and conduct the session without it. If you still want to use the banner, here's a link to the soft copy of the banner :<http://bit.ly/2f4fjG8>. Some champions have printed it on their own, project it as a background image and some have even hand drawn the banner.***

***Preparation***

Readthe book a few times. If you are reading to a younger age-group, see how you can tell the story without actually reading the book (to retain their attention. Actually this method is good for older kids too). Think ofactivitiesthat you can do after the storytelling to engage the children (example : can the story take on a skit form, can the story be a way to talk about an important issue, etc). Some champions project images from the book on a tv screen, computer screen or projector too. Two articles that may be of interest :

***Sharing news about your event***  

If you are using Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to share pictures or news about your event, please use the hashtag**#PBChamps i**n your status updates/tweets.

You can also add your stories in the event page :<https://www.facebook.com/events/1395601307204222/?active_tab=discussion>

  

***Press note***

We are in the process of preparing our press note and will add it to this folder by 8th September:<http://bit.ly/2f4fjG8>.If you have any media contacts, you can add a picture of your storytelling session with some details and send it across to them. If your session hasn't been conducted, you can send the attached photo of the book and mention details about your event. Do send us a link if your event is covered by the media.

  

***IMPORTANT : Resource folder***

We have uploaded all the important files and links in this folder :<http://bit.ly/2f4fjG8>. The press release will also be added in this folder.

  

At times, our email id has a limit beyond which we cannot send mails for a short period. In that case, any updates will be added to the resource folder. Look for the document called PBChamps update.

  

The next update will mostly come through our mailchimp id. So, please do check the inbox where all your other promotion mails go to.
