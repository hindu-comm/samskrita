Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste.

  

As **Sri. Hayagriva Jayanti** falls on **Monday (04-Sep-2017)**, I am happy share a short and sweet prayer on **Lord Narayana** by **Akrura** taken from **Brahma Puranam**, and **Chapter 192**.

  

As readers might recall, I had shared all hymns on **Lord Hayagriva** I have come across in the previous years and therefore this one is a generic prayer on **Lord Narayana**.

  

The essence of this prayer is that **Lord Narayana** is the quintessence of this **Universe** and He Himself takes many forms such as **Brahma**, **Vishnu**, **Rudra**, **Tvashta**, etc. and therefore He is beyond all such Kalpanas (of form) - no prize for guessing the sagacity of those preoccupied with the perceived (contrived?) relative superiority/inferiority of such Kalpanas.

  

May We Pray To **Lord Hayagriva** with this beautiful prayer!
