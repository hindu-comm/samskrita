tapan,  
  
 There is a need to distinguish between the *word* Om, as spoken in everyday conversation, and the *sound* Om, as hummed for the purpose of transcendence.  
  
As a humming sound, you are filling your mental universe with a sensation that excites only the aural and tactile senses.  
There are no sights for the brain to see, no smells to smell, no tastes to taste.  
  
But you *are* giving you brain a little something to sense - the tactile vibrations in your thorax.  
Your conscious attention is drawn to them...  
The change in pitch of that humming, will cause the location of that resonance to travel from the thorax up into the cavity of the head.  
Taking the attention along with it.  
  
Take another breath... repeat.  
  
Gradually, as the time passes, the required mental effort becomes habitual and minuscule.  
  
You will notice in the mental quietness that follows, immediately after each particular hum completes, that there is a sort of brightness present.  
Imperceptively growing in brightness.  
  
In my case, the hum was as the sound ome in home - with the h being dropped to give (h)ome or 'ome.  
The trailing m sound being purely a nazal  
I have read that the m is to be sounded both vocalised and nazalised and again that ... but you get the general idea.  
  
Ultimately, occasionally, there is complete blackness, a tunnel, a light, growing, at its end... and an emergence into a white light, clear like air, not white like snow.  
A sense of pure being.  
  
That's it!  
It is simply a matter of giving your brain little to do, and sitting passively for its business to cease, leaving innate mental power, not only with no drain on the resource, but to increase in strength.  
  
Om, is in no way the only instrumental trigger of the state of higher consciousness.  
Viz, William James and his Varieties of Religious Experience - which as it turns out, are not necessarily *religious*.  
  
  
But remembering that power, is merely the ability to do, never used, it might just as well have never been.  
  
It's employment though Power is neutral - that's where wisdom comes in...  
  
Taff Rivers,
