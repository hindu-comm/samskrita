tapan,  
  
h'ome is where the heart is.  
  
If the aim is to communicate understanding in everyday conversation, then *pronunciation* is secondary to that purpose.  
People who provide a single pronunciation, but who fail to advise the questioner of recognised alternatives are questionable in the motives, if not in their knowledge.  
  
Much more relevant to the current global explosion in the practice of *mindfulness,* where Om's eternal purpose is *self realisation* - the realisation of the highest inner state of consciousness.  
Here, Om, is an altogether different humming *sound*.  
  
First-hand accounts from those that have successfully achieved that objective are to be sought, as, by its very nature, there can be no such thing as a second-hand account.  
  
Surveys reveal that the experience itself, is not all uncommon. Om, being the means to deliberately induce it.  
  
Regards,
