**rAmAyaNa audio**  

I've longed to distribute rAmAyaNa-mUla-pATha for the benefit of all, but faced many obstacles - thankfully, shrI M.V.R.Sharma has already done so and more! (vAlmIki rAmAyaNa + AdhyAtma-rAmAyaNa + bhAgavatam + nArAyaNIyam + garuDa purANam) -  

  

<https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Dr.M.V.R.Sharma%22&page=2> In case you prefer to hear via podcast players, consult <https://goo.gl/MrJv7c> as usual.  

  

Enjoy and jaya shrI rAma, jaya hanuman.

  

  

**mahAbhArata recording project**

mahAbhArata is the panchama-veda and should reside in every hindu's heart; but alas one has no means to listen to it in sanskrit. So, I've heard the Illiad and Odyssey but not bhArata.  

  

We're (so far 3 folks) embarking on a project to record and make available freely and conveniently the entire mahAbhArata (in original sanskrit, [gItA-press edition](https://archive.org/details/mahabharata01ramauoft) ). That's 100000+ shloka-s or 4.25x rAmAyaNa-s. So, the more volunteers we find the better; experience tells me that long drawn projects tend to be doomed.  
  
Please contact me offline if you are fluent at (and enjoy) reading sanskrit verses (consult the rAmAyaNa recordings above to get an idea) and can commit time to recording assigned sarga-s within reasonable time. All you need is a smartphone with an appropriate mp3 recording app (eg. [ASR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.asr&hl=en) on android).  

  

kRShNAya tasmai namaH.
