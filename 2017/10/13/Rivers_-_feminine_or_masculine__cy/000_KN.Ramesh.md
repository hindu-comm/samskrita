In general all the rivers are reckoned as feminine.

  

But few doubts:

  

For eg., brahmaputra is masculine - Should we treat it as feminine?

  

similarly, heard in an upanyasam that the rivers Narmada, tapti which are flowing into west are called asनद which is masculine..

  

But in sandhyavandanam, we recite narmadAyai nama: prAtah... which is treating narmada as feminine.
