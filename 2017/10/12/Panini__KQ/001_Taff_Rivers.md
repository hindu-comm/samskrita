Pramod,  
  
 There is a book *A Brief History of Computing* - Gerard O'Regan - Google Books, where the 'concept of decimal place value' is mentioned in connection with *Pāṇini*.  
But, no citations...  
  
As to a certain grammatical work of unknown pedigree, no *decimal places are visible.  
*The pāda-sūtra enunerations are modern. Anyway, whilst they do indeed exhibit *points*, they are not points of the mathematical kind, they are textual subdivision markers.  
  
But please, there is no documentary evidence, even of the very existence of a *Pāṇini*. 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini>  
  
Fame awaits he that resolves this ancient *mystery*.  
Some old bones, some parchments. Matching DNA of bones and parchment should do it, along with some carbon dating.  
All peer reviewed by those that know these things.  
  
All else is a wild goose chase - William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet.  
  
Regards,  
  
Taff
