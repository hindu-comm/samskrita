Taff,  

  

I'm aware of the differences you are talking about.

  

In fact, with ZERO in Mathematics, there are 3 different concepts associated: one is that of the place holder, one is its value and the last one is the symbol. And even if we take ZERO to mean nothing, I agree that there is a difference between mathematical ZERO and the ZERO suffix in the grammar. The only similarity between them is, at some abstract level, both of them mean 'nothing'.  

  

Since the citation had the words zero and Panini (both highlighted),
and there is a book by M D Pandit on ZERO in Panini, I pointed it to Pramod Kulkarni

  

I also do not want to go further into this subject.
