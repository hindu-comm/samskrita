Amba,  
  
*Zero suffix* in this context, refers to grammatical inflections, not mathematical nothings.  
  
Retro-fitting the new on the old is an enjoyable intellectual pastime - when done properly, but...  
  
Pramod's, query exhibits terminological confusion.  
  
Decimal, is a *generic term.* Referencing a *system* of ten digits, the numerals 0 thru 9.  
Decimal place value, is a particular reference. To one of the ten in said system, which *includes* that no-thing thing, the zero.  
  
The manuscripts, referred to as those of the mysterious *famous Indian grammarian, * **Pāṇini, **reference a different numerical system. One that contained *nine* symbols - 1 thru 9.  
To which get added the empty space *textual* character.  
  
  
Now, when moving from the a generic system to a particular system - it is easy to go (or be taken) to, a different system that is only superficially similar.  
Conclusions drawn that way, cannot legitimately be carried back and applied to the original system.  
  
A case of confused thinking where the goalposts get moved behind the scenes, perhaps.  
Not only do grammatical inflections, become mathematical nothings, but non-decimal systems become decimal!  
  
Anyway, Pramod's citation is a non citation, it is altogether not at very thoughtful query.  
  
I rest my case (:-).
