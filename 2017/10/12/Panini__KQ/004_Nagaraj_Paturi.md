This is probably a reference to the technique of lopa used in Panini.

  

Imagine that you make a rule that Word = root + suffix

  

Imagine you have a case where Word = root

  

Then you have to justify your rule "Word = root + suffix ", by stating that in the case on hand, Word = root + null , null meaning 'no suffix'.

  

This is what Panini does.

  

His word for 'null' here, is lopa.

  

This is something similar to phi used in Modern Algebra.
