Hello Taff,  
  

The reference was for

  
**Certain rules given by the famous Indian grammarian[Pāṇini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini)(c. 500 BCE) add a zero suffix (a suffix with no phonemes in it) to a base to form words, and this can be said somehow to imply the concept of the mathematical[zero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_%28number%29).**

  

The query was:

Which sutra(s) of the author is referring to? Pl. tell us  

  

-- Amba
