## Parayana Guidelines

Reading 32 times  

This consists of reading Chapter 1 to 38 on the first day and the rest the next day. This should be repeated 32 times in 64 days

Reading 24 times  

This consists of reading Chapter 1-15 on the first day., 16-41 the next day and the rest of the chapters on the third day. This should be repeated 24 times in 72 days.

Reading 12 times  

This consists of reading Chapter 1-15 on the first day., 16-32 on the second day., 33-51 on the third day and the rest of the chapters on the fourth day. This should be repeated 12 times in 48 days.

Reading 7 times  

Read 7 chapters a day and complete reading on the fourteenth day and repeat it 7 times and complete the parayana in 68 days.

Reading 4 times  

Read ten chapters per day for the first 27 days and read the remaining 2 chapters on the 28th day,

Reading two times  

Read eight chapters per day and complete reading twice on the seventeenth day.

In all these cases on the last day, the last chapter of Yudha Kandam (131st chapter) should be read. On each day before and after the parayana boiled milk with Sugar should be offered as offering (Naivedya) to the God. On the day of completion it is desirable to give a feast to the Brahmins.

It is essential to offer Naivedya to God before and after the Parayana. It would be great if at the end of the Parayana,[Lord Rama](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Lord_Rama "Lord Rama"), Goddess Sita and Lord[Hanuman](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Hanuman "Hanuman")are worshipped using Sahasra Nama (1000 names). If someone is not capable of doing it, he can worship using 108 names of the God. As Naivedya boiled milk added with Sugar is supposed to be best offering to[Lord Rama](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Lord_Rama "Lord Rama")and Lotus and Thulasi (Ocimum) flowers are the best to worship the Lord. If not available any flower can be used. However Karavira(Arali) should never be used. Offering to God Pomegranate would bring in immense benefits.It would be better to the devotee to Chant Rama Gayathri during the beginning, Avahana and end of the worship. This is given by

``` Dasarathaya Vidhmahe, Sita vallabhata Dheemahi, Thanno Rama Prachodayath. ```

After pooja, meditation is done using Gayathri[Mantra](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Mantra "Mantra")or the Shadakshari[mantra](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Mantra "Mantra")of Rama viz “Ram Ramaya Nama.”. Though it is desirable to represent Rama either by Dasavarana Yanthra or statue, it would be sufficient if worship is done to the[Ramayana](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Ramayana "Ramayana")Book. Rama with Sita, Lakshmana and[Hanuman](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Hanuman "Hanuman")always is present wherever[Ramayana](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Ramayana "Ramayana")book is there. It is also essential that whosoever does the Parayana for getting specific objectives should observe[Brahmacharya](http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Brahmacharya "Brahmacharya")during the parayana period.”
