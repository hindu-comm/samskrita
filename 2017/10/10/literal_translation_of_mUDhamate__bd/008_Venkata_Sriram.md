One of my known persons whom I respect most (unfortunately passed away) is Shri.S.N.Sastri Ji who studied vedAnta under Mahamahopadhyaya R.Krishnamurthy Sastry and Shri.Goda Venkateshwara Sastry . One may go thru the explanation for this here in the link:

``` The reference to 'DukRnj karaNe' in Sri Sankara's Bhajagovindam  in this list recently prompted me to make this submission. As has already been pointed out by one of the members, this expression appears in pANini's dhAtupATha with reference to the verbal root kR meaning 'to do'. This can be taken as a reference to the subject of grammar as a whole. The meaning of the particular line in Bhajagovindam would then be, "Grammar will not save you when your end comes". Does this mean that Sankara considers the study of grammar to be useless? That cannot be, because the knowledge of grammar is essential for understanding the meaning of the SAstras. It means only that the study of grammar will not save one from samsAra. But why grammar alone? What about other subjects? Can they save a person from samsAra? Here 'grammar' is 'upalakshaNa' (an indicative word) for all the SAstras, including even the vedas. The Mundakopanishad says that there are two kinds of knowledge—the higher (parA vidyA) and the lower (aparA vidyA). The lower knowledge includes the four Vedas, the science of pronunciation, the code of rituals, grammar, etymology, metre, and astrology (including astronomy). The higher knowledge is that by which the Immutable (Brahman) is realized. The lower knowledge is necessary for all worldly purposes, but it is only the higher knowledge that will deliver one from the continuous chain of births and deaths. Sankara says in vivekachUDAmaNi, sloka 61, "The mere study of all the SAstras is fruitless if the supreme Reality is not known; if the supreme Reality is known then too the study of the SAstras is of no use (they are no longer necessary)". This profound truth is what is implied by the statement  "grammar will not save you". Of course there is also an exhortation to worship Govinda because devotion is an essential means to liberation.

    The word 'mUDhamate' in the first sloka is generally translated as 'fool'. The meaning of this word is not just 'a person deficient in intelligence'. The word 'mUDha' is derived from the verb 'muh' which means 'to be deluded'. So the word 'mUDhamate' means 'one who is deluded'. Every one in this world, including the most brilliant scientists, is deluded by mAyA, until one realizes the Self. So 'mUDhamate' refers to 'all persons who have not realized the Self'.

 In a later sloka the last line is 'bhAryA bibhyati tasmin kAye'. This is generally translated as 'even his wife is afraid of his (dead) body'. But the snag here is that the verb 'bibhyati'  is in the plural (though it looks like singular because it ends in 'ti' and not 'nti'. 'bibhyati' is the third person plural of the root 'bhI'. So the word ' bhAryA' is in the plural (bhAryAH) with the visarga at the end getting dropped because it is followed by the letter 'bi'. The meaning of the word 'bhAryAH' here is therefore not 'wives' but all those who were supported by him, i.e. all his dependents.
