**Fundraiser 2:**

  

Thanks to everybody for making my First Fundraiser a life-saver of sorts as my then unemployment threatened to overwhelm me with greater debts which I still couldn't avoid but the timely generosity of patrons came as a partial relief.

  

This gives me the confidence to raise my 2nd Fundraiser - thanks again to everybody and especially Rakesh Kaul Sir from USA to encourage crowdfunding.

This Kashir Ramayana edited by B.N. Pandit in Kashmiri Language using the Persian Script I was glad to recover:

<https://archive.org/details/KRI113KashirRamayanByPrakashRamKuryagamiEdB.N.Pandit>  

  

Having found most of his oeuvre including his PhD but some Items still missing such as a hearsay that he wrote a commentary on Paramarths Sara which was actually validated in the Other Paramartha Sara published by RSktS Jammu Campus where in the preface the transalator has mentioned consulting BN Pandit's translation.

  

This particular text that I first came to know through the Wiki Page on Shri BN Pandit and was published by JK Cultural Academy, I tried to inquire in the Jammu Office with no avail. Later when I personally visited the Srinagar Headquarters I was told that most of there publications had been destroyed by the floods and there display of the remaining items didnt include this one.

  

  

Total 74 Texts were in Urdu with a preponderance of Old Lahore Publications
