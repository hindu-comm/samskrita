Thanks a lot Dr.Y.N.RAO JI,D.RAMAKRISHNAN JI & IRENE JI for your encouraging comments.

  

GSS. Murthy Garu,

  

Kindly understand the following with regard to my visit to this group & posting, owing to my office commitments:

  

1\) I am not regular in reading the posts as and when they arrive.
Hence sometimes it takes days to respond to a particular thread...

2\) In this case, I tendered my apology when I came to know the source is from YOU before you wrote the comment that I am not apologising for the mistake.

This is because all of my postings are to be approved by the moderator as I am not a priviliged member.

3\) Due to this sometimes my postings may appear 4 or 5 at a time and it remains silent for few days. In fact I wish to post 10 or 15 but fearing it might overload the group I restrict myself to max. 4 or 5.

4\) I understand how paining it will be to see something posted without the source & especially when it written by one's self.

Let me make it very very clear that it is not in my blood to claim someone else's property as mine.

wherever the source is known I always use Courtesy: ............... and give due credit.

  

Once again, pardon me for tendering the apology...

  

With lot & lot of respects and pranaams to the scholars here, I remain
