I am most thankful to Sundarji for having given the reference. However I am not amused that Rameshji continues to maintain silence. There are certainly authors in this group who value their Copyright and I seek their support. Infringement of Copyright is a serious matter and when it is brought to the notice of the person who has infringed the Copyright unknowingly, the first thing he is expected to do is to express his regret and indicate the source. Rameshji has done neither.

The quoted verse is included in Chandrikaa, a collection of my poems brought out by Devavani Parishad, Delhi which is a priced publication. Just because it has appeared in my blog on the internet does not mean that I have surrendered my Copyright. Material on the blog can be certainly quoted and distributed so long as the source is acknowledged and no commercial gain is involved.

As suggested by Rameshji, I did google, "googalam Sharanam vraja" and it does indicate the source.

Besides, it is not clear to me why Rameshji decided to post the quoted verse.

Thanks and Regards,

GSS Murthy
