But one thing every member of this may please appreciate is that Mr. Ramesh has been doing a great service for the cause of the Divine language - Sanskrit by regularly posting many a post related to variety of topics. And, in the course of his efforts, knowingly or unknowingly certain 'mistakes' of this type may crawl up, which is almost natural.
While Mr. G.S.S.Murthy has guided Mr. Ramesh in a right way, I request the other members also to please encourage him(Mr. Ramesh) to continue his efforts in this direction by just ignoring minor 'errors' of this sort, if any. After all, the question of 'Copyright' arises only if some one publishes anybody's writings without permission.  
  

With best wishes,
