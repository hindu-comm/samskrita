Neeru,

  

I have read this book in parts. All I can say is it is very hard to learn Sanskrit from this book. It seems to be written for an audience who is familiar with grammatical terminology. Not just basic knowledge of grammatical categories but far more than that.

Also, this book initially mixes transliterated Sanskrit with Devanagari, however in later chapters it is almost always transliterated text. It seems to me that the opposite way of introducing Sanskrit with transliterated text and

later having only Devanagari text would have made more sense. A person who has studied the classical languages of Europe (viz. Latin and Ancient Greek) may find it ideal to learn Sanskrit from this book but most of us don't fit that category.

  

Also, I understand that the author never got a chance to take the book through the press as he committed suicide before it was published. It seems to have been completed (??) and published by his colleagues.
