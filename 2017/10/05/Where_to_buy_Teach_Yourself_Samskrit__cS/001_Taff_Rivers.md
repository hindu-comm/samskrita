Neeru,  
  
You haven't stated your preferred language, but I can answer for English versions.  
  
 Teach Yourself Sanskrit by Micheal Coulson is available online in PDF form for free, from:  
  
<https://ia800205.us.archive.org/1/items/TeachYourselfSanskrit/Teach%20Yourself%20Sanskrit.pdf>  
  
It is written in English, for English speakers, but despite its subtitle 'a complete course for beginners' a fair knowledge of English Grammar is assumed, as you can see for yourself.  
  
However, if you are thinking of the English language translation of The tested Easiest method... series, published originally in Delhi,  
A commercial hardback copy can be had from the UK, at least, from
