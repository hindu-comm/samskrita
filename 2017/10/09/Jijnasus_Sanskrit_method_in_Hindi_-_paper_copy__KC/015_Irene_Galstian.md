First of all, thank you, Dr. Hattangadi, for the contact details of Arsha Vidya UK.  

  

Second, here is the tale of my great embarrassment. As it turns out, Exotic India Art does sell the book. Here it is:  
  
<http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/learn-sanskrit-easily-through-ashtadhyayi-set-of-2-volumes-NZE662/>  
  

However, the blessed thing is catalogued in such a way that one can't find it by the author's name, and so both I and the Exotic India's rep didn't find it in our searches. I found and quickly bought it just now by entering the entire title into Google search, and the Exotic India item was at the top of the results list.  

Apologies for troubling all of you, but thank you for the useful replies. I learned some interesting things today.  
  

Kind regards,  

Irene
