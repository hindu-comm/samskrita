Dear List,  
  

I would like to buy a paper copy of Jijnasu's Sanskrit method in Hindi. Thanks to the kindness of a list member I have a PDF of it, but the scan quality is grainy. When I send this PDF to others, I often get asked whether a better scan is available, but so far I couldn't find it, and my English copy is no good for people who aren't comfortable with English.  

If anyone knows of a place to buy this book online, please reply.  

  

Kind regards,  

Irene
