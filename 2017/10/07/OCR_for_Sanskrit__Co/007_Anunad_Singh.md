Google OCR has also been integrated with Sanskrit wikisource. Due to this it has become so easy to put any Sanskrit book on Wikisource and converting it into Unicode. Very old books are already available on internet archive and elsewhere in PDF or DJVU format. These are the format accepted by wikisource. And with integration of Google OCR with this, the process of OCR has become very simple, fast and problem free. The accuracy of recognition is excellent. To me it seems more accurate than that from Tesseract in the present conditions.
