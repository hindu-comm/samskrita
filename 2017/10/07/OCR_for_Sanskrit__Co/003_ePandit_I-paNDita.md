I have found google doc's OCR best for Devanagari. Many people are not aware about it. Just upload an image (containing Devanagari text) to google drive, now right click the file in google drive folder and select 'Open with \> Google Docs'. It will put ocred text below image so you can compare recognized text. You may have to do minor edits, you can do this within google docs or download the file as MS word file and do in Microsoft Word later.  
  
If you want to use tesseract, use a easy GUI like VietOCR
