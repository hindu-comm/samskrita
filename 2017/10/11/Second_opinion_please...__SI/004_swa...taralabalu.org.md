Dear All,

There is an error. अदन्ताङ्ग should be re-read as अजन्ताङ्ग. But the question still remains to be answered howनामिovercomes संनिपातपरिभाषा in the case of रामाय. The traditional answer given by Bhattoji Dixit and others may be reviewed by scholars.

Yes, being in public life, I had a long slumber for the last one year on academic matters trying to help the poor farmers of Karnataka heavily hit by drought. I was deeply involved in developing the software called “Bhoomi Online Parihara” (You can see it online). Nearly 30 young software engineers worked day and night on this project. I was instrumental in getting this project and other related Lift Irrigation projects approved by the Government of Karnataka. As a result, many village tanks are filled by Tungabhadra river water and the poor farmers of the entire State of Karnataka got the Draught Relief Fund of Rupees 1,687 Crores credited directly to their bank accounts!
