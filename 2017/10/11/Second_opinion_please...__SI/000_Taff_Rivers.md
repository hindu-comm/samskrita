All,  

  
The forum '[panin...@googlegroups.com]()' appears to have awoken from the dead after being dormant for an entire year.

  

The administrator, Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji, asks:  

  

*"What necessitated Panini to write an independent Sutra नामि 6.4.3 for lengthening अदन्ताङ्ग when it was possible to do the same by सुपि च 7.3.102 ?  
*

*If संनिपातपरिभाषा is the impediment, how do you then justify its (सुपि च ) application in the case of रामाय ?"*

*  
*

I am no expert, but I do not read *7.3.102 *as conveying the same information. To me, the expanded explanation given there in French says as much? *  
*

**

  

 Regards,
