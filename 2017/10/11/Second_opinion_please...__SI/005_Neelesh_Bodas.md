नामि has nothing to do with रामाय. It is सुपि च that overcomes सन्निपातपरिभाषाin रामाय, and the reason given isअनित्यत्व of the सन्निपातपरिभाषा.  
  
Now assuming that your question is - “How come नामि overcomes सन्निपातपरिभाषाin the case of रामाणाम्”, the answer given by Bhattoji Dixit is "आरम्भसामर्थ्यात्". This has been discussed in depth in मनोरमा and लघुशब्देन्दुशेखर, but the gist is that except for a handful of cases , almost all "legitimate" \[see footnote below\] invocations of नामि require contradictingसन्निपातपरिभाषा. Thus, the very fact that नामि exists is a sufficient reason for allowing it to overcome / contradictसन्निपातपरिभाषा. (Otherwise, there was no reason to create sutra नामि).However, that’s not the case with सुपि च; because there are numerous instances in which सुपि च can be invoked without overcoming सन्निपातपरिभाषा(For instance, रामाभ्याम्). And hence, in the case like राम + नाम्, even though "सुपि च" has a chance of “winning” due to परत्व, we do not apply सुपि च because doing so will contradict सन्निपातपरिभाषा, which is not allowed in general.

  
So in essence, in राम + नाम् we are still overcoming संनिपातपरिभाषा, but that is because नामि is designed to do that, and not becauseसन्निपातपरिभाषाis अनित्य.  
  
footnote - by the word "legitimate", I mean a situation wherea deergha is actually required, and not a situation whereनामि is invoked purely by "कृतकारि खल्वपि शास्त्रं पर्जन्यवत्".

  

Hope this helps!
