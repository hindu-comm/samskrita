Just an update. Although I couldn't get one by Sankara Sarma, I found another published by the State Institute of Languages of Kerala in 2011. It is by P K Vasudevan Nair and K Ramachandran. It has padachheda, word by word meaning, grammatical analysis and meaning in Malayalam. I believe they printed only 1000 copies of this book in 2011.

Please let me know if anyone is interested in getting it.
