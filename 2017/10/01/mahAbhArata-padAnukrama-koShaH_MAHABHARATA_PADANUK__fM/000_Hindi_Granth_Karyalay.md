The Mahabharata

**  
**

The Mahabharata was earlier known as Jaya and later as Bharata. Much later, it began to be known as the Maha-Bharata. It is one of the crowning achievements of Indian civilisation. It is arguably the greatest epic in the history of mankind. No wonder it is known as the fifth Veda.

**  
**

The text extols its own greatness: "yad ihasti tad anyatra yan nehasti na tad kvacit"

{Whatever is here is elsewhere; whatever is not here, is nowhere.}  
  
This Work

**  
**

The Mahabharata comprises of 1,00,277 Sanskrit verses. Today, people barely glance through headlines on their mobile phones. Expecting them to read the Mahabharata in its entirety is unreal.   
  
Hence, it was decided to create a verse-wise index of the names and subjects as they occur in the Mahabharata. It enables the reader to quickly search for verses referring to a particular topic, or to a particular person.   
  

Why it is based on the Gita Press recension  
  
An index is companion the main text. Hence, the idea was to choose a recension of the main text which was accessible to all in terms of price and availability.   
  
From the scholarly perspective, the most authoritative recension of the Mahabharata has been printed by the redoubtable Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. But it is only in Sanskrit, it is very expensive and it is not commonly available. The Gita Press edition, on the other hand, fulfills all three criteria. It has an excellent Hindi translation, it is very low priced and is easily available all over India. Hence, the Gita Press recension of the Mahabharata was chosen as the base text.
