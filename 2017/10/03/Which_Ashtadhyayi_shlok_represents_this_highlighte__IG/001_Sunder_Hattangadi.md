Shiv sutras originated from Shiva's Tandava dance.



नृत्तावसानेनटराजराजोननादढक्कांनवपञ्चवारम्।

उद्धर्त्तुकामःसनकादिसिद्धादिनेतद्विमर्शेशिवसूत्रजालम्॥



*( NṚattāvasāne naṭarājarājo nanāda ḍhakkā navapañcavāram. Uddharttukāmaḥ sanakādisiddhādinētadvimarśe śivasūtrajālam.)*



At the end of His Cosmic Dance,

Shiva, the Lord of Dance,

with a view to bless the sages Sanaka and so on,

played on His Damaru fourteen times,

from which emerged the following fourteen Sutras,

popularly known as Shiva Sutras or Maheshwara Sutras.
