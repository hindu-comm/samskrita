Sri Ken P,

  

Ashtaadhyaayee has no s'lokas in it.

  

It is in the form of sutras.

  

The portion quoted by you is also sutras only.

  

You might have noticed that there is माहेश्वरासूत्राणि written on the top of what you quoted.

  

You might have noticed that there are 14 different expressions listed under that title.

  

What these expressions have is nothing but the phonemes of Sanskrit arranged into 14 groups. The phonemes are listed in a sequence in each of these sutras (briefest possible expressions/statements)as the last but one part. The last part of each of these sutras is not part of the intended list of phonemes. That last sound is just a code.

  

अ इ उ - ण्

  

ऋ ऌ - क्

  

ए ओ - ङ्

  

and so on.

  

Panini uses the code to further group the listed phonemes. For that he puts the first sound of a sutra followed by the code at the end of another sutra.

  

For example, if you put अ followed by क् it forms into an expression अक्. This expression अक् indicates the group of phonemes अ इ उ and ऋ ऌ all put together.

  

In the later portions of the book, when he gives sutras (briefest possible expressions/statements) to describe a certain morphophenemic change , to list which phonemes change into which phonemes, he uses this kind of expressions like अक् . Thus, if he wants to say अ इ उ and ऋ ऌ respectively result through the morphophenemic change described in the sutra, he just says 'अक् results' in stead of saying 'अ इ उ and ऋ ऌ results'.

  

This technique is called pratyaahaara.

  

-----------------------

  

Now, the question of why these sutras are being called 'divine' sounds?

  

Two reasons:

  

1\. Those who studied the book Ashtadhyayi develop a great admiration for this amazing technique and use the expression 'divine' to express the admiration.

  

2\. When these 14 sutras are read out, the resulting sound is close to that of a damaru. This is how the legend that the sutras were discovered by Panini by hearing Maheswara's damaru came into existence. Since they are believed to be heard from a divine source, they are called 'divine'.

-----------------------------------------

  

Where are these 'divine sounds' i.e., the 14 sutras found?

  

In the beginning of Ashtadhyayi.
