Anand,  
  
We members, have been attempting to access the thesis that you mention, that we may review all representations for ourselves, that we may validate your dubious assertion.  
  
I, for one, have not been able to locate any of the known āyurvedic texts that match the Vol. Chapter and page or line numbers as given in that extraction.  
  
Neither Dr. Vijaya K. Chaoji, nor D.M.I.M.S. have been contactable.  
  
I concede that my example was not well chosen.  
  
I shall extend my search for indisputable examples to refute your assertion.  
  
Regards,  
  
Taff Rivers
