Anand,

  

What you have done is certainly good but can you not make it more user-friendly? I am not a computer expert by any stretch but I can think of one way of doing that, without requiring too much effort on your part. This is how I would do it - though someone with more expertise could suggest an alternative.

  

1\) Open a blank word file

2\) Keep all page scans as jpg's in a folder, serially arranged.

3\) Click 'Inert - picture' and navigate to the folder where you have kept your jpg's.

4\) Select all and click 'Insert'.

5\) All jpg's will go into the Word file as jpg pictures, serially arranged.

6\) Save the file as a pdf file, rather than as Word file.

  

You shall now have a pdf of the book. Upload it to [archive.org](http://archive.org) as a pdf file. Users can then download that pdf file and use it much more easily that the collection of several jpg's that you have uploaded. This will not take more that a few minutes of your time but will save the users a lot of hassles.
