Anand,  
  
In the nomenclature of In linguistic science, your 'discovery' goes by the name of Transparency (obvious) and is a correlate of Opaque (obscure).  
  
These are technical terms In linguistic science, to be found in such as *The Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar*.  
  
Such occurrences are universal to all of mankind's languages.  
  
  
As suggested by another member, and also It seems to me, that your source text is an extract from one of a number of original bhyasas on the āyurveda of old.  
  
Those qualified to do so will best be able to explain the Sanskrit equivalent of those concepts to you.  
  
  
  
Regards,  
Taff Rivers
