Anand,

  

I visited<https://ancientwisdom341.wordpress.com/>and saw a scan of of an Index of a book about Dentistry in Ancient India. Where are the other pages?

  

BTW, if you have the complete book scanned with you, why do you not upload it, for the benefit of the entire humanity and of the posterity, to a site like [archive.org](http://archive.org) and just give a link?
