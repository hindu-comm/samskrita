To all parties interested in Anand's 'internal consistency' theory.  
  
Will realize that no 'thesis', in whatever format, is required to validate such theory.  
  
Such an exercise is best done against the Ayurvedic ***suśruta-saṃhitā*** itself.  
  
A searchable English language version with transliterated Sanskrit words included, is available from:

You'll need to have a desktop/laptop as it's nearly 50Mb.  
  
 Search for and extract, such words as tooth, teeth, dentistry, then from your list, get to the root of the matter - test for transparency to validate Anand's 'internal consistency' theory for yourself.  
  
Or do likewise with other URL's of Ayurvedic text sources already provided here.
