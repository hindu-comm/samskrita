Dear Taff ,

  

I never knew that I had reached that depth in research as you are pointing out.

  

For incisor the point is taken. What about Molar. Molar comes from Massive. So if you are shown a molar of human and incisor of say a camel, and asked to choose a molar , from Nirukta you will have to choose the camel tooth. To be guided properly you have to fall back on the definition.

  

Whereas in Sanskrit , for all teeth, the meaning directly follows and one does not have to take support from here and there. That is the point I am making when I say Sanskrit is internally consistent.

  

The description in English is like someone is looking into the native's mouth, whereas in Sanskrit it is the native who is talking. In both cases there is Dhrami but the Dharmi is different.
