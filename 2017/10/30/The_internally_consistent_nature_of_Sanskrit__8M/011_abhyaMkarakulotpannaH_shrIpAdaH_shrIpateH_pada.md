When people say "no such thesis is extant", they often refer to references in many languages, except Sanskrit.

  

Most people doing doctoral work have to start their thesis with literature survey, to make sure that the research work being presented in the thesis would not be a repeat of what has already been researched. But most literature surveys do not take cognizance of work already researched in Sanskrit literature. To my mind, such literature surveys are themselves incomplete. So, if literature surveys themselves are incomplete, should the thesis deserve recognition as doctoral work ?
