Anand,   
  
This question has been discussed by the wise men of Sanskrit, way back in the bronze ages,  
Viz. Patañjali Yoga Sutra, III.14, where we are informed that actions, require an actor. (Dharmas require dharmis).  
  
Not only is your knowledge of Sanskrit a little out date, but also that of your English is at least half a millenium old.  
\*Not to mention being somewhat misrepresented.
