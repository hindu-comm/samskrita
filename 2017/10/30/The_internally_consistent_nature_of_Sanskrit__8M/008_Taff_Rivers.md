Anand,  
  
What 'Thesis on Dentistry in Ancient Times'? Are we talking Aryuveda here, because as far as the world at large is concerned no such Thesis is extant?  
  
Can you provide us with the original Devanagari, please.  
  
As for 'nomenclature', being English, I understand the word means 'a system of names or terms'? Samkhya enumeration, perhaps?  
Samkhya, equates to Taxonomy - the science of classification, and has numerous 'nomenclatures', even in 'Ancient Times'.  
  
'Examples from other areas'?  
  
Examples of what, from what?  
  
Examples of lists of things? And from what 'areas', Areas of Sanskrit treaties or of global geographic regions, and of what historical era(s).  
  
Regards,  
 21st Century guru Taff Rivers,
