Anand,  
  

==>  

Did not understand.Pleass elaborate. It is more of a query than Disquery.Please help making it transparent.

==>

  

Sure. Glad to assist you.

  

**semantically transparent words:**  

 compounds whose “meaning is predictable on the basis of the word-formation rule according to which they have been formed.”  
  
Based on these principles we consider the compound “storybook” which means “a book containing stories”;  
  
if we go on with the same principle we would assume that the compound “cookbook” means “a book containing cooks\*”,  
but a“cookbook “ is “a book containing recipes for cooking”.  
In case of full opacity, analyzability and predictability by parsing of the constituents would lead to a wrong interpretation.  
  
As to scriptural references to teeth, using hanu-mokṣa as an example you will be dissapointed to discover that its meaning is not 'internally consistent'.  

  

Parsing provides ' tooth - liberation' which as a self-descriptive (transparency) term, means tooth-falling-out-condition.

  

However, that inference would be incorrect (opaque), as the text itself\* inform us that is means dislocation of the jaw.

  

The author of the thesis you refer to, Dr. Vijaya K. Chaoji, does not provide an email address, but there is a Tel. no.  
I don't know if she speaks English, I assume she speaks Hindi.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers
