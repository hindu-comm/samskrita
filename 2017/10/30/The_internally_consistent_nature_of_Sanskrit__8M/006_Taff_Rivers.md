Anand,  
  
==>

  
The description in English is like someone is looking into the native's mouth, whereas in Sanskrit it is the native who is talking. In both cases there is Dhrami but the Dharmi is different.  

==>  
  
Dharmi is that which actually does the grinding. Which in languages, old and new is the ***tooth***.  
  
Again, your Sanskrit grindings etc. are not exactly without 'support', are they?. Unless my eyes deceive me, I see the word 'Dentistry' and 'various teeth' in supporting your assertion!  
  
Those wise men of ancient times will have us discriminate between the material cause - the tooth - and the instrumental cause, the camels or the millstones etc.  
  
As to experiencing grinding from the inside, as a native (the English term for it is endogenous (internal)).  
Experiencing said grinding from the outside, with the aid of a mirror perhaps, (exogenous (external)).  
  
The Sanskrit YS has words for such distinctions too.  
  
Consistency?  
 Coherent or coherence. Eeither or both?  
  
 All the parts in your particular list are nouns of action and can be said to to be internally, grammatically in agreement - coherent.  
 But whereas the list itself is indeed in logical agreement with the preceding statements re. 'Dentistry', and thus has coherence.  
 The logic of the following statements bear no such consistency.  
  
Whereas I have encountered a camel or two in my travels in the middle east, the ones I met spoke neither Sanskrit or English and I had no Arabic, so I never got to ask them about their molars :-)!
