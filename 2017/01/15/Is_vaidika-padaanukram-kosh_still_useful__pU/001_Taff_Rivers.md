can be fetched. However, *'almost a quarter of words in the Vedic texts ...appear just once*'.  

  

A concordance may well list other occurrences, but comparison will not necessary clarify the issue, but may well further confuse the issue with ambiguous or conflicting senses of the word.

There is a brief etymology listing taken from that work, available on-line from <http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/sarasvati/dictionary/9niruktam.htm>

  

  

More info on Wiki: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirukta>
