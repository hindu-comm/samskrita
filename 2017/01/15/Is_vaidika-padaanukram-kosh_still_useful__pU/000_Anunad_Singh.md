I have two questions-  
  

\(1\) Is वैदिक पदानुक्रम-कोश same as सर्वानुक्रमणी or अनुक्रमणी?  

\(2\) In view of availability of most of the vaidik literature in Unicode and free availability of advanced tools (like concordancing tool, search tools etc), is the anukramaNii stiil useful? Is it not true that if these tools are used, more-information can be fetched in less time and that it can be presented in a more meaningful format?
