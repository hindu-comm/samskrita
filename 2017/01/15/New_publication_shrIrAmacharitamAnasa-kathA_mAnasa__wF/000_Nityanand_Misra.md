Dear list

  

The latest book by Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Ramabhadracharya was released yesterday at Patna, Bihar, on the occasion of Makara Sankranti. The book details and download links are below, and a PDF copy of the book is attached. The book is co-edited by Dr. Ramadhar Sharma and me.

  

This is the first book I have typeset with MikTeX 2.9.6100 64-bit (r.3614278) which was released in 2016.LaTeX source files of the book are not available now, but will be made available as soon as I have cleaned the code a bit (which will take time given my current schedule).
