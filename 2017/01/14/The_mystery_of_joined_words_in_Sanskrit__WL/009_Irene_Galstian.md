Indeed, it does create a challenge.

  

However, since sentences contain words, and the recognition of words is what solves the problem of 'decryption', then it's also worth compiling a strategic vocabulary, say 2,000-3,000 words.

  

One simple way to do that is to visit a digital corpus and get the most frequent words in 15-20 central texts, eg Mahabharata, Manu, etc.

  

But is there a better way, in your opinion?
