For the learners whose mother tongues or first languages have significant portion of tatsama words (Sanskrit borrowings with change in only the suffix part and no change in the remaining part of the borrowed Sanskrit word), it is easier in this aspect, compared to the learners whose mother tongues or first languages have less or no tatsama words.

  

For example, most of my students have Telugu as their mother tongue. Telugu has a high percentage of tatsama words and most of the modern technical terms /neologisms too in this language are tatsamas.

  

Many Indian languages have this situation.

  

Tamil has equally big number of Sanskrit borrowings but most of them are tadbhavas ( Sanskrit borrowings whose non-suffix portion too is adapted as per the phonetic structure of the borrowing language, in this case, Tamil).

  

If the learner has a non-Indian, more accurately, non-South Asian language as the mother tongue, this aspect creates a huge challenge in learning.

  

Right pedagogical strategy in such a case is to teach sentences without compounds in a big number, to supply as much vocabulary as possible and then teach sentences with compounds.
