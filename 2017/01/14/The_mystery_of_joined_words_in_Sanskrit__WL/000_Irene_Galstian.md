Dear all,  
  
As we know, in Sanskrit texts words are often 'glued' together, and so present a difficulty for new learners. Why? Mainly because a learner has an insufficient vocabulary and is unable to recognise words that he has never seen. Because of that he can't look them up in the dictionary. Contrary to a popular belief, sandhi isn't the problem, but the lack of vocabulary certainly is.  
Thus, my question to this list. Many of you received traditional education in Sanskrit, taught for many years, and are still teaching. Time and again, you observe your students progressing from not knowing how to read these 'word clusters' to reading them competently.  
Could you please share your observations? How does this happen?  
If, in addition, anyone is aware of any linguistic research on this, I'd be grateful for the references.  
  
Kind regards,  
Irene
