samAsas that too deergha nibiDa samAsas is a feature seldom found in English.

  

Speaking-hearing communication is different from writing/printing-reading communication.  

  

The spaces helping word-splitting in English and absence of such spaces causing difficulty in Sanskrit applies to writing/printing-reading communication.  

  

In speaking-hearing communication, English too has gapless, continuous pronunciation of words in any sentence.

  

But that is different.

  

The issue at hand is deergha nibiDa samAsas of Sanskrit which has no parallel in English.
