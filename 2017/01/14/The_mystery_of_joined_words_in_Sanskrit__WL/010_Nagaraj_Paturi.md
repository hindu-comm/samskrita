Yes, since technology has come in handy now, we can do it that way.

  

Another way is to keep certain long samAsas that the teacher wants to introduce in the later to priliminary classes in mind introduce the component words of those samAsas as vyasta words in the preliminary classes so that the mechanism of splitting the joined words is drilled with confidence.

  

Once the sandhi processes are all known, gradually the the number of words and the joined expressions can be increased, yes, keeping the frequency in mind.

  

Once the students get the heck of it, they can manage the catch 22 situation better. i.e. they can simultaneously handle the vocabulary learning and sandhi-splittings prioritizing one aspect at a time. Which aspect they prioritize at a given time can be left to them.

  

After a certain stage, they reach the stage at which you are now and you know how it works after that.
