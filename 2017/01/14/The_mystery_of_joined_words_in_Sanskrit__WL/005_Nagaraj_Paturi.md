Mr Ken,

  

You are again reducing/ diverting the discussion into written/print-reading communication.

  

The original discussion is not limited to /concerned with writing /printing conventions.

  

Your example doesn't have morphophonemic (Sandhi) changes at Samhitaa (parassannikarshah) points.

  

The question being addressed is whether these morphophonemic changes or the lack of vocabulary which is causing difficulty to a Sanskrit learner in following long compounds with a big number of Sandhi morphophonemic changes.

  

The thread initiator's contention is that the prior knowledge of the words involved in the Sandhi can help the learner split the Sandhi easily.

  

For example in विद्युच्छक्तिः, if the learner knows that there is a word विदयुत् , he can guess that the विद्यु part of the compound might have got to do with that. Similarly if he knows that there is a word शक्तिः he can guess that the च्छक्तिः part might have got to do with that.

  

If he doesn't have such a prior knowledge, he might not even know where to look for the morphophonemic change to have taken place.
