I agree with your observation that knowledge of vocabulary helps in breaking the anughaTaka words of a samAsa however deergha or nibiDa (with sandhis) it is.

  

I think even a brain as stupid as that of a computer can (be helped to) identify the anughaTaka words of a samAsa if it has the words in its database from which it can draw /call / query strings and compare with the sequence of syllables /phonemes in the samAsa and stop at an identical or close to identical string being found.
