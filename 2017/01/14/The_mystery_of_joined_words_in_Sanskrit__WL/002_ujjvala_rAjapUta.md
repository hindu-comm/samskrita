Why only Sanskrit? In most languages, including English, when listening, we don't get to hear any special sounds that mark the end of individual words. The difference between English and Sanskrit is that when writing English, spaces are used to mark end of words, but not so in Sanskrit. But with Sanskrit, one can read and pronounce the written text and then it becomes same as spoken language and then the learning experience is almost identical to that of learning a language by listening.
