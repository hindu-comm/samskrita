Hi Taff,

It is not about proficiency in XML. It is about persistence and two way conversion with zero information loss. If new items or markups are added into XML, and there is no programmatic tool to create wikipedia articles from it, manual copy pasting for 4000 sUtras is madness.

  

Similarly if the community corrects some typographical errors in wikipedia, but there is no computational way to generate XML from it, both will not keep pace with each other.

  

XMLs have great applications in computer science.
