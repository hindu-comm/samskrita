The XML file was converted into wiki format by replacing the tags using simple find & replace technique in a text editor. In the present state, wikisorce file will not change automatically as and when the XML file changes. But a new file can be created from the modified version of the XML file easily using the find & replace technique (the number of tags is not much). The good thing is that somebody can think of a better format of presenting the SiddhantaKaumudi creating a new file from the modified vrsion (if any) in the future.
