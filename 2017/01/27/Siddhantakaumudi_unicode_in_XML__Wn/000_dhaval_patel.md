Apologies for cross posting.  
  

Dear all,  
  

I had been searching for Siddhantakaumudi in unicode for quite some time. Online resources of Paninian grammar usually had commentaries like Balamanorama available, but not original.  

I recently got one copy of SK from Mr. H. N. Bhat via mailing list Bharatiyavidvatparishat.  
  

After certain cleanups and addition of markups, SK unicode is being presented for computational purposes in XML format for further modifications.  
<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/siddhantakaumudi/blob/master/sk.xml>  

(Click on Download button to download)  

  

Issues regarding markups / features etc may be noted in <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/siddhantakaumudi/issues>.  
  

This is the github location where future correction to this XML file will be made. Git is chosen so that version changes are captured properly.  
  

Regards,
