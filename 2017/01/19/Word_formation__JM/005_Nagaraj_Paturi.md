\>May I ask you why is that Sanskrit gives two different pronunciations to**र**?

  

\> र  in रथ is pronounced differently than र  in क्रम , where it is conjunct with another consonant.

  

Sanskrit gives?

  

Do you mean that you observed two different pronunciations ? or you observed two different pronunciations when you yourself pronounce the sound represented byर in these two different positions?

  

In any case, if your question comes from your own observation, I must say , you are a keen observer of sounds and you are right.

  

But let me tell you that such a minutely different pronunciation of a sound represented by a script symbol in various positions of a word is not the special feature of Sanskrit.

  

In any language with a script, you get this feeling, though the phenomenon is found in all languages irrespective of whether they have script or not.

  

र  in रथ andर  in क्रम are called two different phones and are considered to be variations of the same sound. That sound of which these two are considered to be variations is called a phoneme. The script symbolर represents that phoneme.
