Sinu,

  
र and ऋ are not interchangeable.

  

What we have here, is one of the processes whereby nouns are *derived* from a verb.

  

The form *krama* is created from the root *kṛ*by the application of a series of those dreaded *Pāṇinian* grammatical *rules.*

This particular*Pāṇinian*process involves something called the affixing of a**kṛt *affix*.

  

That is the written script.

As to the spoken word, र and ऋ may be pronounced alike or differently.

From one grammar book *Maurer's*, I understand that the ऋsound depends on which part of India you happen to be in.  

  

Choose your Grammar sources that are written for readers in *your* first language,and especially by those that have taught so.

  

Reading comes first, most of those rules are relevant only for advanced writers.
