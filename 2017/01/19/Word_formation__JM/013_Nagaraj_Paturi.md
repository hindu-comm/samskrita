\>In Telugu and Malayalam, most probably, replacing one sound of 'r' with the another might change the meaning of the word. This does not happen in Sanskrit.  

  

------ This is an accurate observation. But applies to Tamil and Malayalam in the case of 'r' and applies to Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam in the case of 'l'. Technically, that is what makes the two 'r' s two different phonemes in Tamil and Malayalam, two 'l' s two different phonemes inTelugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. In Sanskrit, the different 'r's are not different phonemes because replacing one 'r' with another does not change the meaning. Different phonemes need different script symbols. In Sanskrit different script symbols are not required because of the reason mentioned by Sri Ujjval Rajputji.
