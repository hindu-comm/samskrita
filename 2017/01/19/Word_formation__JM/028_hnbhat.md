क्रम is not created from the root kṛ, by any Pāṇinian rule, but fro the root kram. The rest is is only from the confusion of Shinu regarding vowel is interchangeable with the consonant. Only r is substitute for ṛ when it is followed by vowel which is never explained as k+ṛ+a by anyone grammarian except Shinu.
