Indeed the differences in sounds are minute. But these sounds are made with different positioning of the tongue. My observation that Sanskrit being a very strict language, why isn't there specific letters for the two sounds like Telugu and Malayalam languages ? Also in the wordक्रम the sound felt as though it was derived from ऋ + अ, hence the first question.

  

Thank you very much for your valuable inputs.
