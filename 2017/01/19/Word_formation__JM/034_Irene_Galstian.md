Indeed, Taff, I do want authentic Devanagari in this case.

  

As for your question, I didn't want to be at the mercy of university politics. Here in the UK mathematicians are now pressured into proving that their work is 'useful', God help us all.

I am an independent mathematician, you could say. If I want to teach, I teach. If I want to do 'useful' mathematics, I take on image analysis/bioinformatics/comp linguistics projects, or do some coding for a Vedic astrology research study. And if/when something new and significant is found in algebraic geometry (my former love), I'll hear about it from the mailing lists and Arxiv anyway. Life's better that way, IMO.

  

Kind regards,

Irene
