Irene,

  

Best to scan the world at large, there to choose the format, quality, style, clarity, etc. that best meets personal requirements.

  

Google for*paniniyas shiksha* with various spellings and scripts.

  

But must it be a book?

  

Here is a one free downloadable PDF, for example:
<http://hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/shiksha/paniniya_shiksha.pdf>

  

If all you actually want is some *authentic* devanagari, upon which to practice your sandhi splitting etc, you will want the well-known texts, where you are guided along step by step.

  

  

BTW. You would not be a certain professor of mathematics in your day job would you?
