\> Divine Sanskrit may have different symbolic sound forṛ =ऋ practiced by

Vedic Gurus who in past never reveal these sounds to common people.

  

---- S'ikshaa granthas were meant only to provide meticulous pronunciation guidance of various sounds pronounced in the Vedic and Sanskrit expressions is a common knowledge to any elementary student of Sanskrit studies. That the pronunciation ofṛ =ऋ was also described as meticulously in those books is also well known. Why do you make these statements without verifying with a knowledgeable scholar or a student of Sanskrit senior to you?
