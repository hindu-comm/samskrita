You have not digressed, since I said such minute differences are not unique to Sanskrit.

The difference between r in ratha, and r in krama is because of the difference in the position of the sound in a word.

  

using C for consonant V for vowel, 

r in ratha is in # \_VCA# sequence and r in krama is in #C_VCV# sequence.

  

Vocal muscles move differently in a word initial position than in a next to consonant position. That creates a minute difference in the acoustics so created.
