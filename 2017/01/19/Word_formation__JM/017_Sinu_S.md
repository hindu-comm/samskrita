I was confused why in Sanskrit र and ऋ are used interchangeably. रis a consonant while ऋ is a vowel. क्रम (sequence of doing) must have its origin in कृ which is क् + ऋ, where asकारक (causing) also must have it root in कृ, but uses र. Also र and ऋ makes slightly different sounds. I hope to understand more as I continue my study of grammar. and thanks for all the help.
