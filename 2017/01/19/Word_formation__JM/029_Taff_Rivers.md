Professor,

  

 Thank you for the correction.

  

Under the entry for *krama* in the Monier-Williams, I read

  

  • (kramaṃ √ 1. kṛ, 'to follow that rule'), Nyāyam.

  

On re-reading, I notice the entry immediately above*krama*is another root *kram.*

*  
*

  • P. to be liable to the peculiar arrangement of a Vedic text called Krama (i.e. to be doubled, as a letter or word), RPrāt. vi, 4.  

  

Even here, there is an ambiguity. Are we to understand that Kramais *a* Vedic text (singular) or an arrangement of words *in* Vedic texts (plural)?

  

And RPrāt is stating that a letter to be *doubled*, as opp. to *substituted.*

*  
*

  

Things differ not only according to the writers but also to the readers.

  

  

Regards,

  

 Taff
