Honestly I cannot perceive any difference in pronunciation of "ra" in "ratha" and "krama".

But I am aware that 'ra' is pronounced in a significantly different manner by those in middle East (Arabic/Persian/Hebrew??).

However in Kannada I have noticed a subtle difference in pronouncing ತ in the two words ತಂದೆ =father and ತಂದೆ = I brought. I wonder if anyone else speaking Kannada has any comments on this. I am sorry if I have digressed.

Regards,

Murthy
