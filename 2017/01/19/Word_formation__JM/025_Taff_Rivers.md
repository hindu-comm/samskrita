Ken P,  
  

 I do not know what your first language is, but you do realise that your understanding of the English language leaves a lot to be desired?

  

This is not only evident from your reading of members post where you repeatedly fail to grasp the question, but also in your replies which evidence a somewhat garbled sense of English.

  

Viz, the attached.

  

!. matra. There is no such word, neither in English nor in Romanised Sanskrit.   

  

2\. Your table has nothing to do with pronunciation, which concerns *spoken* Sanskrit, It is a table of *written* vowels which is*scripted* Sanskrit.

  It does not even include that *semi-vowel*, the sole subject of this entire topic.

  

  The table simply shows the *written* form that vowels take when they come after consonant(s).

  They are commonly referred to as *vowel-signs*,or *half-forms* of the vowels

  

mātrā concerns the *relative length of time* that a vowel is sounded, and is nothing to do with its use in combinations of any form or with pronunciation itself.

Now,can you see that your statement No matra is used for the combination अ*,*requires the mind of a Sherlock Homes to unravel its meaning?

  

This is all stuff that comes in the very introductionof any treatment of Sanskrit grammar,before even Chapter I

It comes along with a guide to pronunciation - given in the readers own language - people don't speak phonetic speak, any such is as welcome of graffiti.
