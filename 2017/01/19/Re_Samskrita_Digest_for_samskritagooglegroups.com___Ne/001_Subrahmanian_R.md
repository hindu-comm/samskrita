Sarangapani is the Tamil tatbhava for शार्ङ्गपाणि. Though सारङ्ग refers to deer, the name सारङ्गपाणि for Siva is not seen commonly.



There are regional variations and different transliteration conventions. Writing in Roman Script Srikanth – a Tamilian takes it as श्रीकान्त and for a North Indian it is श्रीकण्ठ. The very first अक्षर – अ – has different pronunciations across the sub-continent – It is Aravinda for a Tamilian, Arvind (schwa) for a North Indian and Aurobindo for a Bengali.



To repeat, Sarangapani is the method of writing शार्ङ्गपाणि for a Tamilian and for him it is the right way. Just as दोशी and दोषी are transliterated (and probably pronounced) as Doshi by a section of people, शार्ङ्गपाणि as well as सारङ्गपाणि are pronounced alike by Tamilians.
