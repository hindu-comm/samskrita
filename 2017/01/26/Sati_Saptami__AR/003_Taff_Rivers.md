Sati Saptami.

  

 In English grammar this is really the*Nominative Absolutive*.

  

Where *absolutive* is English grammar speak for *relatively independent syntactically.*

  

\- but here it is only so when positioned as the subject of the verb.

  

As such, s*ati saptami*is a *special case* of Sanskrit's 7th or vocative one, where the absence of an inflection leaves it open to a speculation of a the preposition kind.

(or to put it another way, to speculate this way, that way...on and on and on endlessly..)

  
This morsel of information, is gleaned from the end of Lesson 10 in Walter Harding Maurer's book (Revised edition 2009.). But Grammarians are notoriously argumentative.

Chomsky too, is disputed.
