Hi Kousalya,

  

Here is what I have put together from all my study sources:

  

**Locative Absolute** **(Sati Saptami) ̶** To express *as* or *while* or *when* (a simultaneous circumstance), a pres. p. or ind.p. is used.
But when the circumstance does not involve the subject of the sentence these cannot be used. Instead a short nominal phrase all in 7^(th) case (except for indeclinables) can be used, called locative absolute, or saptami.



 *Using a past participle*: kāle ṡubhe prāpte, *an inauspicious time having arrived*; aparādhe kṛte ápi, *though an offense be committed* (using a p.p.); evám uktó ﮐpi, *even such being said*.



 *Using a present participle*: tasmin dahyamāne, *as it was burning*

 *Using a past active participle*: *despite this being said*; evám abhíhitavati pārthive, *the king having spoken thus*. (See You-Male (Formal) chart and Śatru pratyayaha chart.)



 **Sati Saptami:** Sometimes the short nominal phrases may include the pres.p. of ásti ‘while being’ in 7^(th) case, though it is usually redundant. Ex.: Sītāyām paṭhatyām satyām (f) *when Sītā studies/is studying*. Ásti pres.p. = sánt (san/satī́/sat mfn).



 The same meaning can be expressed using cases other than 7^(th), matching the case of the noun involved. Ex.using 3^(rd):
prasanna-manasā satā Mādhavena, *by Mādhava, being of tranquil mind*.
Coulson, 1992.



 But more often, instead of locative absolute an adjective compound is used (bahuvṛīhi): ṡoka-saṃvigna-mānasa:, *his mind overwhelmed with grief* (or *having a mind over*º).



 Another possibility is simply an abstract noun in 7^(th).
Rākṣanasya agráhaṇe, *with the demon not captured* (literally *in the demon’s not being captured*).
