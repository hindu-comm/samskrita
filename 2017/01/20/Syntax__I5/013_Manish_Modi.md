Dear Irene,

Jay Jinendra

  

Level 5 of 'Teach Yourself Sanskrit' has not yet been printed. Trust me, I shall shout from rooftops once it is published! :-)

  

Dr Ashok Aklujkar has a splendid collection of Sanskrit plays and kavi sammelanas on his laptop. He had shared them with me many years ago, when we had met for the first time. I do not have them now. But you could ask him to email them to you.

  

I am sure that he is active on this list. And most likely, you know him.

  

In case you do not, here are his contact details:

Best wishes,

Manish
