Irene,

  

If there any Samskrita Bharati classes in your area that would be a good start. Samskrita Bharati also sells many audio and video material (and of course all of that they sell are in Sanskrit only).

  

Here's a Kumarasambhavam sarga-05 - <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLofrqGxIuL6QW0-Hsu6XkPtkI8qpSdAOb> -
taught at the residential camp called Kaveri (conducted every year in the Saratoga, CA during memorial day weekend), conducted by Samskrita Bharati.
