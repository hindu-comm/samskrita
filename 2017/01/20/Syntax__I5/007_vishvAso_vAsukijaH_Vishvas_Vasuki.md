I have glanced at Dr. Narasing Rao's lessons on Youtube, but I can hardly bear to watch them at any length since I am already very familiar with the material (sanskrit) and since I prefer instruction in Sanskrit (or atleast an Indian language) by a large margin.  

  

But, good to know that it benefits anglophones! Are you able to use (speak, write, read) the language as a result of following those videos?
