PS If you know of a good video/audio course that teaches Sanskrit via Sanskrit (ie the teacher speaks only in Sanskrit from the very beginning), please mention the details here. I'd love to buy this course, especially its intermediate/advanced levels. It would also be lovely to have more things to listen to/watch in Sanskrit, other than DD News and Iyers' films.
