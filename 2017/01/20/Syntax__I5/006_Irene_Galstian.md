I do see your point, even though Duolingo's approach seems overly dumbed down, in my opinion.

Have you seen Dr. Narasing Rao's lessons on Youtube? Dr Rao uses Kutumbasastri's Teach Yourself Sanskrit textbook, published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. The book consists of 5 levels. Dr Rao has recently uploaded lesson number 504, from Level 3. Levels 1 and 2 are already complete.

It's remarkable that Dr Rao and his technical assistant, a young man by the name Srinivas, accomplished more with the aid of a single computer, microphone, webcam, whiteboard, and basic video editing software than many large organisations.

Speaking of Kutumbasastri's book, Levels 1-4 (18 books) seem to be back in stock again at Hindi Granth Karyalay. Level 5 is still unobtainable. If anybody knows how to get the Level 5 books, or has scans of them, or is willing to make scans, please respond.
