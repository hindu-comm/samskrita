Irene,

  

==> Or perhaps there is somewhere an extensive exposition of Sanskrit syntax that I ought to read? \<==

  

There certainly is. Read the introduction to get the full picture.

  

Here's the pdf of a book that should help in understanding those commentators of old,

and especially why they wrote the way they did *which was according to a prescribed formula.*

  

There's much more to it than syntax and terse rules of grammar:

  

*Scholastic Sanskrit. A Manual for Students*.

The PDFshould inspire you to buy the hardback version

  

Taff Rivers,
