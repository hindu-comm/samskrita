The purpose of these videos is somewhat different: they help to 'convince' one's mind that Sanskrit is something familiar and regularly repeated.

If one has access to a teacher, the videos can be used to self-check the exercises against Rao's solutions and hear all the sentences pronounced. The time with the teacher is then used more productively, e.g. by focusing on matters that either remain unclear after watching Rao's lessons, or aren't addressed by Kutumbasastri/Rao at all.

As the levels progress, Rao increasingly speaks in Sanskrit, and one can pick up potentially useful sentences from that, then proceed to construct one's own by substitution (that's how Samskrta Bharati courses operate too).

If one has no teacher, it's still possible to get to intermediate level with Rao's videos, assuming the student is disciplined and imaginative. The combination of these two qualities is relatively rare, and so the chances of succeeding are modest, but nonzero.

A living teacher remains valuable, and that'll probably always be the case.
