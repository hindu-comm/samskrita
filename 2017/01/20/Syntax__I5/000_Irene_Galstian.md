This is a question I had for a while, and a recent comment by Nagaraj Paturi reminded me of it.  
Sanskrit sentences often exhibit syntax that is unexpected, and therefore not immediately interpretable by a non-Indian learner. Not just Sanskrit, mind you. When I fist learned that the subject of the sentence can sometimes appear in the accusative in Arabic, it took me a bit of time to get used to it.  
In the conversation about Sandhi Nagaraj Paturi explained that for Telugu speakers sandhi is simpler because Telugu language predisposes them to it. But what about syntax? Does the same apply? Or perhaps there is somewhere an extensive exposition of Sanskrit syntax that I ought to read?  
  
Kind regards,  
Irene
