Dear Nagaraj,

  

God, no. I wouldn't presume to teach anyone other than myself (I've taught Russian, but certainly not Sanskrit). It's best to leave such matters to better qualified people. Coding and mathematics I can manage, but that's it for now.

  

The NP-NP construction you mentioned may be unusual in English but it's unsurprising in Russian, for example. In fact, out of all the languages I have come across, Russian is perhaps the most similar to Sanskrit. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a comparative study of Russian and Sanskrit syntax, which would have been supremely useful.

  

My next best bet was English (because it's widely used, and for no other reason). Apte's Sanskrit composition book is helpful. I don't have Speijer, so can't comment.

Rather than engaging in comparison between languages as dissimilar as English and Sanskrit, it would have been useful to have side-by-side versions of nontrivial sentences in the two languages. That would allow the learner to get a feel of how Sanskrit flows. So far Apte is the closest I could find to that. Taff's link looks great though.

  

Kind regards,

Irene
