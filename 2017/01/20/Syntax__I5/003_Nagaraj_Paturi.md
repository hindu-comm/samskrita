Dear Mr/Dr/Prof. Irene Galstian,

  

Since you are teaching students, probably, with a European background, a book dealing with a comparison between Europen language syntax and Sanskrit syntax should be coming in handy for you.

  

One aspect of Sanskrit syntax , that might look strange for a European student, not to a student with Telugu or other Dravidian languages as mother tongue or first language, that immediately comes to my mind, is the so called equational or NP-NP sentence which has a Noun Phrase for both subject and predicate. Since this is not found in the other IE languages, historical linguists consider this to be influence of Dravidian on Sanskrit, this is found in Rigveda itself though.

  

Bhartrihari in vAkyapadIyam calls these sentences as as'ritakriyAvAkyAh. The term shows that he considers that there is a sentence with a copula verb such as asti/bhavati in its 'ground structure' (in Chomskian parlance) of these as'ritakriyAvAkyAh.

  

Case structure is another aspect of syntax which almost universally creates issues for any learner of any language.
