Here's one - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1kiiX5e9_o&list=PLOJKiO4p1ZRNHD5deVl-hZMVI7DmfNOZi>
.  

  

<http://www.digitalsanskritguru.com/> also has useful material, though not all of it is sanskrit medium.

There is just lots of it on YouTube - speeches by public figures, well staged dramas (example - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HFn7iL4T0A&list=PL63uIhJxWbgi13qnczu16t2Biv45mwQ4m> ), lectures on various advanced shAstra-s (vedanta, nyAya) and kAvya-s (example - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ban9cnVPWt4&list=PLofrqGxIuL6QuV4bV1s66fO8FOYeKz57v&index=5> ) etc.. You just need to look for specific topics, and keep an eye out for announcements in various fora.  

  

As to the language itself, good videos designed to accompany (not necessarily excellent) school textbooks used by some schools in India can be found here - <https://www.youtube.com/user/OnlineSamskrTutorial/playlists> . There are some kids cartoons and the like as well.
