 Dear  
 Colleagues,  
 I am pleased to  
 announce the appearance of my new book:  
 Boris  
 Oguibénine (University of Strasbourg, France), A  
 Descriptive Grammar of Buddhist Sanskrit.  
 The language of the Textual Tradition of the  
 Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottoravādins.  
 General Introduction. Sound Patterns. Sandhi  
 Patterns,484 pp., 2016. Journal  
 of Indo-European Studies Monograph 64, Institute for the  
 Study of Man, Washington DC.  
 ISBN Hardback: 978-0-9983669-0-6ISBN Paperback:978-0-9983669-1-3  
  
 Summary  
  
This book is the first  
 detailed  
 description of the phonetics of Buddhist Sanskrit as shown  
 in the textual  
 tradition of the Buddhist sect known as Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottoravādins.  
 The texts use the language which undoubtedly bears the marks  
 of Middle Indian  
 influence, mostly of Pāli.  
 However, as widely recognized, this language is not  
 identical with Pāli  
 or any other Middle Indian dialect. F. Edgerton’s pioneer  
 grammar of this  
 language (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953), which  
 he called “Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit”  
 allows only a limited space to its phonetics. The present  
 book contains an  
 analysis of the phonetic evidence of all available texts of  
 the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottoravādins.  
 Several of them have been published after Edgerton’s  
 demise, and their data had necessarily to be  
 incorporated in our analysis.  
  
 Special emphasis is made on  
 the fact  
 that this language does not owe its shape to either Middle  
 Indian dialect, but is a language on its own, with its  
 own peculiar structural constraints  
 and features.  
  
 Particularly, to account  
 for its mixed nature, all occurrences of sounds and their  
 sequences  
 are thoroughly examined with special attention to the  
 alternations taking place  
 within the texts and their layers, probably pointing to  
 the language habits of  
 the speakers of different Middle Indian dialects, which  
 contributed to the production of the  
 textual tradition that stood in the midway between  
 Hīnayāna’s  
 and Mahāyāna’s texts.  
  
 The intricate problem of  
 sandhi  
 patterns is also given much attention as it is generally  
 believed that these  
 patterns were subject to no constraints  
 whatsoever.  
  
  
This  
volume on the phonetics should be followed by further  
volumes dedicated to  
morphological and syntactic patterns of this  
language.
