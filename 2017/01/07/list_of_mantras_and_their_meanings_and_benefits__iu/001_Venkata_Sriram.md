Mantras initiated by one's guru should never be disclosed openly. The mantra-chaitanya gets depleted. the mantra shastra clearly says so.

  

Now-a-days, the so-called self-styled modern gurus initiate every tom, dick & harry indiscriminately without following shastra and sampradaya.

  

Currently, a self-styled swamiji (name withheld) is initiating his gullible disciples with chaNDi-navAkSari mUla mantra with online registrations and demanding guru dakshina thru

PAYTMs and credit cards. He is also offering early bird discounts !
