it is also seen that people just publish mantrams with meaning and all especially across social media.. We fail to understand that mantras are not just letters or words in a language.. though they may have that sthoola form too...and initiation of any mahamantras other that through a guru is normally not expected..  
Of course, I read in a text that even if we overhear a mantra at any time during our visit to the abode of Shiva, then we can consider ourselves as being initiated to that mantram.. But this statement appear to have been made to underline the greatness of Lord Shiva rather than as a rule for use of mantrams..  
If one is eligible for a mantram, the proper time, the proper guru and proper settings would arrange themselves, it is believed.  
But then it is one of the lakshanms of advance of Kali Age that we would be doing things which should never be done..
