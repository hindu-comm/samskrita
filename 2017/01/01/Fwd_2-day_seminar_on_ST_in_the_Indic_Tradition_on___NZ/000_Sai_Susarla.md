FYI,  
For those who would like to get a rigorous intro to Indic scientific tradition, there is an upcoming 2-day seminar at IISc Bangalore on Feb 4,5 organized by Prof. K. Gopinath. Eminent researchers (krta-bhUri-parishramaaH) will be giving talks on various subjects.  

  
Attendance is free, but you need to register by filling out an online form.
