Sathya,

  

A tikka being a sub-commentary on a primary commentary, is by nature is applicable to that primary commentary.

  

Numerous primary commentaries have emerged over the centuries, from the most ancient Yoga Bhasya of Vyasa, to those of this year of 2017.

  

You may start at this site which offers no less than six different *primary* interpretations along side each and every single YS. Sutra.

    <http://www.athayog.me.uk/sutras.html>

  

These belong to the main philosophical school, but there are others such as the one that Bhoja subscribes to:

  

I gathered this info. quite a while back

  

  

**Vyāsa line**:     Yoga-bhāsya of Vyāsa          \| Bhāsvatī of Hariharānanda Āraṇya         \| Tattva-vaiśāradī of Vācaspati Miśra       \| Patañjala Rahasya of Rāghavānanda Sarasvatī       \| Yoga-vārttika of Vijñāna Bhikṣu

**  
**

**Bhoja line**:     Rāja-mārtanda of Bhojarāja      \| Pradīpikā of Bhāvāgaṇeśa               \| Yoga-sūtra-vṛtti of Nāgojī Bhaṭṭa         \| Maṇiprabhā of Rāmānandayati                   \| Candrikā of Anantadeva            \| Yoga-sudhākara

**  
**

**Vedānta line**:   Vivaraṇa of Śaṃkara           \| Rāja-yoga                           \| Satyānanda

  

  

(A different) Six basic commentaries on the Yoga Sutra are:

  

  

Yoga-bhāsya    Vyāsa

  

Tattva-vaiśāradī  Vācaspati Miśra

  

Yoga-vārttika    Vijñāna Bhikṣu

  

  

Rāja-mārtanda   Bhojarāja

  

Patañjala Rahasya Rāghavānanda Sarasvatī

  

  

  

Bhāsvatī       Hariharānanda Āraṇya   

   

   

   Beside these, there exist a number of tikas or expositions on each primary text.

  

  

I don't know what insights you might be hoping to find in these tikas, but I can assure you that ***none***, ancient or modern, will make you any the wiser as to what exactly terms such as *samadhi* actually refer to.

  

While our minds are only around for a few decades. Our brain, that houses these minds of ours has been around unchanged for at least 100,000 years.

And while those ancient explorers have obviously uncovered all it contains, and told the tale - a detailed map of their discoveries is missing.

  

Thus we are left to voyage around inside our own minds to identify the 'things' those words refer to.

Our very own place is the one and only place where they can actually be viewed.

  

Again, that *samadhi* comes in not one, but four flavours, all apparently, being ordinary states, but.. what states?

  

Then there is the 'other' one - and most importantly -*how* to get there...

  

And that's only the first chapter...

  

  

So, we have to somehow stop the (inner) world in order to get off!

  

  to stop:

    to hold back from movement or action.

  

  It's right there at the start on YS line 2!

  

But...

  

  

Per ardua ad astra
