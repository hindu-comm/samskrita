Thanks for the info. The table with the different commentaries is helpful. It is a nice overview. I found a book which has the commentaries of Vyaasa, Vaachaspati Misra and Bhoja Raaja on [archive.org](http://archive.org). My intention was to get hold of original works so that I can clarify for myself the parsing of a few sutras.

  

Thanks,

Sathya
