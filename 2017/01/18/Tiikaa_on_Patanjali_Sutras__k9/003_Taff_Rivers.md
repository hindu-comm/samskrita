Sathya,  

  

Analysing written text strings often lead to ambiguities.

  

While their generation is subject to precise rules, their parsing is another matter.

  

Context is everything. The generator has access to the context - its in his mind!

  

A reader has no such access, and the authors are often not around to provide to explain things.

  

  

Such cases abound, as can be seen from even the best of analysers.

  

You might wan't to avail yourself of*The Sanskrit Reader Companion*
on this site <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/index.en.html>.

\- click **Reader**on the menu bar at the bottom, but you will need a few kilos of that elusive*mind stuff* substance to get you started!
