dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
A friend of mine is visiting Jagannath Puri. He can bring any rare or old books of the Sanskrit/Odiya language.  
  
Can any vidvan who has knowledge of the area point out any new/used book stores in the Puri area from where he can obtain Sanskrit/Odiya books, especially related to the culture of Jagannath Puri and the worship of Sri Jagannath?  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,
