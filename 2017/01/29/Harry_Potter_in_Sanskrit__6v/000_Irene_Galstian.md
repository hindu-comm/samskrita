I did not think of this myself, I promise. This is a question of my colleague's 11 year old son. I have Harry Potter in Latin, but no amount of searching turned up a Sanskrit translation.  
  
Have you ever come across such a thing? Or maybe other well-known English books translated into Sanskrit (books that this young man would understand)?
