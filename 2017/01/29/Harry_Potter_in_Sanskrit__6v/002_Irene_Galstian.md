Thanks, Taff, I saw that one too. Since posting the question I searched quite a bit more. Now fairly certain that Harry Potter doesn't exist in Sanskrit (yet). It's a pity: think of all the cute coinages that'll be needed to make such a translation! :-)

I think the boy's request is reasonable though: if he gets a Sanskrit version of a book he already knows, that'll make the book more valuable as a language study aid. Either that or Ilya Frank's adaptation method, which is also quite effective. Checked Frank's offerings, but their Sanskrit adaptation is available only in Russian.

Will keep looking.

If the members of this list see something suitable, please post your sightings.

  

Kinds regards,

Irene
