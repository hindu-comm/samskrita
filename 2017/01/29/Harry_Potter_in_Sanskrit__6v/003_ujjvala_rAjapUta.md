If the child has not yet read Harry Potter in any language then there is a problem as he might need to wait very long because the book is not yet translated into Sanskrit.  
  
Otherwise, if he as already read it and just wants to read it in Sanskrit, too, you can take your time and translate the book into simple Sanskrit for him.  
  
By the way, a number of plays of Shakespeare have been translated into Sanskrit long time ago and are in public domain.
