Irene,

  

 There can't be too many 11 year old's in the world that are au fait in *Sanskrit. !!??*

  

 However, as you would expect from India, *Hindi* versions there are, a'plenty.

  

 Here's a mono lingual example, safe\* to download:

\*but, be very wary of other such offerings though, many are hacked and will trick you into being ransomed etc.- unless you have one of them long spoons with which to sup.

  

 Hope this helps.
