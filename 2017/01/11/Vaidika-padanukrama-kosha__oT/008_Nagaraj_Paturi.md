Thanks aadaraNIya Siddhartha Krishnaji,

  

For clarifying your

To my question

your answer is

Hope you understand that my question was based on my awareness of this technical distinction only.

  

You seem to have identified the intention in my question since you said:

Now let us come back to the original question and your answer to that.

  

So your answer

  

> 
> > "I doubt that even in the principle Upanishads, which extensively use > the root word भगवत्, one can find the word in the same meaning, i.e. > in the meaning of ईश्वर," >
>

> > 

probably means that

  

'in the principal Upanishads, the use of the wordभगवत् is probably not in the meaning ofईश्वर"

  

My intention in this respect was not to question your view in this regard.

  

The answer so far to the question of the use of the word bhAgavata in the Vedas seems to be that the word is not found at all in the Vedas.  

  

So the conclusion based on this finding should be that bhAgavata is a paurANika word.

  

What remains to be seen is whether this paurANika usage has any connection to the usages in the principal Upanishads or not.

  

I thought it would be a study worthwhile to see in which meaning the word bhagavat is used in the principal Upanishads?

  

Where, in which instances. is it used in a sense that is neither of Ees'vara nor of Brahman ?

  

Where, in which instances. is it used in the sense of Ees'vara not in the sense of Brahman?  

  

Where, in which instances. is it used in a sense of Brahman not in the sense of Ees'vara?
