Dear list

  

Apologies if this question has already been asked. Are the 16 volumes of Vadika-padanukrama-kosha available for download anywhere?

  

If not all volumes, is the volume with entries starting with 'bha' available for download anyhwere?

  

I am tracing usages of the word भागवत (bhāgavata) in Vedic sources. I checked the digital version of Bloomfield's concordance and the word is not to be found there. I wanted to double confirm with the Vadika-padanukrama-kosha.
