6\. Introduction: Sacred scriptures comprise only 12-15% of all the Sanskrit literature available from the Vedic to the pre-modern times. Nonetheless, they form the bedrock of Indian culture and spirituality. To approach the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Gita not from a scholastic point of view, but rather to understand the living message pulsating in their words is the aim of this workshop. By plunging into the philosophy of these scriptures, by gleaning their symbolism, and through a focused understanding of some of the significant words, verses and stories mentioned in these scriptures, the participants can begin to appreciate the significance of the Vedas, Upanishads and the Gita in the modern day and how they can guide us in our day-to-day living.
