Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste.

  

As **Vaikuntha Ekadashi** falls on **Sunday (08-Jan-2017**), I am happy to attach a rare **Kavacham** on **Lord Vishnu** by **Lord Krishna** and retold to **Lord Brahma** by **Yoganidra**. This is taken from **Brahma Vaivarta Puranam, Krishna Janma Khanda, Chapter** **12** titled **Shakatasura Bhanjana**.

  

The sanctity of this kavacham can be seen by the elaborate **phalashruti** (which is lengthier than the hymn itself)! It mentions that **Goddess Durga defeated Shumbha and Raktabija and Lord Shiva destroyed Tripura by chanting this hymn**. It is also given that one who recites this kavacham never gets afflicted by any fear.

  

May We seek the protection of all our deeds by Lord Narayana in this new year 2017 through this sacred hymn!
