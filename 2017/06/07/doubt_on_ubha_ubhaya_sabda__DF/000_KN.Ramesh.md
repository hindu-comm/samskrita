Dear all,

  

उभ - ekavacanam & bahuvacanam are not coming in vibhakti prayoga; app and it gives only dvivacana roopams in masculine,feminine & neuter genders.  

Is it because the word always denotes two and hence singular & plural forms it cannot take?

  

उभय - Here dvivacana roopams are not coming when it is reckoned as neuter gender. Is it missed intentionally? If dvivacana roopam is there, kindly provide.  

  

Thanks

Namaskarams
