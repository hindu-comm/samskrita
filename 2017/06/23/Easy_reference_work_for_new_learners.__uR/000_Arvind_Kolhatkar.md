I have, on my hard drive, a book called शब्द-मञ्जरी which is an easy and quick reference source for those, like me, who are not very deep into the intricacies of Sanskrit grammar. This short book gives declensions of nouns/pronouns/numerals of all genders/endings, conjugations of verbs of all गणs in all moods and tenses, अव्ययs, and a few other topics. It is in English.

  

I have uploaded it to [archive.org](http://archive.org) for those who may want to download it (6 mb). [It is available here..](https://ia601504.us.archive.org/33/items/ShabdaManjari_201706/Shabda-Manjari.pdf).
