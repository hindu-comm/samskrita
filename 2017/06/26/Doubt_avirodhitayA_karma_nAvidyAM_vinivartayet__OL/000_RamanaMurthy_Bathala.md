Dear Sir,

  

I have come across the following verse in Atmabodha by Sri Sankaracharya.

  

अविरोधितया कर्म नाविद्यां विनिवर्तयेत्।

विद्याविद्यां निहन्त्येव तेजस्तिमिरसङ्घवत् ॥३॥

  

Meaning:Action cannot destroy ignorance, for it is not in conflict with or opposed to ignorance. Knowledge does verily destroy ignorance as light destroys deep darkness.

  

अविरोधित (adjective, past passive participle)= unobstructed;

  

Since अविरोधित is adjective, it will all the 8 cases, 3 numbers and 3 persons.

  

रमा (feminine, Nominal Base)-> रमया (feminine, Instrumental,Singular)

अविरोधिता (feminine, Nominal Base)-> अविरोधितया (feminine, Instrumental,Singular)

  

Since अविरोधितया is adjective it should be qualifying some noun in the sentence.I do not know which noun is being qualified by अविरोधितया . I assume it is describing either कर्म or अविद्या. But in sanskrit the adjective should have same case, number, gender as that of noun it describes. कर्म(कर्मन्) is neuter gender so I can rule out it. So अविरोधितया is qualifying the feminine noun अविद्या. But the cases are not matching here. The word used in the sloka is अविद्याम् which is accusative case where as adjective अविरोधितया is in instrumental case. Please clarify regarding the case mismatch.
