Dear Sir,

  

I have referred the dictionaries:

  

अविरोधित(mfn)= not refused (Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2nd Ed. 1899)

अविरोधित (mfn)=(-तः-ता-तं) Unimpeded, unobstructed.(Wilson Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2nd Ed. 1832))

  

Both mentions that अविरोधित as an adjective. Also meaning-wise, unopposed karma, indicates that the word अविरोधितया (unopposed) is qualifying the noun कर्म (action). But कर्म is a noun in neuter gender, nominative, singular where as अविरोधितया is an adjective in feminine gender instrumental case, singular. No where they are matching.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
