Dear Ramana Murthy

  

If Monier Williams (which is largely plagiarized from Boehtlingk-Roth) and Wilson gave you all the answers, you would not be asking such questions here. Such questions are best answered by grammar, and not by referring to dictionaries.

  

As Dr. Bhat says, please read all the responses carefully before arguing your position again. I have shown the full derivation of the form as applicable in this verse. Karttikeya has also given the correct response. What we are saying is that **here (in this verse),** अविरोधिता is not an adjective but an abstract noun. That does not mean अविरोधित is not an adjective.

  

If you still want to stick to your stand despite being shown the correct answers, nobody can help you.
