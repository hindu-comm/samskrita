All made a mess by the questions.

Firstly he had to understand अविरोधितया cannot be adjective of कर्म as the gender and case ending do not agree.

Secondly, in spite of disagreement, he maintained his position and continued his arguments. Instead he should have considered the use of instrumental and its meaning.

Thirdly, he could have thought the possibility of अविरोधितया from विरोधी - अविरोधी  
अवरोधिता, तया .. instead of ktanta suffix.

In the context the construction means by instrumental "because it (कर्म) is not opposed to (अविद्या)", like तेजः तिमिर light and darkness.
