Yes, M-W does showअविरोधित as an adjective. Let's assume such an adjectival form does exist.  
  

What that means is that there are two homophones अविरोधिता, one of which is a feminine adjective, and one of which is an abstract noun, got by different methods of construction. Once you see अविरोधिता, you must then decide (somehow), which of the two homophones it is. One way is to look at the grammatical constraints that the sentence imposes. If it were a feminine adjective, it must qualify something which is feminine, as you have stated, and such a thing is not evident from the sentence. If it were a noun, no such constraint exists. Therefore, it is likely to be the noun.

  

As has been pointed out, dictionaries cannot show all the forms of words. Therefore, it is necessary to look at grammar, the various प्रत्ययs and how they affect all noun and verb stems to be able to look at a word and reason as to how it might have been constructed.
