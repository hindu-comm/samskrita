Namaste!  
  
Please help me with understanding the following sūtra and term *tapara*.  
  
Sūtra 6.1.113 (105 in LSK)** ato ror aplutād aplute** \| Whole sūtra with addings: **aplutāt ataḥ roḥ ut aplute ati (saṁhitāyaṁ) **\|

  

Let the substitute *hrasva u* replace *ru* when it is preceded and followed by a non-prolated *hrasva a* \|  

  

Question is why do we have *apluta* words here? Isn't it superfluous here?  
  
Śrīśa Candra Vasu in his commentary for 1.1.70 writes: "similarly *ut* means short *u* only and not long *or protracted* *u*." If it true then words *pluta* are really  
redundant. At the same time Candra Vasu writes for 6.1.113 "Why do we say "preceded by an *apluta a*? The rule will not apply if a *pluta* vowel precedes it"… As I see, he contradicts his own above statement.  
  
Rama Nath Sharma writes for 6.1.113: "Why can we not block *asiddhatva* "suspension" of *pluta* with the help of *tapara-karaṇa*?** The *tapara-karaṇa* cannot block suspension of *pluta* since it has lost its strength after setting aside the long vowel "*dīrgha*"**". He asserts that *tapara at* means short, not long. It doesn't have any connection with *pluta*.  
  
Thank you.
