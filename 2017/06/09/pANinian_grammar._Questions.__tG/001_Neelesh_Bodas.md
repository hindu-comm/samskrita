See point (5) at <http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/6/1/113>.

  

The summary is that"अप्लुत" अकार is typically asiddha towards 6.1.113, so a situation like (पय + रुँ) + अ3ग्निदत्त is perceived as (पय + रुँ) + अग्निदत्त, causing a possibility of उत्व. To avoid that, an explicit mention of अप्लुत is done in this sutra, indicating that the pluta-swara is to be seen while considering the possiblity of application of 6.1.113.

  
Kashika says - "अत्र प्लुतस्य असिद्धत्वातुत्वं प्राप्नोति इति अप्लुतादप्लुते इति उच्यते" which exactly echos this.
