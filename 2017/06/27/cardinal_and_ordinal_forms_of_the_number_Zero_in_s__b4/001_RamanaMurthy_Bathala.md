Dear sir,

  

In physics, there is "zeroth law of thermodynamics".

  

How to translate "zeroth"?

  

The**zeroth law of thermodynamics**states that if twothermodynamic systemsare each inthermal equilibriumwith a third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. Accordingly, thermal equilibrium between systems is atransitive relation.
