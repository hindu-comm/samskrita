It means "Open the door." (As in - Kalidasa knocks on the door and says, "open the door.").  
  
कपाट refers to a door panel. I am guessing you asked the question in the context of why "भक्तः देवं वन्दनं करोति" is wrong. If that was the context, here's the difference. In अनावृत-कपाटं द्वारं, the former refers to the door itself. In other words, अनावृतः कपाटः यस्य तत् अनावृतकपाटम् (द्वारम्). There is no such relationship between देव and वन्दन.
