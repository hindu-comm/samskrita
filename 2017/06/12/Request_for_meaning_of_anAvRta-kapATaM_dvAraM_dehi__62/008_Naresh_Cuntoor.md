Irene,  
  

The short answer is Samskrita Bharati introductory classes followed by a study of Sankshepa Ramayana and a simple text or two.  
  
I'll elaborate -- assuming that one has at least a passing familiarity with Indian language vocab. If one is not familiar with any Indian language, I'll readily admit that I don't have a good answer. I make this fundamental assumption because the vast majority of Indian languages share a vocabulary with Samskrit even though they differ in terms of word endings, usages, phrases and idioms. The Samskrita Bharati methodology capitalizes on vocab-level similarities at the beginner's level. For this technique to be effective, the student needs to learn from a teacher in person for at least the first month or two. At that stage, the instruction relies heavily on interaction and immersion which is difficult to replicate in remote, text or tech-based learning. The instruction is completely in Samskrit.  

  
In some parts of the world, it is not difficult to locate a Samskrita Bharati chapter to get the basic lessons. This is certainly true in the case of India, US and Canada. I would guess that it applies in some measure to the UK (although I have no personal knowledge of it). I should add that I have taught several classes using this methodology and can vouch for its effectiveness.  
  

In this approach, lessons build gradually, but quickly from individual words to simple 2 or 3-word sentences to longer phrases. This approach sets up a good foundation. Then you go through one or two text books to build on that knowledge base. But at some point one hits a brick wall if the objective is to go beyond simple conversation and/or reading simple stories.  
  

At this stage, I have seen many teachers resort to translation, which destroys the work students would have put in until then. In my experience, this tends to happen because of insufficiently many repetitive exercises with vibhakti forms, basic kRdanta forms (shatR, kta, etc.), and conjunctive sentences using yad-tad forms. When this happens, I have found that Sankshepa Ramayana is a good text to study - preferably with a teacher. Rashtriya Samskrit Sansthanam has come out with an excellent practice text for self-study. But in self-study mode, I think it tends to hinder progress unless a student is disciplined enough to try to work on one's own before checking the detailed description in the text book. This is so because there is a fair bit of spoon-feeding and not sufficiently challenging to encourage thoughtful learning. (I am sure many will disagree with this assessment - I am just giving you my take).  
  

Sankshepa Ramayana works nicely at this stage for two main reasons - the story is familiar so that the student does not have to pay attention to how the story develops. Secondly, vocab familiarity again. The first 15-20 shlokas are more or a less a list of adjectives of Rama - a samAsa gold mine for practicing yad-tad etc. constructions in explanation.  
  

At the end of Sankshepa Ramayana, students are usually very well-prepared to study further. A few others and I have tried this approach a few times over with reasonable success. After Sankshepa Ramayana, classes have continued with various texts including Vetala panchavimshati, Panchatantra, several Bhaasa plays and a few Kalidasa texts. Throughout we stick to reading and learning with Samskrit itself.  
  

Long answer, but I hope this helps.
