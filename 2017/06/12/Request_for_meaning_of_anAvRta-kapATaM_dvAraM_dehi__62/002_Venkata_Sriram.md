My opinion:

  

अनावृत - moksha (liberation from the closed cycle of birth & death ; आवृत - closed ended (the cycle of samsaara)

कपाट - panel / door  

द्वारं - way  

  

The rough translation goes:

  

Pls bestow the liberation (ie., pls open the doors of liberation for me).

  

Something similar to the shloka from Annapurna Ashtakam vide **mokSha dvAra kavATa-pATanakarI**

  
regs,

sriram
