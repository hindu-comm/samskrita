Naresh,

  

This helps immensely. Thank you.

I am keenly interested in dealing with the brick wall stage, as you may have guessed, and several willing guinea pigs kindly came forward. I'll get Sankshepa Ramayana ASAP and see how things go.

If possible, please mention which Bhaasa and Kalidasa texts you found helpful in your teaching experience as next steps.

Once again, thank you for suggesting a realistic strategy.

  

Irene

  

PS After much furtive photographing, I have now scanned Aralikatti's thesis on spoken Sanskrit sentence patterns. Would this list like to have a look at the book?
