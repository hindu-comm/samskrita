Could you please elaborate on the 'gradual approach to learning'?

Difficulty in going from meanings of the individual words to the phrases, and then from the phrases to the meaning of the overall sentence is the key obstacle for Sanskrit learners. Once that has been overcome, it becomes much easier to pick out suitable entries from the dictionary.

As you state, this comes from practice. But practice of what?

For example, in pranayama longer kumbhaka comes from gradually prolonging it. It's linear in nature until we reach about 2min, then there is a qualitative change, then we continue.

But what are we training to better understand Sanskrit sentences?

Coulson dealt with the problem by offering a 'bank' of Sanskrit sentences and their English meaning. This approach has its merits.

But is there a way that doesn't involve English?
