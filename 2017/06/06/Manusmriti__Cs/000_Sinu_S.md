It is popularly hypothesized that some of manusmriti verses were altered or added on later. How do experts figure out if a verse is modified or not.

But vedas are claimed to be still unchanged. Is there any encryption method that VedaVyasa followed when he composed all the vedas and mahabharata ?

Is it known to us.?

  

Thank you all

Sinu
