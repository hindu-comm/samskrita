Hello Irene Ji

  

As of now, they are not available as ebooks. The OM Mala may be available as an ebook for Android devices by end of the year, but I am not sure.

  

You may get in touch with the publishers if you want to have the books shipped to the the UK. The Mahaviri is published by Niraamaya Publishing, a publishing house owned by my parents. The OM Mala is published by StoryMirror, a Gurugram-based publishing house. You may email me off the list for further details.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
