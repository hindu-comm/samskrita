Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for the reply.

  

In your reply, you mentioned " अश् (A and P 1)". Does "1" mean it belongs to 1st class?

  

I have seen अश् belonging to 5th class as per Apte's Dictionary.

  

I do not know how to conjugate verbs. So I use the website "<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/grammar.html&quot>; for getting the conjugated forms.

  

1\. When I mention that it belongs to 1st class, I get the correct form अशेम in विधिलिङ्ग् (first person, plural)

  

2\. When I mention that it belongs to 5th class, I get the different form अश्नुवीमहि in विधिलिङ्ग् (first person, plural).

  

I am confused here. Please clarify.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
