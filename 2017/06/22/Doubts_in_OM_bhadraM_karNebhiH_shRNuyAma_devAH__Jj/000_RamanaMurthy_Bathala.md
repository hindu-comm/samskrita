Dear Sir,

  

I have come across the Shanti Mantra:

  

ॐ भद्रं कर्णेभिः शृणुयाम देवाः ।

भद्रं पश्येमाक्षभिर्यजत्राः ।

स्थिरैरङ्गैस्तुष्टुवांसस्तनूभिः ।

व्यशेम देवहितं यदायुः ।

  

I have two doubts:

1\)

कर्णेभिः = with the ears (ear)

  

But कर्ण is masculine word. Its instrumental plural is कर्णैः .

But in the sloka the inflected word used is : कर्णेभिः

  

2\) व्यशेम = वि + अशेम = may (we) live

What is the tense or mood of the word अशेम? What is its root (धातु) and to which class it belongs? Is it आत्मनेपद or परस्मैपद?

  

I request someone to provide the answers to the above questions.

Thanks in advance.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
