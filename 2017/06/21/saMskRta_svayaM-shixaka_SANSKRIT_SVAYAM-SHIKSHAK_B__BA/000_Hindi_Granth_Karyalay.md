USP: Useful for those who want to learn Sanskrit through Hindi



The Sanskrit Svayam Shikshak (संस्कृत स्वयं-शिक्षक) is a book written by the versatile genius Pandit Shripad Damodar Satwalekar for Sanskrit self learning in Hindi.



Born in 1867 in the erstwhile Bombay State, Shripad Damodar Satvalekar began his career as a portrait painter and photographer in a photo studio in Lahore. Later, he shifted base to Aundh, near Pune.



Besides being a painter and photographer, Satvalekar was a distinguished scholar of the Vedas, Sanskrit, Yoga and Ayurveda. To this end, he founded the Svadhyaya Mandal in 1918, which focused on deep studies of the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures.



Satvalekar was a man with many strings to his bow. He was a renowned freedom fighter, a staunch supporter of Bal Gangadhar Tilak (who was himself a scholar of the Vedas), a Vedic scholar, a master of Ayurveda, a proponent of yoga for physiological and spiritual well being, and a practitioner of the Surya Namaskar. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1968 in recognition of his multifarious services to the nation.



We are proud to make this excellent primer for learning Sanskrit available to all lovers and Sanskrit and South Asian Studies.



This work and many other quality books for learning Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pali are available at our bookstore and through mail order.
