It was a marking artifact. भवतः उत्तराणि साधूनि एव ।

साधु । "भक्तः देवं वन्दनं करोति" इत्यस्य स्थाने "भक्तः देवस्य वन्दनं करोति" इत्यपि साधु ।  

  

(Just as दानं करणेन was wrong in the mantra..subhashita, देवं वन्दनं करोति is wrong.)

The original sentence with नमस्करोति is fine. There was no mistake to correct in that sentence. नमति is usually used. नमते may not be technically wrong, but given the lack of usage, I would stick to the parasmaipadi usage.

No. प्रियकथां is the correction. The point I was restating was that samastapadas should be written as a single word, and not with arbitrary spaces in between.  
  

(Had the intention been to use प्रिय as a sambodhana, then it would be fine. But that is not the intention here.)  

  
  
मात्राप्रिय कथां श्रावयति is wrong. But we'll address that mistake some other time.

No. सर्वाः प्रजाः, सर्वाः देवताः  

सा प्रजा - ताः प्रजाः  

सा देवता - ताः देवताः  

सः देवः - ते देवाः  

सः जनः - ते जनाः
