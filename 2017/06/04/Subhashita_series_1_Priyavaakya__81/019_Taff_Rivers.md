Manish,  
  
Microsoft stopped including *Mangal* with Windows about a decade ago for 'licensing reasons' i.e. it was never theirs in the first place.  
So unless the PC runs an old version such as XP or 2008, it will not be found.  
  
However, You can download any Open Source Unicode Devanagari Font from the net and make it the default Unicode (utf-8) font for your browser or mailer.  
  
Search for "Free Devanagari Unicode Fonts" in 'Google search' and you will find dozens of them.  
  
You might might take a look at *Chandas* on <http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/>  
There, you will also find software to design your own Sanskrit font, if you are feeling adventurous enough!  
  
Devanagari writers should bear in mind that recipient's devices should also be equipted with a suitable Unicode Devanagari font.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
 Taff
