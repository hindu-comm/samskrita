मित्राविनाश - वीक्षस्व दोषमिमम्।  
  
वार्तान्तरा - PS: abhyankara's sanskrit dictionary is almost entirely proofread and therefore ready for use in its stardict form (<https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/stardict-sanskrit/raw/master/sa-vyAkaraNa/tars/abhyankara-grammar__2017-06-05_14-22-30__0MB.tar.gz>) - barring about 28 errors which need to be fixed in the wikisource ( <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/stardict-sanskrit/issues/20> - please go fix if you can ) .
