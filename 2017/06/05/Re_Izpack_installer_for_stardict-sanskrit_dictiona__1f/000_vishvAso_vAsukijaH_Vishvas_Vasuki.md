(IMHO, the > non-tech savvy users probably wouldn't mind having all the > dictionaries if it makes the installation simple). With this in mind, > I've created an Izpack based installer for Windows platforms. This > requires Java, but that should mostly exist on typical Windows > machines. It unpacks a copy of Goldendict portable, then unpacks all > the dictionaries into the content folder of goldendict, and creates > start menu and/or desktop shortcuts named "Sanskrit Dictionaries" so > that it is easy to find later.
