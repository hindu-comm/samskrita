I already have GoldenDict working on my Widows Pc, but I tried to see if I could install these Dics through this new facility. It appears that it does not allow both versions to be working independantly. That is not an issue.

  

But I have been so far unsuccessful in installing the Sanskrit Dics on my Android phone although I have installed ColorDict App. which is working with Wikipedia and another English Dic. I have downloaded Android MW Dic on to the ColorDic folder alright.For some reason ColorDic seems to ignore its presence. Any tips to help me install MW Dic. on to my Android (MotoG3) are welcome. Apte dic does not seem to be available for Android.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
