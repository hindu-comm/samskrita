अस्खलितम्, ऊर्ध्वं रेतो यस्य सः - अस्खलितोर्ध्वरेतस्कः = like व्यूढोरस्क! Usage like ऊर्ध्वरेताः are available, but I too could not find the compound in the dictionaries. Roughly the meaning will be "one with uninterrupted cebacy" literally meaning "one who has not spilt upheld semen".

retas = semen
