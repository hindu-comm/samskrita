Yes, that is what I meant by Saakshaat + tvam; probably it can be further be split into saakshaat + tva + m .

  

Usual expression found with saakshaat is saakshaatkaarah or saakshaatkaraNam.

  

These expressions have saakshaat + kri .

  

Kri leads to the idea of role/agency for the bhakta / saadhaka in the phala.

  

To avoid that and to say that the phala is caused by Bhakti , here, the suffix tva is used in stead of the root kri.
