Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for correcting me.

This from Apte’s Dictionary.

साक्षात् (ind.) 1 In the presence of, before the very eyes, visibly, openly,  
 evidently.

 — 2 In person, actually, in bodily form; साक्षात् प्रियामुपगतामपहाय पूर्वं   
 Ś. 6. 15; 1. 6.

 — 3 Directly.

I was of the opinion that the suffix त्व can be added only to the declinables like nouns. Since साक्षात् is indeclinable, I thought साक्षात्त्वम् is made up of साक्षात् (meaning: directly) and त्वम् (you, nominative case).

If I add त्व to साक्षात् then it becomes साक्षात्त्व (directness) which is an abstract neuter noun. From this we can derive nominative or accustive form साक्षात्त्वम्, which is used in the sloka.



Can you please clear my doubt whether suffixes can be added to indeclinables to make abstract nouns



Regards

Ramana murthy
