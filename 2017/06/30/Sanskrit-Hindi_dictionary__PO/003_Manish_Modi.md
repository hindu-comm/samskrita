Dear Irene,

Jay Jinendra

  

There are four or five really good Sanskrit - Hindi dictionaries. Funny you asked for them now. I was just about going to send out a mailer regarding them.

  

Shall send you the entire list soon. But the best of the lot is the 'Sanskrit Shabdartha Kosha' by Pt Ishvarchandra. It costs Rs. 400 and is really very good.
