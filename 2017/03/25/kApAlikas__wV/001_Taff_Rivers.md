Irene,

  

==> Is anyone aware of material on Kāpālikas that's not in English?

Apparently not.

 Although *no written works by Kāpālikas are known to us*, this antinomian Śaiva movement of skull-bearers, who took up the attributes of Śiva’s frightening form,

Bhairava, was once very much present from Kashmir and Nepal to the Tamil-speaking South.



The earliest mention of Kāpālikas is found perhaps in Hāla’s Saṭṭasaī, datable in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE (Lorenzen, 1991, 13), but most of our sources on them come from the 7th to the 12th centuries CE.

Since we have mainly indirect sources about their doctrine and practice, *it is often difficult to separate fictitious or biased elements **f***rom what may be true in their descriptions.

          ** . . .**
