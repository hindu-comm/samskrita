Murthy &Aurobind,

  

 The given site may be in the same script, but it is certainly not Sanskrit, it is Hindi.

  

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the word चिक्रोडः (cikroḍaḥ) that it gives for squirrel, is not to be found in the Sanskrit language?

  

Indeed the content, incorrect as it is, properly belong in [hi.wikipedia.org](http://hi.wikipedia.org) not [sa.wikipedia.org](http://sa.wikipedia.org).

  

Taff,

  

 R & D person
