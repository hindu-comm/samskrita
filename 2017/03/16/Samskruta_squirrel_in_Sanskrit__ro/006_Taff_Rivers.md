Aurobind,

  

1.  The **content** of the Sanskrit version is (mistakenly) **written** in Hindu.

  

2.  The Hindi version gives a **non-existent Sanskrit word** for squirrel viz,चिक्रोडः (cikroḍaḥ)!.

  

  

Simply put, neither of the those sites give a meaningfull Sanskrit word for our squirrel.

  

While the wordचिक्रोडः does show up on various home-made Indian language sites, I, for one, have not been able to find it any of the authorative Sanskrit dictionaries.

  

Where then, (in any authorative Sanskrit dictionary) is our nutty Sanskrit palm squirrel to be found?

  

  

Taff
