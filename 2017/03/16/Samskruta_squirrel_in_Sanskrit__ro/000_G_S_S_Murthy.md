Dear scholars,

My apologies for cross posting.

I was looking for a Sanskrit word for the ubiquitous and indigenous squirrel. Apte's dic gives the following words:काष्टमार्जाल, वृक्षशायिका, चमरपुच्छ

I could not locate these words in Amarakosha. I would be obliged for any information about these words or any other word that denotes "squirrel" in Sanskrit.

Regards,

Murthy
