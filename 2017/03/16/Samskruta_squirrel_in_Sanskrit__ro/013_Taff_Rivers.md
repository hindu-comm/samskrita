Murphy et al.

  

 Indeed, the given work\*, does offer **squirrel** as a translation, with pointers into the original text.

  

I do find the**रोमश**romaśa, for which a Lexicographer in the MW offers:**• (ī), f. a squirrel, L.**

  

Thanks.

*However*, there is no way I can get that original scanned text\* to reveal its meaning in ordinary English.

  

And in order to get some assistance with **Sanskrit**vocabulary. I typed some text, Devanagari and equivalent IAST,

to avail myself of such as Gérard Huet's *Sanskrit Reader*, but whereas it recognises my **Sanskrit,**अथ atha and च etc.that's about all it reveals to me.

  

I readily and explicitly express my**Devanagari**deficiency and also my**Sanskrit**vocabulary.

As I am not schooled in this script, there may be errors.

   nakulaḥ kṁgilo'thauṣa kaśo romaśapuñchakḥ  \|\| 2 7 \|\|

  

  (To this untrained eye, I first read a वि as a चि, for example...)

  

  

Can anyone help with:

  

  1. the unsandhied sanskrit, preferably as IAST, and

  2. especially an **English language rendition of those two verses.**

  

  

I really am interested in obtaining a complete transliteration of all those verses. If you are aware of any such material, electronic or otherwise, do let me know.

  

Thanks,

  

 Taff
