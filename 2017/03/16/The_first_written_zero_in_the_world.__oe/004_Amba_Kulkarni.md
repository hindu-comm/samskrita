Dear Sri Kolhatkar,  
  

You may also like to read " Decimal System in India" by AmartyaKumarDutta in "Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures" published by Springer.  
  
This article deals with the antiquity of Decimal system, significance of Zero in place value notation, mention of zero, use of zero as a place holder, written symbol, and then zero as an integer, and the impact of place value system on Ancient Indian Mathematics.  
  

Thanks and regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
