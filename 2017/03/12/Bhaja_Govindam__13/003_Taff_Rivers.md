Vivek,

  

Re. Bhaja Govindam.

  

As the professor points out, there is no*authenticating*to be done.  

  

The proof of the pudding is in the eating!

  

'Chanting' is but a means to an end.

  

With the end in mind:

  

Just as we we learn our Gregorian calender.

  

 *Thirty days have September, April, June and November...*

  

The rhymic beat of the stanzas makes it easy to *memorise* the *information*.

  

It is though the *application* of that information, that the usefulness or otherwise of that *advice* is evaluated.

  

View Shankaracharya's advice for yourself\*, in this very recent biligual translation, his politcally incorrect gender bias not withstanding.

  

*The childhood is lost by attachment to playfulness.*

*Youth is lost by attachment to woman.*

*Old age passes away by thinking over many things.*

*But there is hardly anyone who wants to be lost in parabrahman.*

  

 Taff,
