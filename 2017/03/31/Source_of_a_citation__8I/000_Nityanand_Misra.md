Radhakrishnan writes in The Principal Upanishads, p. 52 (George Allen & Unwin Ltd, second impression, 1968):

  

Quote

For Madhva, brahman is the person in whom the qualities dwell in fullness, *bṛhanto hy asmin guṇāḥ.*

This is also cited in Vedantasarah

Can somebody please help by pointing out where Sri Madhavacharya has written this? In the Brahma Sutra Bhashya (if so, the Sutra reference would help) or somewhere else?
