Dear group,

  

I noticed that some versions of Gita are broken down specifically for chanting into 4 parts. This makes it quite easy to define each break.

  

But I also know that people read the original text and do the break down in their head.

  

Please see two examples attached.

  

Other than it being more easy to learn in the broken up way is there any benefit by chanting the original text and do the breakup mentally?

  

Vivek
