Vivek,

  

 As far as the metrical chanting of the poetical Gita is concerned, no phrasal breakdowns are needed.

It is after all a *song.*I speculate that the English *guitar*derives from Gita?

  

Anyway, I came across an article last year, entitled *Linguistic charms in Gita\**, that might be of interest, especially as the Gita is often used as a base text for learning Sanskrit.

  

  

Taff,
