Learned friends,

Jay Jinendra

  

Sanskrit is a beautifully evolved language and offers high standards of perfection. This applies to pronunciation as well.

  

Mr Abhyankar, you wrote that in North India, they pronounce 'strii' as 'istrii'. This statement suffers from the*dosh*of *avyaapti.* Not every north Indian does that.

  

From the broader perspective, there will be regional variations as to what is the correct pronunciation of certain letters. For instance, with the exception of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, theऋ is pronounced as 'ri'. But in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, it is pronounced as 'ru'.

  

If youhave studied Sanskrit in Varanasi, you will be taught thatऋ is pronounced as'ri'. If youhave studied Sanskrit in Pune, you will be taught thatऋ is pronounced as'ru'. Both places have impressive traditions of Sanskrit scholarship. It is difficult to say who isright and who is wrong.

  

Hindi, of course, is a different language from Sanskrit and hence the rules of Sanskrit do not apply to it. Modern Hindi does tend to add halantas where Sanskrit never did. Hence, Hindipronunciation is different from Sanskrit pronunciation. But this is true for almost all non-Dravidian modern Indian languages. Marathi speakers and Gujaratispeakers also add halantas where Sanskrit does not.

  

For instance, a proper Sanskrit speaker would pronounce my name as 'ma -nI - Sa'. But a modern Hindi,Marathi or Gujarati speaker would pronounce myname as 'ma nI S'. Thehalantaappears unbidden.

  

Regional variations are a fact of life.As Dr Kolhatkar wisely said, "...Marathi Sanskrit is markedly different than Bengali Sanskrit, and both differ from Tamil Sanskrit." 

  

Best regards,

Manish
