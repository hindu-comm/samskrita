With regards to your friend's natural interest in increasing the refinement (saMskAra) of his speech, he would do well to inspect not one but many different pronunciation practices, perhaps look at the shAstra-s a bit and introspect on how his pronunciation differs. Let him just look up lot of speeches and dramas on internet. Also, this set of audios may be interesting -
"[अकारे](http://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42275194921/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-1-introduction)। [स्पर्शवर्ण](http://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42275304138/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-2-the-stop)।[इच्](http://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42275475669/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-3-the-vowels)।[य र ल व श ष स ह](http://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42427396743/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-4-the-semivowels)। [अनुस्वारः](http://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42427477788/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-5-anusvara-the)। रवर्णोच्चारणे[चर्चा](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153080380537989?pnref=story)।"  
One would find that the "don't care about anything except what I'm used to" types are the most unrefined in pronunciation.
