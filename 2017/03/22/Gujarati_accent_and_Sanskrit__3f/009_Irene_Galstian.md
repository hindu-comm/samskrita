I suspect that the precise rules of correct pronunciation simply aren't widely known. Even something as widespread as the 'mirroring' of the vowel preceding the visarga is iffy. Release of breath is one thing, and forcefully repeating the preceding vowel is a different thing, it seems.

It would be wonderful if S. L. Abhyankar considers doing a correct pronunciation lesson on one of his blogs, with examples and references to original sources.
