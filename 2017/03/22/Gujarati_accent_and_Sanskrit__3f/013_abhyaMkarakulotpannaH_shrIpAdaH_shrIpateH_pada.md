आयरीन्-महोदये !

  

I hope, I have scripted pronunciation of your name properly. For a moment I was wondering whether I should script it as इरीन्. Only you can tell which scripting is correct. Once you approve the correct scripting, we all will understand you by the pronunciation inherent in that scripting. Strength of देवनागरी is in its being a phonetic script. Often times, it comes to mind that all over the world we should follow only the देवनागरी script. If color is written as कलर, the problem that its spelling in UK is colour, would get eliminated.

  

One major difference that seems to have happened in Sanskrit in its transition from Vedic Sanskrit to classical Sanskrit, is elimination of स्वराङ्कन-s. All of the 100,000 verses of Mahabharata can be read, even when there are no स्वराङ्कन-s.That does not diminish the importance of स्वराङ्कन-s.They are important in specific contexts such as Vedic texts.

  

Your suggestion that I should write something about the rules of pronunciation is a good suggestion, especially because writing the thoughts down will bring clarity to my own thoughts and understanding. And if uploading them in a blog-post will help others also, why not ?

  

Coming to your point on pronunciation of विसर्ग, my friends liked it when I put forth that अष्टाध्यायी does not have this word विसर्ग. Panini instead uses the term विसर्जनीयम्. I relate this term to immersion (विसर्जनम्) of Ganesha-idol at the end of the Ganesha-festival. We do विसर्जनम् of the idol, not by throwing it into water, but by smoothly releasing it into the water. Pronunciation of विसर्ग should also be smooth release (विसर्जनम्) of the vowel preceding the विसर्ग.

  

My recommendation to your Gujarati e-friend wanting to improve his Sanskrit pronunciation, will be that he should read more and more of Sanskrit text, say, the Gita itself. In many verses, there are lines, which are single words or are written as single words. The idea then should be to pronounce letter by letter, not worrying about the length of the word. Hope, this helps.
