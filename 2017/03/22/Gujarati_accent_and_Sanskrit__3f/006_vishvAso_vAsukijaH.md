The above conclusion is contrary to the opinion of scholars I've heard in the past. There \*is\* a high degree of standardization in \*expected\* sanskrit pronunciation (far higher than in most other languages including English). The sthAna-s and prayatna-s of each varNa is well specified in various "shikShA" texts, which agree with each other on most points, and which are referred to even for non-vaidika usage. I've heard an erudite scholar (sorry - don't remember the name) transmitting the opinion of another that "if you cannot deduce the region of origin while listening to someone's sanskrit pronunciation, he is speaking excellent sanskrit".  
  
Now, in practice, pronunciation often is degenerate - with different regional influences twisting different enunciations. (eg. non-saMvRtta ucchAraNa of akAra by karNATa-s, gya-ification of ज्ञ and excessive elision of terminal-a by northies, aha-ihi-uhu visarga-s etc..). But the ideal is clear, and the effect of refinement (aka samskAra) is easy to see in the more erudite population.
