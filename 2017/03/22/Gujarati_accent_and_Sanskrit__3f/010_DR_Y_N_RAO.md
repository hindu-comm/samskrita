I fully agree and endorse what Mr. S.L. Abhyankar said about Sanskrit Pronunciation. The so-called 'wrong' pronunciations could be allowed only in respect of Hindi not at all in Sanskrit. Though written in Devanaagarii script, Hindi(Users) violated many a Rule as far as pronunciation is concerned. I opine that if 'wrong' pronunciations are allowed in Sanskrit, they may definitely send wrong and negative signals as far as 'end' results are concerned.
