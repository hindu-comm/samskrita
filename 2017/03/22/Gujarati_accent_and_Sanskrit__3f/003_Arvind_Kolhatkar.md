It is like English spoken by Indians. It is marked by intonations peculiar to the Indian languages with which they grow. The Marathi English is markedly different than Bengali English, and both differ from Tamil English.

  

Similarly, the Marathi Sanskrit is markedly different than Bengali Sanskrit, and both differ from Tamil Sanskrit. 

  

I have heard Pundits from the Eastern regions like Bihar referring toखट् शास्त्राणि, a Marathi-speaking Pundit would say षट् शास्त्राणि.
Who is there to decide what is more standard?
