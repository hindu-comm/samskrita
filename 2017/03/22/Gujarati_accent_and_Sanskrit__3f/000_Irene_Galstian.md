This question is on behalf of an e-friend:  
  
How can he eliminate his Gujarati 'accent' when speaking Sanskrit?  
Can he buy a CD/DVD from within India that would teach the ideal Sanskrit pronunciation (whatever that is)? The explanations on the CD, if present, should preferably be in Hindi (not English).  
  
If you can, please reply in Hindi (or Gujarati), but any reply would be gratefully received.  
Thank you.
