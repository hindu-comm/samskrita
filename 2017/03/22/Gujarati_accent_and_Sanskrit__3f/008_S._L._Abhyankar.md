I totally disagree with this wrong signal mooted that there is no standard pronunciation in Sanskrit. The verse in पाणिनीया शिक्षा - यथा सौराष्ट्रिका नारी तक्र ँ्यित्यभिभाषते must not be taken as an open license for pronouncing Sanskrit according as one pleases.

-   In North India they pronounce the word stree as istree. That is
    blatantly a wrong pronunciation. -   They also pronounce ज्ञानम् as ग्यानम्. That also is blatantly a
    wrong pronunciation. ज्ञ is ज् + ञ not ग् + य. In dictionaries one
    can find ज्ञानम् only as a conjoint of ज् + ञ not ग् + य.

The powers in Mantras are not just by their letters and words, but very certainly by pronouncing with right accents. Pronunciation of Vowels has been analysed into 18-fold accents as अनुनासिक/अननुनासिक (2) ह्रस्व/दीर्घ/प्लुत (3) उदात्त/अनुदात्त/स्वरित (3). Note (2x3x3 = 18). Such analysis can be found only in Sanskrit.

-   Why would have ऋषि-s and मुनि-s gone into such minute details, if
    pronunciation and accents were not important ?
-   One should consider only those Vedic texts as valid texts, which
    have स्वरांकन-markings.
-   Even a grammatical text as धातुपाठः becomes valid only with
    स्वरांकन-markings. The grammatical name of धातुः गम्is गमॢँ. The
    ending vowel लृ has to be अनुनासिक (nasal)sound as dictated by the
    सूत्रम् - उपदेशेजनुनासिक इत् (पा. 1-3-2). The later सूत्रम् - तस्य
    लोपः (पा. 1-3-9) will apply, only if theending vowel लृ is
    अनुनासिक. Only then one would getगम् from गमॢँ.

When pronunciation is so much meaningfully regulated, how can one dare say that Sanskrit has no standard pronunciation ?
