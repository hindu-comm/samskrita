Bhatt Mahodaya.

  

Regarding the haimam dasyami kankanam, I heard a slightly different version. Haimam is of or relating to हिम (snow) and कङ्कणम् also means a pebble. (In Benares it is said कङ्कण् कङ्कण् शिवलिंग् होता है every pebble is shivling). And the challenger gave only a piece of snow and a pebble as present.

  

With respects
