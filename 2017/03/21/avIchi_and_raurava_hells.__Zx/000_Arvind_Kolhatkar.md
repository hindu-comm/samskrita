Dear Group,

  

Attached are two pictures taken by me ofअवीचि and रौरव hells from the panels of Hindu mythology carved in the Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
Manusmriti gives the names of certain hells in 4.88-90. Enumerated among them areमहावीचि and रौरव hells.

  

I would request experts to look at these pictures and explain exactly what punishment is meted out to the sinners who have reached these hells and what misdeeds have brought them here..

  

Also attached is a picture of a punishment in which the sinner has nails driven into his body. Which hell is this and what offence brings the sinner here?

  

I shall also appreciate any pointer to a Purana or any similar ancient work where all types of hells are enumerated and described.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
