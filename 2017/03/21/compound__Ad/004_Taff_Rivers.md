 Your initial quotation, exactly as given, is probably the one by***Adi Sankaracharya:***

***

***

***Prasnottara Ratna Malika of Adi Sankaracharya***

***  
***

  

 २४.  चिन्तामणिरिव दुर्लभमिह किं? कथयामि तच्चतुर्भद्रं।

     किं तद्वदन्ति भूयो विधूततमसो विशेषेण?

  

 २५. **दानं प्रियवाक्यसहितं ज्ञानमगर्वं क्षमान्वितं शौर्यं।**

    वित्तं त्यागसमेतं दुर्लभमेतच्चतुर्भद्रं॥

  

  24.  Chintaamaniriva durlabhamiha kim? Kathayaami tachchaturbhadram

      Kim tadwadanti bhooyo vidhootatamaso visheshena

  

  25.  daanam **priyavaaksahitam jnaanamagarvam** kshamaanvitam shauryam

      Vittam tyaagasametam durlabhametat chaturbhadram

  

  Q: Which is rare as the chintamani which turns iron into gold?

  

  A: Chaturbhadram (four auspicious things )

  

  Q: Which are those four auspicious things according to enlightened souls?

  

  A: **A gift accompanied by soothing pleasant words, knowledge devoid of**

**     arrogance**, valour tempered by forgiveness, Wealth accompanied by

     philanthropy (altruism or generosity) – these, known as chaturbhadram,

     are very rare indeed.

  

  

And as to the type of compound,

  

    **dāna, **a gift, is described as***accompanied by soothing pleasant words, knowledge devoid of**  
*

***     arrogance***, etc.

  

    So this too, seems to to me to be a bahuvrīhi.

  

    Does***Sankaracharya's***meaning, agree with the meaning as you undertsand it?
