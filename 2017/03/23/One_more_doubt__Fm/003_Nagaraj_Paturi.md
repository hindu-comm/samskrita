In one of the web pages , in the comments section I found:

  

The words “Dasharatha, Maa and Ayodhya” can also be interpreted as “MahaVishnu, ShriLakshmi and Vaikuntham”. This shloka, hence, also means  
Regard Rāma as MahaVishnu, Sīta as ShriLakshmi.  
The forest, as Vaikuntham, and go cheerfully, O son!

The shloka shows Sumitra knew who ShriRama was!
