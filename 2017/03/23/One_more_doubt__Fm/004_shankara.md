Namaste,

  

There is a legend according to which, Vikramaditya, once asked the scholars in his court to point out the most important verse of Ramayana. None of the scholars were able to answer the king's question. Vararuchi, the most prominent among them also failed to identify such a verse from Ramayana. He requested the king to grant him some time and went to the forest where he came to know the most important verse of Valmiki Ramyana, by the blessings of forest deities (vanadevatas). It was the verse beginning with 'Ramam Dasaratham Viddhi...". Vararuchi returned to the palace. King was pleased when he knew that Vararuchi was able to identify the most important verse of Ramayana. It is also said that Vararuchi gave 8 different interpretations of this verse.  

  

The above story is from a book named 'Aitihyamala' which is very popular in Kerala. The different interpretations of this verse are not given in the book. I hope learned members of this list will be able to provide different interpretations of this verse.



regards  
shankara
