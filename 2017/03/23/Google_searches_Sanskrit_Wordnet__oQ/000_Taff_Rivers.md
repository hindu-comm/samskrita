All,

  

 Those confident enough to search for and evaluate information for themselves, at least in the first instance,

may be aware that forums hosted by Google Groups, such as this one, have ***built-in search functionality***.

  

  

  Simply highlight a word or string of words.

  Then access Google's drop down menu with a right click of the mouse, or equivalent operation on mobile etc.

  

The highlighted word(s) can be in any script(s).

  

  mouse  mūṣaka  मूषक

  

  

Also of interest may be the ***Sanskrit Wordnet extention for Google***:
