I apologise for the sudden disappearance. I am in the middle of dealing with unexpected events in my life.

Raama, I owe you deep thanks both for the advice and the materials shared.

Since this thread is likely to know about Govinda Prasada Sharma's work, does anyone have access to the 1st volume of his LaghuSK set?

Sharma also wrote a one-volume all-in-one edition of the same. If anyone has seen it, please tell more.

I should be back in action after the 9th of March. In the meantime, thank you all for the input.

Irene
