Dear Naresh,  

I generally don't write on the forum because you cannot have a coherent argument with anyone with written text messages. I Appreciate your feedback. its freedom of speech I shared my experience and my opinion like you did yours. People who read this forum are adults and can choose for themselves.  

If you say this is an echo chamber where one should not say anything against LSK, SK and other prakriya works. Then a small disclaimer would do and people like me would stay quiet. What these videos yourself and tell me after how many years of SK and LSK learning a student have an understanding overall scheme of Panini

When the end goal is to learn Paniniyan grammar then it should be to learn the Panini way.  

You are free to moderate my message or prevent it from publishing or lock the thread.
