I accidentally saw this message today, its late but wanted to check if you made progress on LaghuSK. My sincere advise is not to waste time on SK and LSK methods of learning. Unless your bread and butter depends on it and you need to get a certificate to get a job. if you are learning for learning's sake, you should follow the ashtadhyayi method given by Dr. Pushpa Dikshit or other ashtadhyayi methods set out by great acharya's in India.  

Good luck
