in which it has been mentioned that the Dr Pushpa Dixit'spaddhati has its origins in Arya Samaj's 'Direct Ashtadhyayi Paddhati' Saralatamavidhi which in turn has its origins in Swami DayanadaSaraswati's criticism of Kaumudi paddhati and recommendation of Direct Ashtadhyayi Paddhati.

  

Kaumudi is not a non-Ashtadhyayi Paddhati. It organizes Ashtadhyayi differently and its versions Laghu, Madhya and Brihat have been organized for pedagogical purposes depending on the target audience and the final level of learning targeted.
