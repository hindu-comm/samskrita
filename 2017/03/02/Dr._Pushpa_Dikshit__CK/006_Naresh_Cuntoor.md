Sitaram,

  

Who said anything about echo chambers?Surely as adults we can have a coherent discussion in a textual medium.

All I requested was to watch the tone of your posts.

  

Instead of making sweeping statements, at least give a considered and supported view.

  

Regarding moderation - the primary reasons for moderating posts is to ensure that posts stay within scope of the group's purpose, to limit spam and to dissuade repeated questions.

  

If that is too much to ask, please feel free to remain a mute spectator.

  

If you want further clarification, let us take the discussion off-list.

  

And thank you for the links, I am familiar with Smt. Dikshit's lessons. My comment wasn't made without listening to her lessons and reading her books. It is certainly good to post the YouTube link though.

  

Thanks,

Naresh
