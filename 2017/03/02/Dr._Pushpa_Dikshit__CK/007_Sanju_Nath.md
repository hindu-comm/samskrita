Namaste,

  

Can we not resolve this by the examinations passed by the students following the two methods and the time taken? Or the students of Dr. Dikshit take a standard examination to show their mastery of Ashtadhyayi at par with the older, traditional method?

  

This shouldn’t be a debate or one opinion vs another, imho.  

  

Sincerely,

Sanjivendra.
