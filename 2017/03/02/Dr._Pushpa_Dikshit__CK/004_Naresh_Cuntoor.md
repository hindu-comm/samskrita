Sitaram,  

  

When posting on the group, please pay attention to the tone of posts. Re: " sincere advise is not to waste time on SK and LSK methods". These sentiments remind me of a thread from a couple of years ago from another of Smt. Pushpa Dikshit's students who championed the method with similar fervour.  

  

It is one thing to praise a method of learning. It is great that you found the Dikshit methodology useful. In the same breath, must you rubbish other approaches? -- And time-tested approaches at that. In your enthusiasm to speak for the Dikshit methodology, referring to SK approach as for jobs and certifications seems a bit presumptuous, surely?

  

For what it's worth, I find the Dikshit methodology tedious and too rupasiddhi-centric. If that is your primary interest, sure that might work for you. From a language learning/usage perspective, I found SK + Kashika+ Nageshabhatta much more useful (and kavyas of course). For word forms, I prefer the Brihaddhatu / Krudantarupamala route.
