Hari Om,  
  
Some time ago I read that at Sringeri they have Gita chanting classes. They chant each verse in 4 parts and make the class repeat as is the traditional way and afterwards get a brief summary of the chapter.  
  
They do one chapter like thy daily for two weeks and move on to the next one.  
  
It was claimed that in this way you can memorize the whole Gita in 9 months.  
  
Can anyone vouch for this? Is this the traditional and best way to memorize Gita?  
  
Looking forward to your responses,  
Vivek.
