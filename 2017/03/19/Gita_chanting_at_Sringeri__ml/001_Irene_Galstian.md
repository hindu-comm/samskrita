Gita (700 verses) can be memorised in much less than 9 months. Once you get into the habit of memorising every day with concentration, it gets easier and easier. For example, I once memorised Evgeny Onegin, and it took about 3.5 months.  
9 months is for children who learn by going with the flow, not because they consciously decided to learn. They go, sit in front of the teacher and just repeat. It's effective, don't get me wrong, just takes a long time, and not everybody can recite the entire piece after this: people get confused with the verse sequence, not the content of the individual verses. My Muslim friends report the same thing with Qur'an memorisation.
