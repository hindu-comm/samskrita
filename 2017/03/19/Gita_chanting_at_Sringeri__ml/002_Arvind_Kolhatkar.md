Dear Group,

  

It has been my experience that to memorize any work, especially a metrically composed work, it is enough read it aloud once every day. If you do this, within about 2 weeks you realize that you have started remembering by heart whole verses and sections. In this way a full adhyaaya of Geeta can be committed to memory in about a month. The whole Geeta may take more than a year, but the learning by heart is effortless and painless.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
