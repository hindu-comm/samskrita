नमस्ते  

I recent came across attached paper which has following footnote in one of the pages  

7 Professor Madhav Deshpande was kind enough to send me a message which he posted some years ago on the Indology discussion group: "A few years ago, one of these **Maharashtrian Veda reciters, Shri. Madhav Ganesh Joshi, from NIpani, published a book ‘Svarayuktaa Ashtaadhyaayii’, 1992 (Sadhakashram, Alandi, Pune)**. I met him in Pune and got a copy of his book from him. The book presents an accented text of the Ashtadhyayi based on a manuscript, evidently used by the Vaidikas. Interestingly, the book has a preface by Professor S.D. Joshi in English, where S.D. Joshi analyses the accent markings on this text, and concludes: "The conclusion I draw from what I have noted is that the manuscript which is obviously meant as a help for pandits during recitation does not strictly follow the paninian rules of accentuation, both as regards word-or-sentence accent, and as regards technical accent. But from what I heard from Mr. Nipanikar Shastri I understand that Vaidika Dashagranthi pandits like Vedamurti Ghaisas Shastri from Poona have assured Mr. Nipanikar Shastri that the accentuation given by the manuscript is exactly that which they have learnt for purposes of recitation."

I was wondering if anyone has seen this ashtadhyayi.  

I would appreciate if one can share or let me know where I can get a copy of this text.  
  

Thanks
