(The following write-up is a part of a much larger piece I wrote a few years ago in the Marathi discussion group ‘aisiakShare.com’. The piece appears at <http://aisiakshare.com/node/3355> and is called **­**‘विष्णुध्वज नावाचा लोहस्तंभ’ or ‘The Iron Pillar called Vishnudhwaja’. It summarizes the results of several research papers and is intended to support a hypothesis, based on astronomical arguments, that the famous Iron Pillar in the Kutub Complex in Delhi originally stood at the Udayagiri Caves near the city of Vidisha. I am reluctant to give a full translation of my piece here because my original piece has several pictures in it and unless the pictures come in the flow of the writing, they lose their impact. It is unfortunate that the format of Google Groups does not allow inline pictures and all pictures, of necessity, have to appear at the bottom.)

A British official. Fitz-Edward Hall wrote a paper titled ‘Three Sanskrit Inscriptions’ that appears in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 31, Nos I-V, 1862 from p.111 onwards. (This volume is available in [archive.org](http://archive.org)) He writes in a footnote on p.111 ’At Bhelsa, within the fort, I recently found a fragmentary inscription, built into the outer wall of a modern house, and looking upon one of the streets of the town. Subjoined is all that remains of a record of which perhaps a full half is missing:' After this he reproduces the available 10 lines in Devanagari, of which the fifth line is:

भाइल्लस्वामिनामा रविरवतु भुव: स्वामिनं कृष्णराजम्। (May Bhaillaswami the Sun-God protect King Krishnaraj, the Master of the Earth!)



This is a record of the temple of the Sun-God Bhailaswami which stood in the vicinity of Bhilsa-Vidisha. The memory of this temple is now completely lost.



The town of Bhilsa ( now renamed Vidisha) is today located a few kilometers to the east of the Udayagiri Caves, which hill stands at the confluence of Beta and Bes rivers. Beta is Netravali in Kaladana’s Meghadoota and Udayagiri is the hill called by Kalidasa as नीचै: in the following verses.

पाण्डुच्छायोपवनवृतय: केतकै: सूचिभिन्नै:।  
नीडारम्भैर्गृहबलिभुजामाकुलग्रामचैत्या: ।  
त्वय्यासन्ने परिणतफलश्यामजम्बूवनान्ता:।  
संपत्स्यन्ते कतिपयदिनस्थायिहंसा दशार्णा: ॥२४॥  
तेषां दिक्षु प्रथितविदिशालक्षणां राजधानीम्।  
गत्वा सद्य: फलमविकलं कामुकत्वस्य लब्धा ।  
तीरोपान्तस्तनितसुभगं पास्यसि स्वादु यस्मात्।  
सभ्रूभङ्गं मुखमिव पयो वेत्रवत्याश्चलोर्मि ॥२५॥  
नीचैराख्यं गिरिमधिवसेस्तत्र विश्रामहेतो:।  
त्वत्संपर्कात्पुलकितमिव प्रौढपुष्पै: कदम्बै: ।  
य: पण्यस्त्रीरतिपरिमलोद्गारिभिर्नागराणाम्।  
उद्दामानि प्रथयति शिलावेश्मभिर्यौवनानि ॥२६॥



Upon hearing the fame and wealth of the Bhailaswami, Mahakal and other temples of Malwa, Sultan Iltumash, in 1234 AD came down upon Malwa and, after demolishing and looting sevaral temples, carried the loot to Delhi. The description of this expedition is available in the account written by the Muslim historian Minhaj-us-Shiraz entitled ‘Tabakat-i-Nasiri and can be read in English translation of it by H.M.Elliot in ‘History of India as Told by Its Own Historians V. II, p 328.’ (All 7 volumes of Elliott are available in [archive.org](http://archive.org)) The relevant passage reads:

"After he (Altamash) had reached the Capital he sent, in A.H.632 (1234 A.D.) the army of Islam towards Malwa and took the fort and the city of Bhilsa. There was a temple there which was three hundred years in building. It was about one hundred and five gaz high. He demolished it. From there he proceeded to Ujjain, where there was a temple of Maha-kal, which he destroyed, as well as an image of Bikramajit, who was king of Ujjain, and reigned 1316 years before this time. The Hindu era dates from his reign. Some other images cast in copper were carried with the stone image of Maha-kal to Dehli."

Raverty’s translation of the same book adds the following:

“(Conquering) Ujjain-Nagari and bringing away of the idol of Maha-kal, which they have planted before the gateway of the Jami Masjid in the capital city of Delhi in order that all true believers might tread upon it.”  
(Tabakat-i-Nasiri - A General History of the Muhammadan Dynasties of Asia including Hindustan P. 628)



It thus appears there stood in the vicinity of Bhilsa and large and old temple and that it was looted and demolished by Iltumush’s army. That Bhailaswami’s now forgotten temple is what gave rise to Bhilsa as the name of the town. When we were reading Meghadoota as a text in college, our professor had explained that Bhilsa is a corruption of Vidisha.
That does not seem to be so. Bhilsa arises from Bhailaswami.
