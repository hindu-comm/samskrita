Respected Sirs,



In my view, an ‘anuswara’ should be pronounced as an anuswara. There is no mouth position for an anuswara. Only an anunasika (मुखनासिकयोर्वचनम्) can have a mouth position. Hence, there is no room for saying that it should be pronounced like ‘m’ or like ‘n’.



There *are* regional differences in pronounciation. In South India in general and Tamil Nadu in particular, anuswara before a fricative is pronounced distinctly as ‘m’ and quite often as ‘ma’. Hence a Tamilian prefers to transliterate the anuswara as ‘m’ – as the spelling of our own group shows. संस्कृत is generally pronounced close to समस्कृत and संस्थान् distinctly as समस्थानम्. For want of a symbol for an anuswara in English, the rest of the world prefers the spelling ‘n’. It is simha and narasimha (also amarasimha) for a south Indian and Sinha in the North.



Any language written in the script of another language has its shortcomings and cannot be as good as the script of the language to which the word belongs. The diacritical marks used in the other language script are of limited help.



Samskrita has earned the credit that it has a strict phonetic script. When it is so, to say that the same symbol represents so many different sounds goes against the creditable feature.



Pranams
