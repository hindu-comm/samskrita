Ken,

  

  The hoary old issue of a universal script, phonetic or otherwise, has been debated for decades.

  

At the highest level of government, at the lowest level of blogs and everywhere in-between.

  

Many schemesfor *'scheduled'* and *'non-scheduled'* languages have been***proposed*** ...

... and ***rejected** - for **obvious reasons******* - social, political, cultural, psychological, monetary, practical etc. etc.

  

  

Taff,

  

 Like the man said, 'If you has to ask, you'll never know!' iti Louis Armstrong.
