My friend Vivek asked me this question, and I have the same doubt:

  

I have a doubt regarding Anuswara.

  

If it is on front of any of the following letters does it take on the nasal sound based on the mouth position or does at always become an “M” in these cases?

  

यरलव

शषस

ह

  

Is anyone certain on this? The grammar books don't seem to address this.

Looking forward in hearing from you,

Vivek (and Jazirae)
