Dikshit's method proposes to teach the Astadhyayi in 6 months. But what's the starting level of the students?  
Is there clear evidence that Dikshit's method is faster?  
It's possible to teach the Kaumudis inefficiently, and the results would be inferior, or maybe it's taught well, but the students aren't keen on learning. But what if the Kaumudi path is taught well, to disciplined students? Then we get people like Dr. Bhat, from whose erudition and expertise we benefit regularly on this list.  
Is there an example of similarly-motivated students starting from a similar level, whereby one group followed Pushpa, the other a well-taught Kaumudi path, for the same amount of time? Did someone compare them and find the Kaumudi group lacking? If so, in what sense were they lacking?  
We need to make a distinction between speaking/reading/understanding Sanskrit very well and mastering Panini's technical apparatus. The first can be achieved with some, but not minutely technical, engagement with the Astadhyayi, which the Kaumudis do provide. The second is a specialised technical skill.  
  
Can anybody shed light on the above questions?
