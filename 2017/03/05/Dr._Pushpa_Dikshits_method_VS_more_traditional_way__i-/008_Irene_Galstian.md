Dear Taff,

  

Merely asking questions isn't being argumentative. And even if I don't agree with others' opinions, I don't embark on a debate just because their opinions could work for them but not for me. For example, Modi alphabet may be acceptable to you as a solution to rapid writing, but I wouldn't implement it myself. To each their own, no need to say anything.

I hope we can all find a way to communicate peacefully.

  

Kind regards,

Irene
