Irene,

  

  It would appear that you are seeking an evaluation of a particular teaching method in order to come to a conclusion as to a basis for action.

  In which case a set of criteria as to what constitues 'superior' etc. taking the characteristics of the learner into account, Characteristics that also need to be specified as part of said criteria.

  

  There again, based on the fruits of experience, there is the overwhelming feeling that your are simply seeking a debate on the matter. Debate in the sense of arguement i.e. that you are being arguementative for its own sake, not to serve any useful purpose?  

  

  

Taff,
