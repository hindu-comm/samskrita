Probably he is trying to see if a methodical research has already been done on the question initiating the thread.

  

----------------------------  

  

The issue I think is not just Kaumudi method Vs Dr Pushpa Dikshit method. It is Kaumudi method Vs Direct Ashtadhyayi method.

  

Just recently on this list Sri Sitaram shared the origins of Arya Samaj's direct Ashtadhyayi method in the thread with the title: "Laghu vs full Siddhanta Kaumudi"

  

Brahmadatt Jijnasu's Saralatama vidhi book and the method documented in that is a result of this inspiration mentioned by Sri Sitram from Swami Dayananda Saraswati , the founder of Arya Samaj.Historically this is a little older than the initiative by Dr Pushpa Dikshit.

  

Arya Samaj universities and institutions have been following this method. Summer Schools etc. have been conducted by teachers of this book's lineage.
