Hari Om Group  
  
Based on the recent discussion of Dr. Pushpa Dikshit's method of teaching Ashtadhyayi a questions came to mind.  
  
If her method is so much faster and better and also widely recognized why do many institution continue more traditional teaching methods as starting with Laghu Siddhanta Koumudi etc?  
  
Is there a benefit to study in the traditional and seemingly longer way over Pushpa her method?
