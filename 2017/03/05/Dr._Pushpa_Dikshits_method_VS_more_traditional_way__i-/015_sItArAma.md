To answer the original post -

"If her method is so much faster and better and also widely recognized why do many institution continue more traditional teaching methods as starting with Laghu Siddhanta Koumudi etc?"  

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard>  

Dvorak keyboard layout was scientifically designed- just using center row alone one can type about 3000+ words. How many times one really uses ; and ' in a sentence.

This is truly better and faster way to type - then why are we stuck with QWERTY keyboard layout. Well simple answer is society sometimes adopts certain things and is very reluctant to change.

  

But as always there are few crazy ones who try.
