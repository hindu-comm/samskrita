Dear Group,

  

The above phrase is commonly used in Indian vernaculars to describe an endeavor that is jinxed at the very start. I would like to know the Sanskrit source of it. Is it possible that the original phrase was not प्रथमग्रासे मक्षिकापात: butप्रथमग्रासेन मक्षिकापात:? The second version would fit in an आर्या as the second quarter because it has 18मात्राs in it.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
