Mr. Raajapuut,

The question is that would you add these(ॅ ॉ -> ă ŏ)sounds in Sanskrit or maintain it's holiness?

Devanagari script has already tempered it's holiness by modifying few Vedic Sanskrit letters.

Adding these sounds may retain English learners words pronunciations while reading Sanskrit news papers.
