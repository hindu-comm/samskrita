The Devanagari script, along with other Indian scripts, is indeed a scientific script. Devanagari is used to write Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, etc. Similarly other Indian scripts are generally used to write the local languages along with Sanskrit, in most of the cases.  
But being scientific does not mean that the script contains representations for all phonemes in all languages of the world.
