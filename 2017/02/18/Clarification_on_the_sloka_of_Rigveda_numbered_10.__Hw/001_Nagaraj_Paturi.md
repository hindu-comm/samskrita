Dear Sri Vijay Kumar Modi,

  

These are mantras recited as part of the marriage rituals.

  

In fact these are the mantras which stand as evidence for the exalted sublime ideas behind the 'Hindu' marriage system and as a counter evidence for the allegations with regard to status of women in the 'Hindu' system.

  

Soma, Gandharva etc. mentioned in the mantra are not human beings. Thus getting married to Soma etc. earlier, does not mean being married to other human beings earlier.

  

'Getting married to' or 'being married to' here, is a metaphorical expression, not literal.

  

Soma is the rasaatmakataa relishability. 'PooshNaamichOshadheensarvaan sOmO bhootvaa rasaatmakah' -Gita. Being married to Soma means the bride, as a female baby was a cute , sweet, little, lovable child. It is this cuteness, sweetness and lovability that is being referred to as Soma here.

  

Gandharva refers to the 'musical' 'rhythmic' world of experience.

  

Being married to gandharva means experiencing the musicality and rhythm of the inner and outer world by the child. You might have noticed children speaking musically, in lyrics and moving in rhythmic dance-like movements. This state of children is being described as 'being married to gandharva'
