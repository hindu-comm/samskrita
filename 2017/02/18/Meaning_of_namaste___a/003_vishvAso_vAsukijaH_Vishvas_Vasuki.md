There are multiple layers of meanings to one's uutterances. The first is the literal meaning. Then there are the suggested meanings, which are not directly said, but are apparent to a sensitive listener. For example, if I point to a book and instruct my son "This is sarasvatI", the suggested meanings such as "Hence it is sacred, and must be treated with respect" are unsaid literally, yet suggested.  
  
So, chinmayAnanda's sentiment is in the second layer.
