Dear learned ones,

  

 Many are the works on *samāsa* - what they are, their many types.

  

 
viz.<https://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com/en/learning-sanskrit-compounds-1-1/452>  

  

 The rules for producing them are spelled out in great detail in the famous work on grammar.

  

 However, their consumption is another matter altogether as *the English reader* is left very much on his own when it comes to their interpretation.

  

 Given that some ambiguous interpretations have to be recognised as such, can the experts give pointers to a methodical aproach to this task.

  

 Especially as applies to the *Darśanas* such as the *Yoga Sūtra* and *Nava Nyāya* rather than the myths and legends and such?

  

 The **Wikipedia** resources leave something to be desired (hint!), as do AI software tools such as **Morpheus**.



 Us humans remain having to do it the old fashioned way!

  

  Thanks,

  

Taff Rivers
