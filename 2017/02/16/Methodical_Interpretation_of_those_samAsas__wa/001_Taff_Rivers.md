All,

  

It would appear that to properly interpret nominal compounds (*samāsa*),

it is first necessary to identify the *type* of compound one is confronted with.

  

To so indentify, requires studying their enumeration as *tentatively* listed here (*corrections welcomed*).

  

But perhaps it is only necessary to understand the general idea of these samāsas in order fill out the interpretation with those little wordslike *of, for, from, and* etc?.

Exocentric & nipāta also lending thenselves to this instuitive approach?
