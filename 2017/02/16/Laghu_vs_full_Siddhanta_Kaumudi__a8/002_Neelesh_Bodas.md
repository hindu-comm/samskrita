Namaste.

  

Whether you should study Laghu Kaumudi or Kaumudi depends on what aspect of grammar you want to study.

  

There are three aspects of grammar that can be studied separately, which can be referred as "What", "How" and "Why".

  

a\) "What" - This is the most fundamental aspect, where we concentrate on final form rather than the प्रक्रिया or the reasoning. For example - "What" is the चतुर्थी एकवचन of राम? Ans - रामाय.

This is what is typically taught in schools.

  

b\) "How" - In this aspect, we concentrate on the prakriya in details. This is what Laghu Kaumudi covers.

For example - "How" does चतुर्थी एकवचन of राम become रामाय?

Ans: Using sutras like स्वौजस्,.. द्वेकयोर्द्विवचनैकवचने, ङेर्य:, सुपि च and others. (The prakriya comes in the picture here).

  

c\) "Why" - In this aspect, we concentrate on the underlying शास्त्र. For example -

Why does चतुर्थी एकवचन of राम involve application of सुपि च even when it contradicts the सन्निपातपरिभाषा?

Answer - Because अनित्यत्व of the सन्निपातपरिभाषा is demonstrated by the word "कष्टाय" in the sutra "कष्टाय क्रमणे".

  

So in essence, the answer to your question is this -

If you want to study prakriya, Laghu Kaumudi might be sufficient for you.

If you want to study and understand the underlying शास्त्र, Siddhanta kaumudi is your first step.

  

Hope this helps

Thanks

Neelesh
