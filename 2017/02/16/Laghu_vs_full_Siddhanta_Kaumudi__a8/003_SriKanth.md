I am no expert but when you asked what to read, I am feeling myself in your position. You said it right, if you are past middle age, then learning grammar is a daunting task or "falling into bottomless" pit indeed.

  

In my limited time, I have tried to study, memorize, practice etc over the past few years and my opinion is learning of grammar has to be a daily undisturbed task, not a single day repeat not a single day of study should be missed. It is said one of the famous grammarian (Nagesha bhatta?) studied mahabhashyam 29 times. That much effort is required.

  

So my conclusion is, again if one is past middle age or Sanskrit learning is a part-time one, then I suggest one can learn Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi, memorize Amarakosha as much as possible, Dhatu Rupani of as many dhatus as possible. And while learning one has to start using Sanskrit daily such as reading Sanskrit magazines, books, laghu kavyas. That gives a much better Sanskrit experience in my opinion.

  

After all, the authors of laghu and siddhanta kaumudi assume that you already know a lot of Sanskrit words, can conversate fluently and on top of that memorized the entire Ashtadhyayi. Those were the days when they thought Vyakarana is also one of the means to attain salvation (You will never come out :) ). The Rishi-munis have chiseled it so perfectly and now not even God can fathom the myriad delicacies of Sanskrit grammar.

  

Every nook and corner there will be a grammar rule grinning at you and making you trip to a fall. One Swamiji who is teaching Sanskrit grammar advised me to not get stuck in grammar and move on to read knowledge (of course after acquiring the basic abilities). I am following his widom.
