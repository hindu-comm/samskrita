Not sure about firing, but you have sincere gratitude from me.

What you said is very true.

Every technical task I have ever come across had its fair share of legends about its supernatural difficulty. But all is down to discipline and following an effective strategy. For example, can't learn swimming by practising once a month (insufficient discipline). Can't learn swimming by standing under the shower every day (ineffective strategy).

Kind regards,

Irene
