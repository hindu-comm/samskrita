I have given my guess. Dr. Rama has explained with his first hand experience of learning grammar based on the scheme presented in his post.

I have not taught Ashtadhyayi or learnt Ashtadhyayi during my learning.

I ask because modern students in India have the benefit of teachers like yourself to navigate Ashtadhyayi, but when Bhattoj Dikshita compiled SK this wasn't the case. His was the task of reviving Panini's system.

Simply because Balamanorama is not a text book but a commentary on SK. I would have suggested to learn SK with Balamanorama.
