For studying Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi, (especially for non-Indian or non-Hindi students), this three volume set of books are immensely helpful.

These books have more fluent detail in English and refers additional sutras though not mentioned in Laghu, to make the material easy to digest.

  

Though the cost is high, the effort put in by the authors is worth the buy.
