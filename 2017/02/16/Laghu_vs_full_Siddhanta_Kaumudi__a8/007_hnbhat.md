In this analogy, one cannot learn by taking shower daily to swim or jumping once into deep water one can only be drowned or flown somewhere by stream instead of learning swimming. But gradual effort in a methodical way.

Siddhantakaudi --- Laghu, Madhya or Siddhanta Kaumudi are graded introduction to Ashtadhyayi commentaries ending with Mahabhashya meant for Indian students. It better to follow graded exercise, though it may be a waste of time in practice for today's learners as I am seeing daily.

This my experience. I myself started learning Sanskrit with LSK and once you have you completed the method learning, it is easier the next step. Even for this, you have to learn conjunction and declension of verbs and nouns well in Sanskrit. Otherwise it is the same in any methods Ashtadhyayi or Siddantakaumudi. Only difference is in its approach. Siddhantakaumudi instruction of etymology of the words in graded manner through the Rules of Ashtadhyayi, where as Ashtadhyayi is code of Rules itself without any instruction about a word to be derived.
