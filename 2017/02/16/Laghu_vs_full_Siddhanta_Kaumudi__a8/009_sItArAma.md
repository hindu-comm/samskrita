I did not find in another book that gave a system of studies to approach these esoteric subjects.  
-------  
THE SCHEME OF STUDIES - Given by [Maharshi Dayananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayananda_Saraswati) in Satyartha Prakash  

  

. First of all comes Phonetics (shikshaa) by Panini. Parents and teachers should teach their children and pupils how to pronounce different letters in their right places, with the right amount of effort and the right agent. For example, take the letter P. The right place to pronounce it is the lips, the proper amount of effort is what is called full and the right agent is the tongue.  
  
Then comes grammar. It includes  
Ashtaadhayayi;  
Dhaatupaath(Book of roots),  
Ganapath (book of groups),  
Unaadikosh (Book of prefixes and suffixes, etc.).  
Last of all comes Mahaabhaashya(Exposition of the above four books of Panini or Patanjali.  
  
If the teachers and their scholars be intelligent, energetic, honest and extremely anxious to advance their knowledge, the pupils can master the Science of Grammar in three years, and thus become profound Grammarians thoroughly acquainted with the construction of every word – Vedic or Laukika (i.e., of ordinary Sanskrit literature)  
  
Other sciences are easier to learn. The amount of labor that is required to learn the Science of Grammar is greater than that required to master any other subject; and the amount of knowledge acquired by the study of the above books on Grammar in three years cannot be gained by the study of such books as Saarswata Chandrikaa, Kaumadi, and Manormaa, in fifty years.  
  
The reason is that the great sages have expounded the most abstruse subjects in their books in such an easy way that it is entirely impossible for ordinary men to approach it. The aim of those great souls in writing their books was to make the subject so easy as to be readily grasped in the shortest possible time; whilst the object of little minds has always been to clothe their subject with such a difficult-round -about style as would necessitate great labour and waste of time, on the part of the student, to comprehend it, whilst he would profit but very little.  
  
We can liken this to digging up a whole mountain and finding a penny-worth of gold; whilst the study of the books of the great sages can be well likened to the diving of a man into the sea and finding most valuable pearls in one plunge.  
  
Then let them read Nighantoo and Nirukta (books on Vedic Vocabulary and Philology) by Yaska in six to eight months, but not waste years of their valuable time over Amarkosha and other such books written by atheists.  
  
Thereafter they should study Chhandograntha (Prosody) by Pingala, so that they may thoroughly master the rules that govern versification – Vedic and Sanskrit –and be able to compose poems of their own. This can be done in four months. They should not waste their time over Vritratnaakar and the like books written by mean scholars.  
  
Then they should study the Manu Smriti, the Vaalmiki Raamaayana, the Vidurniti and other selections like this from the Mahabhaarat. The tutor should teach these as poetry ought to be taught. The study of these books tends to eradicate evil habits and bring culture. It should not take the students more than a year to finish them.  
  
Then they should study the six Shaastraas (commonly called the six schools or systems of philosophy) with the expositions of Rishis – the enlightened great souls, the true seers of nature – as far as possible, or in the absence of these, with the help of the true commentaries of other honest scholars. But before taking up Vedant Shaastraa They should learn the ten Upnishads.\*\* All these books should be finished in two years.  
  
Thereafter, they should study the four Vedas\*\*\* with their four Braahmanaas\*\*\*\* with proper accent meanings, (and finish this course in six years). The Vedaas should be both taught by example and precept.

I do not mean any disrespect you, I am sorry if any part of the mail offends you. I have a long way to go before I can reach to your level of scholarship. I am learning through ashtadhyayi style teachings available on archive and youtube. These two teachers learned grammar in the above proposed system. Its just a pure myth that ashtadhyayi does not deal with Shabda siddhi.  
  

First sutra is taught then Siddhi's are taught immediately. for example  

वृद्धिरादैच्। १.१.१

and immediately following siddhi's are taught - one from each row. And students are told to derive similar words until they get good practice on these siddhi's.  

भागः, राग:, याग:, त्याग:, पाक:, शाप:, वास:, राम:, काम:, पाठ:

नायकः,चायकः,पावकः, स्तावकः,कारकः,हारकः,पाठकः,पाचकः॥

शालायांभवः =शालीयः, मालीयः॥

उपगोरपत्यम्=औपगवः, औपमन्यवः॥

ऐतिकायनः,आश्वलायनः, आरण्यः॥

अचैषीत् । अनैषीत् ॥

This way after complete first Pada alone students get enough insight how ashtadhyayi is organized, that is mare 75 sutras and about 150 to 200 Shabad Siddhi.  

When entire ashtadhyayi is taught this way it is prathamaVrutti  

Then DvitiyaVrutti = Kashika is taught  

Finally Mahabhashyam.  

  
I have met many Kaumudi lovers who almost fell when I told them that first I was taught "घञ्" pratyaya - they shook their heads and said start with Laghu first. Believe me when my friends were doing RamaSiddhi I was memorizing ashtadhyayi.  

  
I guess these two schools of thought will always exist and give choice to meet ones learning inclination.  

  
With Regards  

Raama
