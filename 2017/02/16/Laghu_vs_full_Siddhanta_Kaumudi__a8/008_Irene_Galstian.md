Dear H. N. Bhat,

  

Of course, LSK is very useful, that's a given.

You said that you see in daily practice that the graded approach is a waste of time for modern learners. Could you please explain why?

In your teaching practice, have you come across students who went directly from LSK to Ashtadhyayi? I ask because modern students in India have the benefit of teachers like yourself to navigate Ashtadhyayi, but when Bhattoj Dikshita compiled SK this wasn't the case. His was the task of reviving Panini's system.

Also, Balamanorama is a practical and detailed book too, but it's rarely mentioned. Why is this so?

  

Kind regards,

Irene
