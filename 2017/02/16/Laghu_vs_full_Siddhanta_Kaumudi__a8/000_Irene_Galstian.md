Dear experts,  
  
I currently have a copy of Laghu Kaumudi, which I have 'mapped' by post-it notes in and can navigate fine.  
However, one of my teachers often remarks that I should get the full Siddhanta Kaumudi. Today he mentioned it again. Having glanced at the scans on [archive.org](http://archive.org), I am afraid that I'll simply fall into that book like into a bottomless pit and never get out again. During my 20+ stays in India I have never seen a learning environment that would use the full version; they all use Laghu. Please help me understand when should one consult the full version, and when the abridged version is sufficient.  
  
Thank you in advance for your advice.  
  
Kind regards,  
Irene
