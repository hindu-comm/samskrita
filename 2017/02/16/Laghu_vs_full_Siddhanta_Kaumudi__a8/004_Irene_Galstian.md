I can understand Nagesha Bhatta completely for studying Mahabhashya 29 times. When something truly majestic is encountered, no effort is felt, it's a joy to study.

Siddhanta Kaumudi arouses no longing in me, to be frank. Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi is a useful handbook, and I value it as such.

Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate your input.
