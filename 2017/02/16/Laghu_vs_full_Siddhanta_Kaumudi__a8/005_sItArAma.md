Irene,  

Middle aged or not one must learn Sanskrit grammar only though ashtadhyayi method. Even if you learn little bit, its much better to learn the right way. I agree to the part if must be daily task. reading for few days and giving up for few weeks is not the way to progress.  
  

There are sections of Ashtadhyayi if one learns those sections Grammar is not such a daunting task as Kaumudi followers make it to be. In the old days 3 years of dedicated studies were given to grammar - this is later year corruption that created statements like 14 years are required to learn grammar etc.  
  

All it Sangya sutras are all one place  

vruddhi sutras are at one place  

मृजेर्वृद्धिः। ७.२.११४

applies to 3 chapter pratyayas  

अचो ञ्णिति। ७.२.११५

अत उपधायाः। ७.२.११६

applies to 4th and 5th chapter pratyayas

तद्धितेष्वचामादेः। ७.२.११७

किति च। ७.२.११८

  

There are any such blocks in ashtadhyayi that makes learning must faster and easier.

I know i disturbed the hornet's test and will get lot of firing for this.  

  

Learn something new everyday
