Hi Taff,

  

Naskh and Nastaliq have nothing to do with Sanskrit.

  

Flowing Devanagari is not possible without joins and lifts. Despite that, it is a lot quicker to write in Devanagari than to write in roman.

  

Yes, I was writing Hindi film songs in Naskh and Nastaliq. The purpose was to familiarise myself with a new script. Learning a new script/language requires a lot of practise. So I used to practise writing it. How often can you write the entire alphabet? You are bound to get bored. So I used to write sentences and Hindi songs in Naskh and Nastaliq.

  

I read and speak Gujarati reasonably well, But I cannot write in Gujarati. As you say, it is both joined and unjoined.

  

I am now planning to learn Gurumukhi. This is because although I read Urdu, Punjabi in India is now written in Gurumukhi and not Shahmukhi. I speak Punjabi but am hampered by the fact that I do not read it at all.

  

Best wishes,

Manish
