Manish,

  

*"it is a lot quicker to write in Devanagari than to write in roman*."  

  

Really!

  

The language of interest being **saṃskṛta**:

  

For note taking, using the internationally recommended IAST (Roman transliteration) is as easy as abc.

  

**Compare and contrast** the number of pen lifts to handwrite***devanāgarī***as against handwriting***देवनागरी***

***  
***

***  devanāgarī*** by hand, on paper. (or on screen if you have a touch sensitive device.):

  Voila! ***three stokes*** and we have '**devanāgarī**'.

  

 Repeat for ***देवनागरी ...***
