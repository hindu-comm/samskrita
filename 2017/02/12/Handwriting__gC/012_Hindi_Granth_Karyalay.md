Taff,

  

The Mudi lipi, aka the Modi lipi, was a derivation of the Nagari. So was the 'Kaithi lipi' thus called because it was used by the Kayasthas.  
  
Marathi was written in the Mudi lipi before Lokamanya Tilak suggested that it be written in Devanagari. What a wonderful suggestion it was! It helped Marathi literature flourish and made Marathi accessible to those who know Devanagari but not Mudi.

  

Mahatma Gandhi had made a similar suggestion for Gujarati. Gandhi also published a few Gujarati books in the Devanagari lipi, including the excellent Jodani Kosh. But it was not to be! His suggestion was not followed. Else, Gujarati too would have been written in Devanagari, thus making it accessible to more people.

  

As far as Naskh and Nastaliq are concerned, they are scripts connected with Arabic and Persian respectively. But they can be used to write the words of another language. So you can very well write Hindi film songs in Naskh and Nastaliq.

  

In fact, in the early decades of Hindi cinema, film songs and dialogues used to be written in Nastaliq and not in Devanagari. Since most of the film starts, directors and writers and lyricists were from Punjab or were Islamic people, they were more familiar with Nastaliq than with Devanagari. Even now, older film stars like Dilip Kumar cannot read Devanagari at all. He reads all his dialogues in Nastaliq.  
  
I had a very cute experience of this when I published my first publication - DILON KE RISHTEY. My author, Padmashri Prem Dhavan, was from Punjab and did not know Devanagari at all. Back then, I knew Naskh but struggled with Nastaliq. Since I was going to print the book in Devanagari, I asked for the ms. in Devanagari.  
  
It is difficult to find typists who can read Nastaliq and type in Hindi. So we had poor Mr Dhavan dictating the entire ms. to me, and I wrote it down in Devanagari! Then we got a typist to type it up properly, and so on.

  

So please do not restrict language to alphabet. Or vice versa.
