Dear Irene,

Jay Jinendra

  

When I was learning the Naskh script, I used to practise writing it all the time. It is terribly repetitive and boring to write down the alphabet all the time. So I used to write the lyrics of Hindi film songs in Naskh (even though I had to resort to Nastaliq because Naskh simply does not have enough alphabets to represent all the HIndi words adequately.) It is a great way to learn.
