Dear Manish,

  

Yes, let's use that comparison.

Naskh/Nastaliq is connected, and we take the tip of the pen off the paper rarely, say to place the dots, or when we reach a letter that doesn't connect, and there the tip travels very little distance.

But Devanagari isn't connected. Yes, the letters 'hang' off the rekha, but notice how many times the tip of the pen leaves and rejoins the paper, and how far it has to travel. This slows down writing quite a bit, at least in my experience. Unless, of course, there exists some secret of efficient writing in Devanagari script. What do you think?

  

Kind regards,

Irene
