*Moreover, those who have practised devanAgarI, will always find it to read compared to IAST.*

*Same is true for those who practised IAST, they find devanAgarI difficult.*  
  

Thank you for your common sense.  
  
  Though the issue is for fast note taking ***by hand,***for which I have now worked out a simple solution for myself.

  

For IAST though, for most English speakers,who would be familiar with schoolboy French words with their accents, not to mention Gerrman ones,

The idea of the diacrtitic system of IAST is trully almost second nature, there is after all, an easy logic to it that is graspable in minutes.

  

However, **Typing** thesevarious schemes, including IAST, for public consumption is another matter.

I resort to the venerable ***iTranslator software***for that
(Actually, I helped to beta test the software for functionality before it came out).

  

 Best regards,

  

Taff
