Manish,

  

 I'm also interested in a *formal cursive* (flowing) system of writing the Devanagari script - as opposed to the*casual cursive* (joins and lifts).

  

And so I tried to find*Naskh* and*Nastaliq* in the Sanskrit lexicon. But my efforts were in vain.

  

As it happens, having spent time working in the Middle East (Yemen and Saudi Arabia) I understand that *Naskh* is**Arabic** Calligraphy.

And furthermore I learn that *Nastaliq* is **Persian** Calligraphy.



I assume that you weren't really converting the lyrics of Hindi love songs into Arabic, but were actually using a *formal cursive*sytem for Devanagari?

  

The nearest of such, that hit with Google is **Gujarati**, which, while it does have *some* cursive letters, the letters themselves remain distinctly unjoined.
