Just map devanAgarI letters to the place where you keep IAST thing, and use same combination to get letters. Now, devanAgarI is no slower.

And, check that for putting dots above and below, drawing line above and creating a slant is also difficult to write.

Moreover, those who have practised devanAgarI, will always find it to read compared to IAST. Same is true for those who practised IAST, they find devanAgarI difficult.

So, I think that Manish's words are correct for devanAgarI-knowing people, and Taff's are for others.

BTW, I learnt to use I-trans first on computer, then I learnt devanAgarI. So, both devanAgarI and IAST were difficult for me at a stage. Now, I mapped devanAgarI to I-trans place and devanAgarI is easy for me.
