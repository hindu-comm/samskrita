Dear Irene,  
Jay Jinendra  
  
When I mentioned Naskh and Nastaliq, I was merely trying to point out that we need to practise writing each new script diligently. You keep thinking of words and write them down. I found it easy to simply write down the lyrics of Hindi film songs. This way, I could practise my writing in a new script and not get bored.  
  
Devanagari is not connected. But if you write it often enough, you will find that it is very quick and efficient.  
  
When I compare Devanagari with diacritics, Devanagari is a million times easier!  
  
There is no secret or more efficient way. Just practise it enough.  
  
The beauty of Devanagari is the prevalence of a large no. of letters. And the fact that it is phonetic. Hence, it is very easy to write and very quick too. For intance, if I were to write my name in English, I would have to write six letters. In Hindi, it is just three letters and a matra. Hence, it is written more quickly in Hindi.

  

Those of us who write regularly in Devanagari, use a flowing hand. In my case, my shiro-rekhas are quite prominent and I write with reasonable speed and good accuracy.  
  
So just continue to practise. Trust me, it is easy.

  

Manish
