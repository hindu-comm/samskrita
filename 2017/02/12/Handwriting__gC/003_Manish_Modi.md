Dear Irene,

Jay Jinendra  
  
The best way to improve your handwriting is to use the books that Indian kids use to practise handwriting. They have all the Devanagari letters printed in dot format. When you connect the dot, the letter is complete. It is very easy to learn. The workbooks gives you plenty of lines for practise. If you like, I shall send you a Devanagari letter writing book. It will be perfect.  
  
Another method that I used, when I was older, in order to improve my handwritng - was to draw the shirorekha first. Then write down the letter. It really works well for me.  
  
Yours,

Manish
