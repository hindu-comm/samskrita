First thing I noticed you have said you have been learning for 7 years and you listed 6 sources mostly known. But the first source you completed only 2 out of 12 booklets. I don't know whether the same case with others.

Please complete one at a time and you could have learned well before this time. That is the right way reliable than multiple sources at a time.
