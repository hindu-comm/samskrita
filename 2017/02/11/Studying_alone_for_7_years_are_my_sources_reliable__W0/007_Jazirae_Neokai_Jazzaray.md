Thank you hn bhat, good advice, I think I should finish the Bharati program. Just to clarify, I did half of it (2 sets, not 2 booklets). I spent 2 months in Sri Lanka and spent the entire time immersed in them (back when India made us leave the country for 2 months as a terrorist precaution). As for Coulson, I read all of it and also used it extensively as a reference. As for Whitney, I referred to it extensively as well and covered most of it that way. I'm especially interested in accents.
