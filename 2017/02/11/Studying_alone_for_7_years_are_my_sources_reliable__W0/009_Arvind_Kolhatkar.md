I think you could benefit from Bhandarkar's - yes, the same one after whom the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute is named - two books on Sanskrit Grammar. These were used for several decades as textbooks in schools, mainly in the erstwhile Bombay Presidency and were immensely popular. They are available for free downloads at <https://archive.org/details/firstbooksanskr00bhangoog> and at
