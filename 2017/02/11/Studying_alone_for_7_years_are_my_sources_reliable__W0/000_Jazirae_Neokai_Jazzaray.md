I worry that I am learning incorrectly, creating my own language!

These have been my teachers, what do you think of them?

  

1\. Samskrita Bharati's correspondence learning program, sets of 12 booklets (I did the first 2 sets)

2\. Michael Coulton's Teach Yourself Sanskrit, 1992

3\. William Dwight Whitney's A Sanskrit Grammar, 1950

4\. Sir Monier Williams' Sanskrit English Dictionary

5\. website: <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/grammar.fr.html> (for verb declensions)

6\. online dictionary:
<http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=vidarzanA&script=&direction=SE&link=yes>

  

I appreciate immensely anything you have to say. :o)
