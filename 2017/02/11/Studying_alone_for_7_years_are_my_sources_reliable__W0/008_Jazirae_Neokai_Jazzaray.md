Thank you विश्वासो वासुकिजः! I'm so relieved to know they're reliable! Enthralled? Even with grammar being a rather dry subject, yes I am! I really want to write and speak. But I have so many questions and would love to have my sentences critiqued. Probably what I need most is to read Sanskrit, and so yours and others' suggestions and offerings are most welcome!
