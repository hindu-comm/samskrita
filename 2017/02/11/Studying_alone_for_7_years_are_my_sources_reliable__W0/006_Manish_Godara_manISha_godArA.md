\>Pl can you help me how to do the samskritha bharathi course

  

<http://dlp.samskritabharatiusa.org> (if you are in the US, this link should be useful).

  

Also, instead of 12 booklets per level, I believe now there is a single big book that is basically a reprint of those 12 copies in single copy (from what I've seen)

  

You could also look for the courses offered by Samskrita Bharati locally or attend one of the residential three-day camps (usually during long weekends).
