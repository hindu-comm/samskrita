If it's the 4-level Samskrta Bharati correspondence course, it's lovely. Lots of useful things are contained in the 10 or so little booklets they send out for each level. The only thing is, the level of Pravesha is more of an advanced beginner/lower intermediate than actual beginner. Then again, Nagaraj Paturi did say that Indian languages make it much easier to grasp Sanskrit, so maybe a beginning Indian student of Sanskrit is really not a beginner as such.
