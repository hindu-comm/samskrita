Thank you Irene, all of your comments are helpful. Thank you for affirming the Bharati program, I will finish that. I looked up Sanskrit Chandamama and it looks wonderful! Thanks for your kind offer to share.
If I can download them myself, I'll save you the trouble :o) I looked at Kathasaritsagara and it looks too difficult right now.

  

What do you mean by "the deck is stacked against you, until you do something about it." ? What did you have in mind? 

  

I'm downloading 108 Upanishads with commentaries by Upanishad Brahma Yogin. It looks like I can download the Vedas and the Epics and everything!
