I meant that when learning a language like Sanskrit several skills need to be worked on in parallel, and since you are learning the language as an adult, you can take charge and speed up the task by applying strategy.  
  

For example:  

1\. Unfamiliar script. To counteract, read every day.  

2\. Extensive vocabulary and sandhi. To counteract, first study the theory of sandhi in a grammar book. Then read a dictionary like a novel (I use Macdonell for that, as my Apte is really badly printed, and Monier-Williams is too big for my handbag). The goal is not to memorise the dictionary, but to teach your eyes the visual patterns of Sanskrit words, and to say them out loud, while you're at it. This activity dramatically reduced my sandhi opening time.  

3\. Grammar. This is a fact of life. Memorising paradigms and talking to oneself in Sanskrit works well. Model sentences are given in the Samskrta Bharati course: first repeat the given sentences until they roll of the tongue smoothly, then create your own sentences by substitution, then keep saying them again and again, until you say them without hesitation and thinking. If you are lucky and have access to a fluent speaker of Sanskrit, listen to their intontation and copy it mercilessly.  

4\. Potentially strange syntax. Samskrta Bharati course can really help with this, but if you are a native speaker of an Indian laguage you may not have this problem.  

5\. Usage/style, i.e. how to speak and write Sanskrit without sounding like you've escaped from the 7th century. I don't know how to solve this one yet, working on it. If you know how to solve it, please share.  
  

Hope this makes some sense. Best of luck with the study. Write if you want me to share any files.
