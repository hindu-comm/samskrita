Reading kavya on your own just like that needs a fair bit of staying power. I tried that and in the beginning spent about an hour per verse just on undoing sandhi because I knew very few words. In the beginning the greatest use I found for kavya was reading Mahabharata without understanding, to train myself to read Devanagari well, and to listen to the rhythm of the sounds. I did that for about 20-30 mins every day. This may sound odd, but it was time well spent. If you are reading an unfamiliar script, and the language has rich morphology and unexpected syntax, then the deck is stacked against you, until you do something about it. I see this again and again with my Russian learners.

  

There exist assisted readings, like Monier-Williams' Nalopakhyana, Scharf's Ramopakhyana, and Sargeant's Gita. They are helpful to an extent, but I found that it's better to start with a simpler but unassisted Sanskrit, so you're facing pages of Devanagari-only text, and it's up to you to come to terms with that text. If you're not thrown out of the nest, it'll always be scary to fly on your own.

  

As a source of simple unadapted texts, I can offer Sanskrit Chandamama for 1984-2000, give or take a few issues. Straightforward language, goes well with tea/short breaks at work. Can share PDFs.

  

I also found Kathasaritsagara enjoyable. I don't have a PDF of that, but can scan my copy little by little, or you could get your own here, for example:

Maurer's and Aklujkar's textbooks are useful. I didn't get along with Coulson (lost the will to live). But anyway, whichever textbook you take, the Samskrta Bharati booklets still have a lot going for them.
