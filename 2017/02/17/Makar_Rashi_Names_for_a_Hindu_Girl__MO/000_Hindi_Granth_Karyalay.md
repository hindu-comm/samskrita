Dear friends,

  

I apologise for this off topic post.

  

My friend has just given birth to a baby girl. She needs to name the child in the next 15 days. The girl has been born in the Makar Rashi. Hence, we are looking at names that begin with 'kha' or 'ja'.

  

I would have thought 'Katyayani' is perfect. But it does not come under the ambit of 'kha'.

  

Right now, we have come up with 'Jayavardhini'. It is a lovely name but a bit long.

  

Could any of the learned folks on this list help suggest a really nice Sanskrit based name for a girl child, beginning with 'kha' and 'ja'.

  

Thank you.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
