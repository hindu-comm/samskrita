namaste!

  

Some major updates to the <https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/dictionaries>dictionary collection (available on your phones via[Stardict Dictionary Installer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sanskritcode.sanskritdictionaryupdater)and[pydictupdater](https://github.com/nangia/pydictupdater)).

  

Dictionaries should now take up less space on your mobile devices. I observed peoples' hesitance due to lack of memory on phones. (You will have to clean up the old files manually, or use the new version of[Stardict Dictionary Installer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sanskritcode.sanskritdictionaryupdater)available tomorrow.)

I've added very useful (esp. declension) dictionaries from <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/goldendict.html> . (I plan to improve upon them further - to easily lookup subanta-s as well.)  

A small fraction of abhyankara's grammar dictionary has been proofread - words from there are also now available.

A couple of renamings, which will require manual cleanup if you use the app to get your dictionaries:

-   PuraNa_encyclopedia.idx => purANa-encyclopedia.idx -   dhatupatha-sa.idx => dhAtupATha-sa.idx

Similar changes have been made in kannada, telugu, pALi, hindI dicts as well
