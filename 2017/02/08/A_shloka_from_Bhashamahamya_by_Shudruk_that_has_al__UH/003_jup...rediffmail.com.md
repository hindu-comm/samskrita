You might be interested to know of an entirely different pangram, composed “live” in a public assembly, by Manavalli Gangadhara Sastri (1854–1914), See attached .pdf file. Instead of using all 4 lines of a verse in śloka metre (4×8 syllables), he's used the last 3 lines of a verse in upendravajrā metre (3×11 syllables). So not only is an “ordered pangram” possible; multiple ones are.
