ak47 & hn bhat,

  

 The download problem would appear to be local to ak47?

  

 On this technical issue I was able to download and unzip, without problems.

  

  Perhaps ak47 could try another round by downloading another .zip file from another site?  

-     On a PC,  
-     directly from the internet,  
-     clear of any home networks, wi-fI, bluetooth etc.  

 Cheers,

  

Taff Rivers
