Namo Nama:

  

Is there a quote or subhashita on water conservation. I need for teaching small children about not wasting water and conserving it.

  

I think in the ancient times, they never had these modern miseries such as water scarcity and really had to conserve water, I don't know.

  

Dhanyavada:

Srikanth.
