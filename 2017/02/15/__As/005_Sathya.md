I saw this classification in vyAkhyAsudhA by bhAnuji dIxita edited by Pt. vAsudeva laxmaNa paNashikara, chaukhambaa press. I have included images of the two relevant pages.

  

Correction the names from शाक्यमुनिः to मायादेवीसुतः are classified as the names of shAkya.

Who classified this way? Which commentary or translation? To me they seem a single lot.
