The context is very simple.  
A man asks a question and ādi śankarācārya replies.  
  
  

त्वरितं किं कर्तव्यं विदुषां? संसारसंततिच्छेदः।

 किं मोक्षतरोर्बीजं? सम्यग्ज्ञानं क्रियासिद्धम् ॥

  
I'm trying to practice with Sanskrit,  
but I saw that this verse has different translations:  
  

- It is the right knowledge, shown in practice  
- Proper knowledge, acquired through action.  
- True knowledge which is put to actual practice

  
  
So I wanted to understand if these translations are all correct.  
  

thanks
