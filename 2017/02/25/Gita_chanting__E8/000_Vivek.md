Hari Om,  
  
I'm interested in properly learning to chant the Bhagavad Gita.  
  
I have a good recording my Vedic scholars to follow.  
  
But I doubt if that will be enough to properly learn to chant the Gita.  
  
Is there a good article or video series that goes into detail of how to properly chant it as to where to put pauses and how to break things down etc?  
  
Much appreciated,  
Vivek.
