<https://github.com/aupasana/ashtadhyayi/tree/master/tattvabodhini>  
has tattvabodhinI commentary for all pAdas except 6.2  

  

It seems that the source from which the data was derived lacked 6.2, as can be seen from discussion at <https://github.com/aupasana/ashtadhyayi/issues/2>.  
  

I would be grateful if some scholar whose copy has this missing 6.2 pAda can send it across.  
  

Best regards,
