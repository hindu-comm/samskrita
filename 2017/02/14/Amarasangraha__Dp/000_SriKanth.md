To memorize Amarakosha is a daunting task especially if we missed to do the effort in childhood. This particular book Amarasangraha helps to alleviate that problem by providing the shlokas from Amarakosha with the most used words.

The original Amarakosha has over 2500 Shlokas and this one lists about 650 of the shlokas from the original. I recently started studying this and I find it useful and sharing here in public interest.

  

dhanyavadA:

Srikanth.
