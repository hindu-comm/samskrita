ON GITA JAYANTI

  

<http://www.navelgazing.net/2017/11/on-gita-jayanti.html>

  

After the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita is the best-known religious text of the Hindus. Said to be all the knowledge in the universe conveyed in the form of a dialogue between Yogeshvara Krishna and his friend Arjuna, the Gita was revealed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra on the 11th day of the brighter half of the month of Margashirsha.

  

Over the centuries, the Gita has been translated thousands of times, into numerous different languages, each version interpreting and translating the text in a unique way.

  

We are proud to offer a collection of the most meaningful works on the Gita:
