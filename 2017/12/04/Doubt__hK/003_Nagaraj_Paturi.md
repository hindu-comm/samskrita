unnata is not an independent word in unnatas'ikharah

  

It is part of a compound (samaasa)

  

It has no visarga at the end of it.

  

As a part of a comound, it does not take the linga vibhakti vachana pratyayas. Those pratyayas get manifest in vigrahavaakya. When they get manifest in vigrahavaakya, the word unnata gets the linga , vibhakti and vachana pratyayas of the uttarapada (the second component word of the compound) as demanded by the agreement rules of Sanskrit.
