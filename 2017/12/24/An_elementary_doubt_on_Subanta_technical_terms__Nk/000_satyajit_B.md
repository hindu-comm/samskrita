Dear learned Sirs,

  

Kindly excuse me for the following doubt, which may be elementary

  

When one refers to Subanta, one has the following:

  

सु  औ  जस् up until

  

िङ् (sorry cant depict correctly ) ओस्  सुप्

  

  

When one relates these to राम up to द्वितीया द्विवचन one can connect, but द्वितीया [ब.व.is](http://xn--p2b.xn--y2b.is) रामान् while the depiction is शस् ( So is तृ ए वचन टा while we have रामेण ) and further ahead.

  

how does one relate? Or is one not supposed to relate this to nouns. Then, how does one use these in one;s studies?

  

Once again sorry for an elementary question.

  

Shall be obliged for guidance.

  

Thanks and respects to the members of the learned group..

  

Satyajita
