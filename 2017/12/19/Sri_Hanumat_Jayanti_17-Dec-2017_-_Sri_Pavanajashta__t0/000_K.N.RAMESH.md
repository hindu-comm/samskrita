Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. It has been a while since my last post and it has been difficult to find personal time and apologies.

  

As tomorrow is **Sri Hanumat Jayanti (17-Dec-2017),** I am delighted to attach a very sweet 8-stanza prayer which shall bestow annihilation of all sins and enhancement of **Punya**, comforts and wealth as per the brief **Phalashruti**. Though I normally endeavor to share hymns which are hitherto not widely shared, this perhaps does not belong to that category.

  

Incidentally, **Saturn** transits into **Sagittarius** a couple of days later (19-Dec-2017) as per one tradition and therefore prayers to **Lord Hanuman** will be apt for both occasions. Worship of **Lord Hanuman** shall be an indefatigable armor for those **Saturn's Gochara** turns adverse (1,2, 4, 7,8, 12 houses) May we pray to Lord Hanuman and seek His blessings.

  

May I also take this occasion to wish you all a **very happy new year 2018** as I will be traveling for the next couple of weeks. May the new year 2018 be the best one you have always dreamt of in all the dimensions of your life.
