Ken,  
  
In Classical Sanskrit, when -न् is followed by an initial ल्- it is changed to a nasalized ल् by regressive assimilation, and the nasalization  
(left over from the -न् ) is indicated by the Chandrabindu.  
  
In Vedic Sanskrit, it is used instead of anusvara to represent the sound anunaasika when the next word starts with a vowel.  
It usually occurs where in earlier times a word ended in -ans.
