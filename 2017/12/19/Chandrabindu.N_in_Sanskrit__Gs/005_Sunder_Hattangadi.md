candrabindu diacritic is used in sanskrit only in "sasvara veda" texts to *facilitate* chanting

for reference .

  

It is best to learn vedic chanting orally only, and never through written texts.

  

I am not qualified to opine on its use in Hindi.

Sundar,

*Do you see Chandrabindu in Sanskrit texts if not why introduce in Hindi? Also transliteration ruins other regional languages.*

Nasalization and pitch accents are written in Devanagar ¯ ¯ı with additional

diacritics. Nasalization is written by a half-moon plus dot (candrabindu)

over the vertical bar of the nasalized sound (e. g. ta;\<a;(ãÉ

a ta¯˜sca ´ ). The

accentual systems of Vedic schools vary. The most widely used, the R

˚

gvedic

accentual system, generally places a horizontal stroke beneath the

CV portion of an orthographic syllable that includes a low-pitched vowel

(anudatta ¯ ) (e. g. k!), and a vertical stroke above the CV portion of an orthographic

syllable that includes a circumflexed vowel (svarita) (e. g. k ).

Short and long aggravated svaritas (kampa) use the numerals 1 and 3 in

addition (nya1 !; :Sya;e!a3 !). The high pitch (udatta ¯ ) is left unmarked. Other

accentual systems employ additional diacritics, including various signs

above, below, to the left, to the right, through the middle of, and around

the CV portion of an orthographic syllable that includes a circumflexed

vowel; within a given system, various signs differentiate particular types

of circumflex accent. Diacritics added to the visarga symbol indicate

high pitch, low pitch, or circumflex.22
