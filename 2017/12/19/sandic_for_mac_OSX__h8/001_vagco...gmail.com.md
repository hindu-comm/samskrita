These instructions in the earlier mail wouldn't work, as they require QT dependencies.

  

I have created .dmg file for OSX with all dependencies and sandic.db. This will work on Sierra (tested) and High Sierra (not tested). You can try it on El Captain. I am not sure.

  

  

Please download it from here. This includes sandic.db as well. Copy it to /Applications/, then open sandic the way you can open any OSX application.
