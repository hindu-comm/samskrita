Download the OSX executable from:<https://github.com/raindoctor/sandic/raw/master/sandic.app/Contents/MacOS/sandic>

Download the zipped db:<https://github.com/raindoctor/sandic/blob/master/db/sandic.db.zip>

  

unzip sandic.db.zip

  

then open sandic:

  

Keep sandic and sandic.db in the same directory:

  

chmod +x sandic

./sandic &

  

If you wanna keep in different directories, this can work as well. You can move sandic exec to /usr/local/bin, then alias it to pick up the db file.

  

/path/to/sandic db /path/to/sandic.db &
