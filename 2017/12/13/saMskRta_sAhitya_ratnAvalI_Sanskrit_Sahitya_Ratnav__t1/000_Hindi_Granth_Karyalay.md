Sanskrit Sahitya Ratnavali

Sanskrit literature is one of the richest in the world. From the Vedas to the Epics, from the Brahmanas to the Upanishads, from the Panchatantra to the Hitopadesha, from the classical works of Bhasa and Bhavabhuti to the magnificence of Bhartrihari, from the glorious writings of Jinasena and Hemacandra to the splendour of Kalidasa, Sanskrit literature is a magnificent treasure trove studded with unmatched gems. It is a vast array of glittering jewels, each of them unsurpassed in their lustre and craftsmanship.

  

There is no facet of life that Sanskrit literature has not touched upon. Sanskrit literature reflects the best that India has to offer. It expresses not only the writer’s thoughts but also the spirit of the age and its weltanschauung. Both secular and religious writings in Sanskrit literature abound in human values and virtues.   
  

The Government of India has now decided to take the initiative in familiarising the majority of people with the wonders of Sanskrit literature. With this purpose, they have begun a brand new series known as Sanskrit Sahitya Ratnavali. In this series, each volume will focus on one great Sanskrit writer, and his representative works shall be abridged and translated into Hindi by expert writers.

  

All the books in this series have been elegantly printed on high quality paper and display excellent art work on their covers.   
  
Here are the first four works of this ongoing series:
