In response to the post by Sri Aravind-ji' Prof. Vinod Vidwans writes:

  

I am aware about the previous studies and various proposals about 22 shrutis. There are more than 200 such proposals. All these proposals do not satisfy the criteria of \`Shruti-Nidarshanam' experiment mentioned in the Natyashastra. Dr. Vidyadhar Oak's proposal is not based on Bharata's Natyashastra.His proposal is based on Pythagorean concepts.I have discussed all these issues in my monograph \`The Doctrine of Shruti in Indian Music' which is available onthe website.

  

With Warm Regards
