Most of us recite prayers by rote. We would like to know the meaning and significance of what we are chanting. But since not many among us know Sanskrit, we end up not knowing the exact meaning of what we are reciting with such faith.   
  
Thanks to this work, even readers who do not know Sanskrit will be able to understand and recite with great feeling and emotion the stotras of their choice.   
  
The stotras covered in this book are as under:  
  

-   गणेशपञ्चरत्नम् Ganesha Pancaratna

-   भजगोविन्दम् Bhaja Govindam

-   विष्णुषट्पदीस्तोत्रम् Vishnu-Shatpadi Stotra

-   श्रीहर्यष्टकम् Shri-Hari-Ashtaka

-   श्रीहरिस्तोत्रम् Shri-Hari Stotra

-   श्रीकृष्णाष्टकम् Shri-Krishna-Ashtaka

-   शिवमानसपूजा Shiva-Manasa-Puja

-   रुद्राष्टकम् Rudra-Ashtaka

-   लिङ्गाष्टकम् Linga-Ashtaka

-   वैद्यनाथाष्टकम् Vaidyanatha-Ashtaka

-   आदित्यहृदयम् Aditya-Hridaya Stotra

  
All these stotras are explained beautifully. The format used in this book is intuitive and merits universal usage.   
1. First, the Stotra is introduced to the reader. An explanation of its title; the deity it addresses; when it should be recited and when it shouldn’t; the author; what the stotra is especially efficacious for; what rites should be observed before reciting it; what the worshipper gains after reciting the stotra; and the metre in which the stotra has been composed are given in the introduction.

2. Using a double page spread, the Sanskrit verse is given in Devanagari script on the left hand page and in the Roman script on the right hand page.

3. This is followed by a padaccheda {splitting of words} also given in Devanagari (on the LHP) and in Roman script (on the RHP).

4. This is followed by a pada paricaya, where each word of the verse is grammatically and lexically explained. This too is given in both Devanagari and Roman on the left hand and right hand pages respectively.
  
5. This is followed by an accurate and nicely worded English translation (on the RHP). And an anvayartha in Devanagari on the LHP.   
6. This is how each verse of each stotra has been explained.

7. It is a solid, painstaking effort and deserves great appreciation.   
  

This is a tremendous work and I sincerely hope that it will give rise to many more such books. As a lover of dharma, bhasha and sanskriti, I am proud to make this book available at my bookstore and through mail order.   
  

We ship within India as well as internationally.
