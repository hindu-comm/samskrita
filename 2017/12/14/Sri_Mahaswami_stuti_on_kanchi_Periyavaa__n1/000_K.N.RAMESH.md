Dear all,

  

Namaskaram

  

December 14, 2017 is Sri Mahaswami Aradhana day. With His Grace , I have composed a hymn on Him called Sri Mahaswami Shatkam, (first five stanzas in Indravajra metre or chandas and the last one on Upajathi metre). Vrutta Ratnakara identifies these two metres under the category of trishtup, consisting of leven letters or aksharas. Upajathi is combination of indravajra and upendra vajra metres. The four pathas of a stanza will be in permutation and combination of both these metres. Mahakavi Kalidasa had extensively used this metre in his works. There are a number of devotional hymns set in these metres.

  

Let us all pray to Him for the happiness and well being of everyone around 

  

  

thanks

  

Ravi

  

PS: Metre or chandas is prescribed no of syllables per line in a poem.
