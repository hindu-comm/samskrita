Pt. Ramavatara Sharma in hisIntroduction to Kalpadru Kosha of Keshava edited by him in 1928 (Baroda Oriental Inst. publn.) provides a list of known Koshas. It appears there are literally hundreds! I am attaching an extract that may be of interest to some members here. I wonder how many have seen the light of the day. I am personally interested in the Vastu (vaastu?)kosha, but so far no success.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
