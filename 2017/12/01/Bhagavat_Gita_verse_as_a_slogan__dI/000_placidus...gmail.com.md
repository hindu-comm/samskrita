Namaskar to all members,

  

Referring to the Bhagavadgita, Chapter 6 Verse 5:

  

**उद्धरॆत् आत्मना आत्मानं न आत्मानम् अवसादयॆत् ।  
आत्म एव हि आत्मनः बंधुः आत्म एव रिपुः आत्मनः ॥ ६.५ ॥**  

  

*uddharEt AtmanA AtmAnaM na AtmAnam avasAdayEt \|  
Atma eva hi AtmanaH baMdhuH Atma eva ripuH AtmanaH \|\| 6.5 \|\|  
*

  

Translated broadly as:***"Let a man raise himself by himself, let him not lower himself; for he alone is the friend of himself, he alone is the enemy of himself.**" (Swami Sivananda)*

  

How can this verse fragment, i.e.**उद्धरॆत् आत्मना आत्मानं**, which presumably refers to thetranslationfragment***Let a man raise himself by himself**,* be made into a ***grammaticallycorrect, standalone*** slogan?

  

**Please****advise on what grammar changes need to be made in****the verse fragment****उद्धरॆत् आत्मना आत्मानं to arrive at the following senses in Samskrita:**

**  
**

**1.Raise (your)/(one)/self by (your)/(one)/self**

**2.Uplift (your)/(one)/self by (your)/(one)/self**

  

  

**Your kind replies are requested.**

**  
**

**thanks**

**Harsha**
