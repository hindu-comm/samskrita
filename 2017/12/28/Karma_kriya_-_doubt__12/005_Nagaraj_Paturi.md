Karma - External action

Kriya - Internal action

              - Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha

  

--- I think Sri Jaggiji was only borrowing the most household pair of words from Sanskrit grammar to bring home what he wanted. The meanings are his own.

  

So no point in scanning the shastras for the source of the meanings.
