Karma - External action

Kriya - Internal action

              - Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha

  

1\) I am looking for etymology of both the words...

2\) karma - 3 types - sanchita,prarabdha & aagami... Similarly is there further divisions for kriya?

3\) Are these both words reflecting the same shade of meaning...?

  

thanks
