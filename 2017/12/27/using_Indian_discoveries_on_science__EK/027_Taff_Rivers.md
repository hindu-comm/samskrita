**Nagaraj Paturi,  
  
**So, all correspondents then, some more reluctantly than others, appear to agree that there is indeed, no substance to the notion that a citizen of India was the first to discover those laws.  
**  
**  
As to your particular assertion regarding *nonliving* bodies:

  
  
"The inability of bodies to change their state of rest or motion or direction of their motion mentioned in Newton's first law is the property of inanimate /nonliving bodies."  
  

I can assure you that  
 1. Newton was English.  
  2. Sir Isaac applied the vocabulary of his time.  
 3. The word ***body*** carries the self same associations then as now.  
  
Viz:  
** body**, n.  
 the physical structure and ***material substance of an animal or plant, living or dead***.  
  
Regardez s'il vous plait ...  
  
Also you assert:

  
  
 "The approach of books like Vis'eshika Sutras is to generalise for both living and nonliving together."  
  

Even though the very word Vaiśeṣika implies *particular* - confirmed by an analysis if the text itself - which, most unusual for a Sanskrit text is a transparent one (to this reader at least) requiring no external commentary to clarify obscurities!
