A theorem in Euclidean Geometry is proved through a certain Euclidean method of proof. To prove the same theorem through aliter is also well within the method of Euclidean geometry. Does any one know how, through which method , Euclid arrived at each of those theorems?

  

The same truth of geometry expressed through a certain Euclidean theorem is 'proved' using Cartesian algebraic method.

  

Did you ever think of how Dalton arrived at the postulates of his atomic theory?

  

Did you ever oppose books mentioning that Democritus (pupil of Leucippus) was the first one to propose atom and he and his teacher were the ones who coined the word 'atom'? Did you ever question how these ancient Greeks arrived at the idea of atom? Did you consider that Dalton's embracing of the same idea 'meant nothing'?

  

If, to arrive at the truths/laws /principles of nature through experimental method is the only method that means something /everything, how about the laws /principles arrived at through Mathematical Physics? Isn't mathematics a kind of reasoning?

  

Is every piece of knowledge in disciplines like Botany and Zoology arrived at through experimental method?

  

Are the methods of all modern sciences the same?

  

If method of one of the modern sciences is correct , is the other science wrong because it did not follow the method?

  

If being logical and being based on factual observations of nature is the common thread among the methods of all modern sciences, isn't it a fact that books like Vais'eshika Dars'ana are the outcomes of a highly rigorous logic and were always based on /discussed in terms of factual obserations of nature?
