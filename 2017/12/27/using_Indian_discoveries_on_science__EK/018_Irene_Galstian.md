You are right, Dr. Paturi. We do need to know of such discoveries and not just in school textbooks, but read the works in which the discoverer makes his findings known, if these works are available. Not being similar to Descartes or Galileo isn't in itself proof of inferiority. What we regard as science and what we reject as non-science is often a matter of habit.

We'd benefit from being more inclusive.
