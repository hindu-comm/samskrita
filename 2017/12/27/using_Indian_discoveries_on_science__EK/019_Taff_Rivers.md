Which Kaṇāda sutras?  
  
Such assertions should be properly investigated to determine their veridicality.  
  
Putting aside these wars of words, that have the emotional character, and do no more than reveal the character of their owner.  
Surely, it is not more enlightening to view matters from a more objective perspective to reveal the character of Kaṇāda's statements.  
  
To start with, I find no such quotations as those provided in the anonymous .jpg:  
  
 वेगः निमित्तविशेषात कर्मणो जायते  
 वेग निमित्तापेक्षात कर्मणो जायते नियतदिक क्रियाप्रबन्धहेतु  
 वेगः संयोगविशेषविरोधी  
  
I understand that:  
*  
Till the 1950s, only one manuscript of Vaiseshika sutra was known and this manuscript was part of a bhasya by the 15th century Sankaramisra.\[21\]  
Scholars had doubted its authenticity, given the inconsistencies in this manuscript and the quotes in other Hindu, Jaina and Buddhist literature claiming to be from the Vaisheshika Sutra.  
  
In the 1950s and early 1960s, new manuscripts of Vaiśeṣika Sūtra were discovered in distant parts of India, which were later identified as this Sutra.  
  
These newer manuscripts are quite different, more consistent with the historical literature, and suggests that, like other major texts and scriptures of Hinduism,  
  
Vaiśeṣika Sūtra too suffered interpolations, errors in transmission and distortion over time.  
  
*  
I have searched through both the 'early' and 'newer' manuscripts, in their Devanagari and Latin incarnations  
(all of which are of recent vintage, none being of a 2,500 year vintage!).  
  
Let us first agree on ***which*** Kaṇāda's sutras refer to these 'laws of motion'.  
  
***Then*** to interpret them in a sensible (objective) manner, giving justifications (reasons!) for the interpretation.
