Mr Shankara_2000,  
  
So we (all two of us!) have established that those sensational quotations have been erroneously attributed to our friend Kaṇāda.  
And thus can affirm that what is now referred to as the 'the three laws of motion' were indeed not discovered in ancient India, at least not 2,500 odd years ago.  
  
But that we have to jump forward more than a millennium to a work of a certain Praśastapāda, for even a hint of such.  
  
Which is of course another issue entirely:  
  
 Did this Praśastapāda discover 'the three laws of motion' and in what actual quotations for which interpretations along with ***justifications*** for those interpretations.***  
***  
Some assumptions have to be made, not so much as the *ancientry* or otherwise of these texts - we have to rely on the words of those that know these things - but who was the first in temporal terms.  
  
What Kaṇāda **did** say, which is quite remarkable given the cultural background of ritual observations of his time, is that realisation of the 'Universal One' is *not* achieved by rituals but through deliberate conscious effort of will. Nodana (impulse) is the word he uses, in its sense of *impulsive force.  
  
*Wilfulness of the mind that is. By way of clarification in a climate of unquestioning obedience to authority, his advocations that individuals could, and indeed should, undertake action of their own violation amount to revolution against authority!  
  
He has to make it quite clear that the authority in question is that of the supervision of one's own behaviour.  
  
Such possibility is hinted at the chanting of the Lord's Prayer of the Christian faith; *  
Thy Kingdom come.  
Thy will be done **in earth**,  
As it is in heaven.  
  
*To be understood as in *this* life as opp. to the one that is said to come *after* death.*  
  
*Kaṇāda however, goes further in that he elaborates on *the manner* in which this desirable state is accomplished.  
using the bodily Nodana whereby a clay pot is first raised and then by the hand through the physical effort of raising that hand.  
  
  
Kaṇāda's statements on that matter, are transparent to the reader, there is nothing for the reader to infer.  
  
As to Praśastapāda, first comes the need to catergorise the work, the to interpret accordingly...  
  
**This** calls for hard effort! In the meantime I am checking out this 2010 offering to do the work for me, but...
