Why should there be any doubt regarding inertia being the feature of the nonliving?

  

What is so offending in the assertion that Newton's laws are the laws about nonliving bodies?

  

To take the discussion a little further, living creatures have bodies which are in themselves 'non-living'. When 'life' leaves these bodies, the remaining 'dead' bodies follow Newton's laws. It is life in the living bodies that makes them not to follow Newton's laws, i.e., which makes them change from rest to motion and vice versa and the change the direction of motion without the role of any 'external' force.

  

If the process of 'intending' to change from rest to motion and vice versa and the change the direction of motion and sending moto-neuron messages to change from rest to motion and vice versa and the change the direction of motion and to actually change from rest to motion and vice versa and the change the direction of motion is considered to be the function of 'life' and not the body in which the life dwells, and this 'life' is considered to be 'external' to the 'body', then Newton's laws can be argued to be applying to the living entities too.

  

But to understand to which portion of the living entity the laws apply , to which portion they do not , helps in understanding 'life' and its functions better.

  

Inertia is not only the property of the non-living , it is the measure of non-life too.

  

---------------------------------------

  

Vais'eshika is certainly focused on vis'esha, the specific. That does not mean it generalises. Its sutras are generalisations only.

  

Vais'eshika is understood as paired up with Nyaya.

  

The word vis'esha in Vais'eshika is understood in two ways:

  

1\. Nyaya is general/pure logic. Vais'eshika is the logic applied to *specific* real life cases. Nyaya is general logic. Vais'eshika is *applied* logic. Nyaya applied to Vis'esha.

  

2\. More traditional explanation in vogue is that Vis'eshikas are called so because they added one more category Vis'esha to the categories established by Nyaya.

  

-----------------------------------------

  

"no substance to the notion that a citizen of India was the first to discover those laws."

  

seems to satisfy you. So be it.

  

But the other point under question was

  

whether notions discovered by modern science can be identified to have been discovered during earlier times by people in different parts of the world

  

whether the identifications of such discoveries found in ancient Sanskrit texts 'mean nothing', 'not to be gloated over' etc.
