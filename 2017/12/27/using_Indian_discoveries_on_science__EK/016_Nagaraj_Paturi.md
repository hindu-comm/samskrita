\>If my memory serves me right- to be honest, it doesn't these days-my school text books of early fifties-last century-mentioned of Kanada's contribution to Atomic Theory. Whatever discoveries/inventions Indians have been known to have made have been acknowledged and recognized in histories of Science.

  

-- Was there a statement anywhere in the thread , to the effect that histories of science did not acknowledgediscoveries/inventions Indians have been known to have made?

  

Your "means nothing" comment was in response to a discussion on the same Kanada whose achievement, at least in terms of Atomic Theory was taught to you when you were young. The thread was discussing his other achievements. What made you respond negatively to that discussion? You want people not to discuss any other achievement of Kanada than the one(s) not acknowledged by the 'histories of science'?
