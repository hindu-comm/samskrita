I am just back in front of my system.

  

Which view of Taff_ji do you endorse Sri G S S Murthy_ji?

  

His views of textual criticism of the text of Vaiseshika Sutras?

  

Mr Taff says he has hands on studies of manuscripts.

  

Do you?

  

Is your endorsement based on that hands on knowledge of you of the textual critical studies of the book?

  

Or,

  

You endorse any view that raises a finger of suspicion on the achievements in the ancient Sanskrit texts?

  

Do you stick to your Science and Scientifoc Method argument or would
you like to shift to the textual criticism argument or a combination of the two?

  

-------------------

  

Now to Mr Taff:

  

Taff-ji,

  

You should have noted that Mr Ken's initiating post was responded to through a suspicion about Newton's laws claim in the jpg.

  

This continued into negation of the Newton's laws claim by both myself and Sri Shankara-ji.

  

When no one in the thread claimed Newton's laws in the book, whom are you asking to prove from whichever version of the text?

  

I appreciate your interest in and your claim of your previous work in the textual criticism of the text.

  

Unless the version of the text having the discussion of gravitation is proved to be later to Newton , claim of the idea of gravity in the book independent of or prior to Newton can not be disproved.

  

Is that proved?
