I am really sorry that my posting has provoked Dr Nagaraj Paturiji to make a long rebuttal.

If my memory serves me right- to be honest, it doesn't these days-my school text books of early fifties-last century-mentioned of Kanada's contribution to Atomic Theory. Whatever discoveries/inventions Indians have been known to have made have been acknowledged and recognized in histories of Science.

In my view Modern Science started from the days of Galileo, Descartes and others.

If somewhere in Sanskrit texts velocity of light is given as a statement or the age of universe is given which matches with the present day estimates, it is not something to be gloated over. Science is not built on such ant-hills of knowledge.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
