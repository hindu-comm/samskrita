The inability of bodies to change their state of rest or motion or direction of their motion mentioned in Newton's first law is the property of inanimate /nonliving bodies.

  

The approach of books like Vis'eshika Sutras is to generalise for both living and nonliving together.

  

That is the reason, I have been opposing the possibility of laws limited to the nonliving being found in the sutras. If the sutras intend to cover laws limited to the nonliving, they do so by mentioning that specificity in the sutra.

  

Sri Shankara-ji was only providing reference to the quote He is always amazing at such source digging. He did not make any claim that it is Newton's law.

  

The article mentioned in the thread initiating post does mention that the mathematics , specifically calculus is older than Newton and Leibnitz in India. It attempts to guess a process of travel of these ideas to Europe from India.

  

Similarity in ideas of two different places and times need not always be through diffusion.

  

That is what those who object to the possibility of ideas of a place and time occuring in an older time and a different place miss to acknowledge.
