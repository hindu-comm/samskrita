Namaskarams! . There is one interesting story/episode about how
sound is interpreted by different people:

<http://nrsrini.blogspot.in/2012/09/da-da-dadama-daya-and-daana.html>

DA, DA, DA--DAMA, DAYA AND DAANA (BRIHADAARANYAKA UPANISHAD)

the syllable 'da' is interpreted by Gods, Humans and Demons as 'daman(control)', 'daana(charity)' and 'daya(compassion)' respectively, all being judged correct.

-regards.
