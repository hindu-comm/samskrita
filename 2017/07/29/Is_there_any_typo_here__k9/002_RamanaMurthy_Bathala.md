Thank you sir.

  

Yes there is a faint line crossing. It is too faint to recognize.

  

I found one more conjunct letter ण्ण in the same book. Exactly the same faint line crossing is observed. So it is confirmed there is no typo. Please find below.

Actually I thought that the faint line may be the mark generated during the scanning of the book.
