“boy”.So I decided  

that both विद्य and विद्यक  
mean the same thing i.e. “knowledge”. Since विद्य is  
neuter gender, विद्यक  
should also be neuter gender. So its  
nominative form is विद्यकम् ( like फल ->  

फलम्).As if my  

miseries are not  
enough, prefix “आ” is added,  
making it difficult to  
understand its meaning. The word used is आविद्यकं  
āvidyakaṃ. Here is a  

caveat.As per my  

little grammar  
knowledge:आ +  
विद्यकं  
= आविद्यकं ( No  

Sandhi, just two words)आ +  



Sanskrit-English Dictionaryआ =  

In  
composition with nouns it forms indeclinables, either crude,  
as आजानु  
to the knee, or with the terminations of the  
objective or ablative case,  
as आसमुद्रं or आसमुद्रात् as far as  
to the ocean.To  
understand single word “आविद्यकं“, I have to  
struggle hard hours together. Had it been  
an English word, I would have got the meaning with in a  
minute online with  
examples using Google.I request  
someone help me  

with the following details.1. What is  

the meaning of the word “आविद्यकं” 2. Is this  
declinable or  
indeclinable. In case declinable, please provide its case  
and number.Metaphysics  
(Philosophy) itself  
is difficult to understand. Added to that the difficulty of  
grammar of Sanskrit.Regards
