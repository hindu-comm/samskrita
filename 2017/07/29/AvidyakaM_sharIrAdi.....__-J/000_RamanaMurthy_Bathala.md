Dear sir,

  The following is from Atma Bodha

 आविद्यकं शरीरादिदृश्यं बुद्बुदवत्क्षरम् ।

 एतद्विलक्षणं विद्यादहं ब्रह्मेति निर्मलम् ॥३१॥



The following is from AtmaBodha by Swamy Chnmayananda:

I was trying to find out the word for word meaning. I am able to find meanings of all the words except “आविद्यकं”. With little grammar knowledge I have, I am finding a lot of trouble to understand its literal / grammatical meaning. I spent many hours searching online, burning mid-night oil. Referred many dictionaries. In “आविद्यकं” , the only thing I know is विद्य (knowledge). It seems suffix क is added to make it विद्यकं. So I tried to find the meaning given by suffix ’क’ in the dictionary. I have to narrow down which is relevant in the given context. Finally, I selected the following:

Apte Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 1890

क =A Taddhita affix added to nouns and adjectives, mostly to the former, in the sense of diminution, deterioration, similarity, endearment, or sometimes to express the original meaning of the word itself; e. g. वृक्षकः a small tree; बालकः a chap; पुत्रकः dear boy; अश्वकः a bad horse, or like a horse, or a horse itself (स्वार्थे कन्).



Now I have to guess the meaning of विद्यक.



“क” is used to express the original meaning of the word itself. Ex. बाल and बालक both mean “boy”.

So I decided that both विद्य and विद्यक mean the same thing i.e. “knowledge”. Since विद्य is neuter gender, विद्यक should also be neuter gender. So its nominative form is विद्यकम् ( like फल -> फलम्).

As if my miseries are not enough, prefix “आ” is added, making it difficult to understand its meaning. The word used is आविद्यकं *āvidyakaṃ*.



Here is a caveat.

As per my little grammar knowledge:

आ + विद्यकं = आविद्यकं ( No Sandhi, just two words)

आ + अविद्यकं = आविद्यकं (Sandhi happened here. आ + अ = आ)

  

Now confusion is : is आ added to विद्यकं or अविद्यकं? They give exactly opposite meanings.

  

I am following Swamy Chinmayanada’s Atma Bodha book. Obeisance to Swamy Chinmayanada.

  

In the book it is given:

आ + आविद्यकं = up to the causal body

  

There are two long vowels (आ) here. From where did these two आs come? More over, Swamiji used the word “causal body”. There is no word referring to causal body. विद्य means knowledge and अविद्य means ignorance. But how come “causal body” meaning is taken?



But let me see what the meaning of prefix आ. There are so many meanings to this prefix and it is difficult to apply the correct meaning in the context. But I have to understand somehow, so I choose the following meaning.

  

Shabda-Sagara Sanskrit-English Dictionary

आ = In composition with nouns it forms indeclinables, either crude, as आजानु to the knee, or with the terminations of the objective or ablative case, as आसमुद्रं or आसमुद्रात् as far as to the ocean.



To understand single word “आविद्यकं“, I have to struggle hard hours together. Had it been an English word, I would have got the meaning with in a minute online with examples using Google.



I request someone help me with the following details.

1. What is the meaning of the word “आविद्यकं”

2. Is this declinable or indeclinable. In case declinable, please provide its case and number.



*Metaphysics (Philosophy) itself is difficult to understand. Added to that the difficulty of grammar of Sanskrit.*
