I sympathise with your description 100%. Please take the following in that vein.  
  

1\. Before one reads philosophy is Sanskrit, it's better for one's sanity to comfortably read ordinary Sanskrit. An easy self-test is Hitopadesa. Can you read and understand it comfortably? Can you retell these stories in your own words? If yes, move on. If not, don't bother with sublime texts just yet, as there is other work to be done first.  

2\. When you do move on to philosophical texts, it's more efficient to start with a text that has a translation intended to help with the language, not just any translation available.  
  

It's better to recognise these and to optimise one's work than to get exhausted from spending an hour on one word and giving up on Sanskrit as 'too difficult' after a while.
