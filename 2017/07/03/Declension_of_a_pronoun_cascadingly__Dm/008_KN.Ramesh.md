Respected Prof.Dr.Bhat ji,

  

Then the vibhakti prayoga android app needs to be informed about this, because it is giving the declension forईकारान्त: स्त्रीलिÑग:, त्वत् शब्द: .

  

BTW,उभ - ekavacanam & bahuvacanam are not coming in vibhakti prayoga; app and it gives only dvivacana roopams in masculine,feminine & neuter genders.

Is it because the word always denotes two and hence singular & plural forms it cannot take?

  

उभय - Here dvivacana roopams are not coming when it is reckoned as neuter gender. Is it missed intentionally? If dvivacana roopam is there, kindly provide.

  

Please help.

  

Namaskarams
