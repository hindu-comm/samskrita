Ramana,  
  
 The base is tva (tvam).  
  
Tvat is the internal sandhied form it takes in compounds.  
  
Tvam being the base of the second person 'you'.  
  
As such, neither the first person, aham nor the second have gender.  
Only the third person saḥ takes the three genders.  
  
May I refer you to Coulson's Teach Yourself Sanskrit, 2nd edition, Appendix 2, page 285 for the complete declensions, which makes this clear.  
Appliable to Classic and Vedic texts.  
  
Hope this clarifies things.
