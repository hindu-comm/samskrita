The Panchami Ekavachan ("Ablative case") of युष्मद् is त्वत्, which is not the "same"त्वत् that is in the list ofसर्वनाम words. The two words are similar looking, but they are completely different from each other.There is no relation between त्वत् as the पञ्चम्येकवचन of युष्मद्, and त्वत् as a प्रातिपदिक representing a सर्वनाम word. Their meaning is different and their derivation is different.

As explained above.
