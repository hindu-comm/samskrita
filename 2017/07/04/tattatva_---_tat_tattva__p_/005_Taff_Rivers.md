Valerio,  
  
 The tad in question is stands for 'that', but indicating neither this nor that, having no definite location, and as such, something that cannot be pinpointed.  
often used to mean Brahma.  
  
Literally, it is 'that-ness'. Made up of 'tad', plus the suffix -tva, where -tva is used to indicate the abstract 'state or condition', corresponding to the English -ness as in happiness.etc.  
  
I am not able explain in the Devanagari script, hence the English.  
.  
Taff,
