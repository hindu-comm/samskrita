There are two 'tat' s here.

  

One is part of tattvam.

  

The other is the isolated 'tat', the pronoun.

  

The pronoun tat refers to kim = what , the interrogative pronoun.

  

A relative clause based complex sentence is formed in an indirect way.

  

What is there in Gayatree, Aaditya and Agni ? That is tattvam =brahman.
