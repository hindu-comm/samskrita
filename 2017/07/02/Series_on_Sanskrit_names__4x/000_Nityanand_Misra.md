Dear list

  

I have started a new short video series on Sanskrit names. In each video, I will pick up a Sanskrit name, give its root(s), and explain it in English.

  

The first video of the series is here. Please share with those who may be interested.

Would like to hear your feedback and suggestions.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
