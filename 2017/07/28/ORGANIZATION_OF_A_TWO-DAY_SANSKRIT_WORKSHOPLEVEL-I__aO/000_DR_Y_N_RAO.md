**Dear All,**

****

**I am a 79-year old Telugu-speaking Linguist from Hyderabad (Telangana), India. **

****

**You might be aware that I have been teaching the Divine Language – SANSKRIT free of cost since five years by running an e-mail - based Free Sanskrit Basics’ Course titled ‘LEARN SANSKRIT MODULES’ through the Internet.**

****

**It may be observed that the Sanskrit Language –is written in the Script called the ‘DEVANAAGARII’ and that there are several people who are not familiar with this script but are seen learning the Sanskrit language, chanting Mantraas, Shlokaas, Devotional Verses, etc. of Sanskrit either through the medium of the script of their mother-tongue or English. Obviously, one can not feel the real pulse of this language unless he/she is comfortable with the Devanaagarii Script.**

****

**With a view to make the aspirants of learning the Sanskrit language familiar with the Devanaagarii Script, it is proposed to organize a ‘Two-Day Sanskrit Workshop – Level-I’ on 9^(th) (Saturday) and 10^(th)
(Sunday) September, 2017 from 10 AM to 5 PM at Bengaluru. Equal importance would be given to both theory and practice of various Scientific aspects including Pronunciation related to the Devanaagarii Script during this Workshop, so as to make the participants feel that they could gain adequate familiarity with it within these two days.**

****

**I am very happy to state that Mr. P.R. Selvaganesh, a Philanthropic-minded Student of the on-going Round-5 of my ‘LEARN SANSKRIT MODULES’ Course hailing from Bangalore is hosting this Two-Day Event! **

****

**This Workshop is organized under the banner of ‘Shri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC)’, Shri Aurobindo Aashram, Puducherry(Pondicherry).**
