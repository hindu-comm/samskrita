पञ्चम्यास्तसिल् (4-3-7)

The affix tasil is used in the sense of panchamI (which is called ablative in Sanskrit grammars in English).

  

avaghAta + tasil = avaghAtataH

  

अवघात + तसिल् =अवघाततः (after इत् deletion)  

  

It might be easier for you if you switch sooner rather than later to Paninian terminology. :-) My experience is that English terminology gets you off the ground fast, but then limits you rather quickly.
