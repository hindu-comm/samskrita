Ramana,  
  
 Now that we have a context, this someone (Taff) offers the following resolution:  
  
The तः at the end, is one of those suffixes namely त, used to indicate the abstract 'state or condition of'.  
The त gets changed to तः when it comes at the end of a line, but as to exactly why that happens is a bit of a mystery, to me at least.  
  
The state in question being that of the aforementioned yogic practice that is likened to the metaphoric threshing of the corn.  
The work being poetic in nature, not literal text:

Anyway, I don''t see where you get your 'instrumental case' from.  
 Regards,  
Taff
