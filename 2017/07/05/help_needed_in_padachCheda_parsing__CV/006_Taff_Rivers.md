Ramana,  
  
 This rendering of the Atma Bhoda\* has the aim of explaining the meaning of the work in English.  
  
While the Roman transliteration is inaccurate, in terms of its long/short vowels etc.  
and the English meaning adds many extra words by way of clarification,  
it does help in *understanding* of the work.  
  
While Paninian rules are largely unambiguous for writing Devanagari, the reading of such writings is another matter altogether as there are so many different uses for each of those words.  
And while the authors would have a particular meaning in mind, that information is not available to the reader.  
  
Endless are the commentaries that claim to have read the authors mind.  
The only valid useful ones would be those by the original authors themselves, but...  
  
Guru Taff, he say 'Grammarians can but be instrumental in providing means to an end. Following the means, is is up to individual readers of all these words.'  
  
 Regards,  
  
Taff

Atma Bhoda 16  
  
Vapus Tushadibhih Kosaih  
Yuktam Yuktya Avaghaatatah  
Atmanam Antaram Suddham  
Vivichyaat Tandulam Yatha.  
  
  
Just as rice is obtained by pounding  
paddy and separating the husk, bran etc., we  
can separate Pure Atma within from the  
encircling of Five Kosas through careful  
discrimination. When one clearly realises the  
soul to be distinct from the Kosas, he becomes  
detached from them. This detachment is  
followed by knowledge of the  
self.
