युक्ति + अवघाततः = युक्त्यवघाततः= by the process of shelling of reason;

अवघात(m)=Threshing corn, by bruising it with a wooden pestle in a mortar of the same material.

The word used is अवघाततः and is carrying the instrumentalcase meaning. I am unable to understand how the word अवघाततः is derived from अवघात.



Could someone shed some light on this problem?
