I feel that the pedagogic value of the story series would be optimised if, once the list members discuss possible grammatical/typo corrections, one of the experts kindly reviews them and pronounces the story error free. After that, a post with the fully corrected final version would be beneficial before we move on to the next story.

This is less relevant for very simple stories like the present one and more relevant for texts with more or less nontrivial language.
