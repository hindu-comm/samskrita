Panchaadi is the short form of pancashat in sanskrit. Pncaashat means 50.

  

It is defined as , "That portion of veda in pada paata form which has 50 padaas in it "

  

So each panchaadi has 50 padams in it.

This rule is not applicable for the portion appearing at the end of an anuvaka. The ending portion after a panchaadi can have any no. of padams.

  

This can be well understood only when you chant the veda portion along with chittaa vaakyams that is recited at the end of an anuvaka and at the end of the chapter.
