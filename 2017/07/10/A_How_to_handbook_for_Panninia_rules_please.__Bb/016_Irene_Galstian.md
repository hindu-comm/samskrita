Taff,  
  
True. Let's speak closer to October and reassess.  

  

What do you mean by 'informed process to be followed to arrive at those particular sūtras'?  

Let's take another system, say Hilbert's foundations of geometry. You want to know how theorems in geometry are traced back to the foundations, or you want to know how Hilbert himself decided that these were the foundations on which to base geometry?  

  

Cheers,  

Irene
