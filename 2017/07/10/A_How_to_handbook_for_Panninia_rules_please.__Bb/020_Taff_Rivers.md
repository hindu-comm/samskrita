The emphasis is the decoding of Sanskrit text that has already been encoded.  
  
There are precise rules for composing text in that language, and there are volumes of such material available in bi-lingual and tri-lingual editions.  
  
Decomposing such texts is an entirely different prakriyā.  
  
How does a professionally trained Sanskrit commentator, replete with 8,000 sutras in his mind (or before his eyes on a computer screen), set about developing his commentary?  
  
It is matter of him describing, verbally, his thought prakriyā's.  
In the same way that a radio commentator gives a running commentary that is taking place on a remote cricket field.  
  
And most importantly, by a completely impartial non guru type commentator.  
Reciting rules as a batsman might, is one thing, *describing* to youngsters, how to actually hit the ball so that it goes exactly where you want it to go is an entirely different ball game.  
  
One of those two process is rare and priceless, the other commonplace.  
  
So, you priceless ones, you are needed.
