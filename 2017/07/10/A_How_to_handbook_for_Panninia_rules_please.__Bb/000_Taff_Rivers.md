All,  
  
 A **How to handbook**, for English speakers if at all possible, please.  
  
How to make those densely packed rules, accessible to all?  
  
They were so packed in those ancient times, solely out of necessity.  
There being the almost complete absence of durable recording media, stone carving excepted.  
  
Now, since the last century, we have digital media with its easy accessibility by everyone, not only to the highly literate few.  
  
The very young, with their high capabilities of memorisation and long term retention were employed for the task, which took quite a few years of rote learning.  
Thus that ancient work brought all the way down to us in this 21st century.  
  
So, to my quest as a not so young a person; Are there any contemporary companion works explaining how to put them rules to good use?  
In other words *how to use that raw data*?  
  
There are a few works that purport to do so, but which, in practice, turn out to do no such thing.  
  
The rules have been digitally available for some years now, vis. the Ganakastadhyayi. see attached screen shot.  
  
But then there is the process of tracking the rules, sub rules, exceptions, exception to exceptions etc. applicable to a writer's particular need.  
  
 Regards,
