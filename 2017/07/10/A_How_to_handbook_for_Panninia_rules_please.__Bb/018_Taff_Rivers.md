Any offers please.  
  
If there is one such knowledgeable person able to advise on the use of the most eminent of all Sanskṛt grammars - the aṣtādhyāyī of Pāṇini - it must be someone like our own professor HH Bhat.  
  
In this digital age it is surely not necessary to have to spend years at a very young age, to memorise that work, as a prerequisite to learning *how to employ* that knowledge.  
That is, how to use that rule book, in order to write correct Devanagari.  
  
Such a handbook is easily transliterated, being a one letter, one sound language.  
  
It would surely be stocked by all academic institutions on the planet, if not every bookshop.  
  
The Sanskṛt being but a means to end - access to the ancient wisdom contained therein.  
Commentaries of old rely heavily on the culture and lexicon available then. A *Then*, spanning undated centuries with attendant difficulties of interpretation.  
  
The framework - the aṣtādhyāyīitself - is already in available as a base, for modifying as required.  
  
Perhaps, completely digital (but printable) handbook like one of them multi-editor wikipedia projects?
