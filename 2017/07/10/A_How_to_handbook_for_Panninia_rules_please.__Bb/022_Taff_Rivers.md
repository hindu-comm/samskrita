S. L. Abhyankar,  
  
 Explanations, including yours, are not necessary if the original utterances/texts are self explanatory,  
The fact that such explanations exist, is an indication that the original is unclear.  
  
And when we have explanations of those explanations - because the proceeding one(s) are unsatisfactory...  
  
That has been pointed out to you previously, 2 years back, in this forum, along with an explanation why that is so.  
  
Explaining, that is teaching, is a skill. Where I come from teachers, must complete a three year course at an authorised teaching college, learning how to teach.  
Admission to such, requiring 18 years of prior education in the subject itself - to necessary standards.  
  
There are very good reasons why this is so!  
Ask the pupils, their parents, those that employ those so taught.  
  
Again, the unsatisfactoriness of the Siddhānta-kaumudī to English speakers, along with the explanation as to why that is so, has already been provided as feedback.  
  
That there remains a requirement for a satisfactory explanation is clear, it is the development of such an explanation that remains to be formulated and implemented - by those that are not only masters of their subject by also those that are well experienced in teaching the subject in those unruly real world classrooms.  
  
Let such give a classroom lecture to those such as myself, of how he goes about doing his task of grammatical analysis of a given text.  
That us pupils may satisfactory understand that process.  
  
Someone who does not have a personal interest in the matter or who otherwise publicly declares so.
