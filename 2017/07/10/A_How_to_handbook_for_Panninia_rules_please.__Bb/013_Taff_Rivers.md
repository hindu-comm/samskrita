All,  
  
Re A **How to handbook.**  
  
I have come upon *The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini with Translation and Explanatory Notes - Pāṇini, Shivram Dattatray Joshi, J. A. F. Roodbergen  
  
*A free download (.html) of the first volume covering 1.1.1- 1.1.75 is available from:  
  
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-ORoMv4DtOQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=bibliogroup:%22The+A%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%AD%C4%81dhy%C4%81y%C4%AB+of+P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini+with+Translation+and+Explanatory+Notes%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL4PvB3IDVAhWDcRQKHa3RDEAQ6AEIWTAH  
](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-ORoMv4DtOQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=bibliogroup:%22The+A%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%AD%C4%81dhy%C4%81y%C4%AB+of+P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini+with+Translation+and+Explanatory+Notes%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL4PvB3IDVAhWDcRQKHa3RDEAQ6AEIWTAH)  
It is exactly what I have been looking for.  
  
I have inquired of of the publishers [sa...@sahitya-akademi.gov.in](), as to what Volumes are in print (there are many in the set).  
  
Their website is 'undergoing renovation' when I checked it...  
  
Equivalent Nagari originals are there too, but I don't know which of them have downloadables.  
  
I am also looking for a means to get the text, minus markup tags, from a .html as a simple way to post example content.
