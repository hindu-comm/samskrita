It comes to mind that "How to" is actually the "Prakriyaa".

I think one should look for English translation (with Roman transliteration of all Devanaagaree quotes) of some book such as prakriyaa-sarvasvam.

Internet search by typing in Devanaagareeas प्रक्रियासर्वस्वम् often lends interesting and useful results. When doing such search I came across mention of Mr. Gangadharan Nair.

Mr. Shankara has done great yeoman's work at Sanskrit e-books. I am marking Cc to him.

There was some interaction about प्रक्रियासर्वस्वम्at
