Irene,  
  
 Many thanks for the info.  
  
  
I have succeeded in obtaining a yellow with age ex library copy of Volume I.  
  
It does go *someway* towards the **How to.  
  
**Examples provided, list the (9) steps showing the derivation of bhavīta 'he will come' from the root bhū 'be, become', for instance.  
Each step referring the sequenced Pāṇinian sūtras that apply.  
but.. not the informed process to be followed to arrive at those particular sūtras in the first place.  
  
Digital is preferred, rather than hard copies or scans, as to allow for easy searching note taking for one finger typists, like myself.  
  
A lot of water can be passed between now an October, we'll have to see.  
  
Regards,  
  
 Taff
