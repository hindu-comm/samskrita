Solutions come after problems. Solutions can be reverse engineered, but when there is no *solution...  
*  
In mathematical or logical terms - the algorithm.  
  
To elaborate*:*  
  
I want to know to *use* the book.  
What *system* to follow, in order to come up with those sequences.  
Like *how* do our esteemed grammarians come up with their sequence of steps to arrive at the final form of a usable word.  
  
Listed sequences are solutions.  
Solutions to particular derivation problems.  
  
*Staring with the problem* is an entirely situation.  
  
How to approach to the problem...  
  
It's not necessarily easy, even when you know how (:-(  
  
Per ardua ad astra.
