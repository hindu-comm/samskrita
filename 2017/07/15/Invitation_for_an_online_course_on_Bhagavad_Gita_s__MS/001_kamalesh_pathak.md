Honestly I believe that if one like me is poor with Sanskrit, he should read authentic translation in own mother tongue of Gita, but teaching online is just like a dose given to you, that should be avoided, if you try to understand one by one shloka with multi dimension, you will enjoy the reading with developed thought process and more than your beliefs,

Long before I tried to read Gita, daily one shloka, thinking for hours and for most shloka I got social, personal, economical, scientific, psychological, philosophical meanings,

One can try as an experiment and post their experience to this forum.
