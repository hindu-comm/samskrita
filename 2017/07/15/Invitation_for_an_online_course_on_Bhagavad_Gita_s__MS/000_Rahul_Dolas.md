Namaste!

  

I came across an online course on Bhagavad Gita, which is a 10-hour online lecture series.

This course aims to give you an overview of Bhagavad Gita by going through each of its 18 chapters. You will learn important lessons and practical tips that you can use in your daily life to become a better version of yourself. This course will give you a whole new approach of Bhagavad Gita when you will read it on your own!

  

Interested people, please visit - <https://OpenPathshala.com/bhagavad-Gita> to join the course.

  

Dhanyavad!
