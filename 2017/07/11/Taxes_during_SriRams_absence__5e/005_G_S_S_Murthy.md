As per Valmiki, Bharata did not do a bad job at all during his 14-year rule. Bharata himself tells Rama,

"अवेक्षतां भवान् कोशं कोष्ठागारं गृहं बलम् ।  

भवतस्तेजसा सर्वं कृतं दशगुणं मया ॥६-१२७-५७ ॥

The treasury became 10 times bigger ! and that works out to CAGR of about 17.9%. No mean achievement that !

Regards,

Murthy
