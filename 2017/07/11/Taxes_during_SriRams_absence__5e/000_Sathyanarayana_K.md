There is a story about taxes in Ramayan: "During Bharata's 14 year rule, citizens paid no tax and hence treasury was empty when SriRam returned as King. So He asked people to donate gold weight of a pumpkin from each, withHanuman overseeing." Kindly let us know if
there any reference/truth in this story?
