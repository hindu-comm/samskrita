Respected Ramesh,

  

Sir, I have not understood some of the words and would seek your assistance:

I think it should have been शरच्छन्द्रिमायामिनी

What is मथुरहंसगामिनी ? Does it mean "Swan belonging to Mathura".

मयुरपक्षशिरवाहकः - I think it should be मयूरपक्ष . .

मुरुलीधरः - I think should have been मुरलीधर:
