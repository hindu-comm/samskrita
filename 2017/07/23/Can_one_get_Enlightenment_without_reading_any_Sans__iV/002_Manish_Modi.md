Any text is the crystallisation of the experience and insight of the ancient seers.

  

As you know, there are two entities. Sva-tattva {self} and para-tattva {external entities}. All others, even the Deva - Shastra - Guru, are para tattva from the perspective of the soul. One has to experience self-realisation on one's own.

  

Texts illumine the path. But one has to walk the path oneself. No one else can walk the path for you.

  

It helps the saadhaka to have read the ancient texts. But all knowledge is present within the soul. One has to unlock it through sadhana and dhyana and the internalisation of consciousness. Once attachment is uprooted, the innate omniscience of the soul manifests itself.

  

Ken, I hope I have answered your question.
