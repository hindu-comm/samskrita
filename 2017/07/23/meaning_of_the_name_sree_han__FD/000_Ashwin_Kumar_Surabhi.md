Hi all,

  

i need some help regarding naming of our son.

We are planning to name our boy as 'sree han'.

We liked it, but we are not sure about it's meaning.

someone told me it's meaning is "vishnu".

  

I want to check it's meaning, before we name him.

I would be grateful if someone could help me.

  

Thanks

Ashwin
