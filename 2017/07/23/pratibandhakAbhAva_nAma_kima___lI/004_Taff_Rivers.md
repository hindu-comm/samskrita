Mandar,  
  
Re. pratibandhakābhāva  
  
 When it comes to matters of 'evidence', one of the acceptable means is 'proof from non-existence'.  
  
 But just what constitutes proof, will depend on one of two differing audiences.  
  
  
In Vedānta - bhakti  
  
 'since there are no mice, therefore there must be cats here'  
  
 is regarded as evidence.  
  
  
Gaṅgeśa's Tattvacintāmaṇi - anumāna  
  
 'since there are no mice, therefore there must be cats here'  
  
 is an unacceptable logical inference or nigraha-sthāna.  
  
Regards,  
 Taff
