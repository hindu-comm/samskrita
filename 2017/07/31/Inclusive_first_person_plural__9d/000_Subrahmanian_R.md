Sir,

  

In the following Line in Bhagawadgita

  

अन्ये च बहव: शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविता: 1.9 is the word

मदर्थ used in the sense of inclusive first person.

That is to say, do I understand that Sanjaya tells Dhritarashtra - there are many warriors assembled here who are ready to sacrifice their lives for *our* sake and not for *my sake.*

  

Namaskaram
