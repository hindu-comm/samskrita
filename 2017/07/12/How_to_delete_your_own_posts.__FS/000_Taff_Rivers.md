All,  
  
 Here's a tip that may sometime come in handy.  
  
Google groups allows its signed in members to delete their own post(s).  
And at any time, not just during the time of original submission.  
  
Here's how.  
 On the top right-hand side of your message, click on the little drop down icon.  
 There you will find an item, labelled ''Delete post'.  
  
Taff,
