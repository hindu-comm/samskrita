SL,  
  
 I appreciate that you are a busy person.  
  
But, please could provide some info, as to which particular message you are responding to, not to mention who you are addressing.  
  
 Also, please bear in mind that since Sanskrit has millenium's worth of alternate usages for each and every single word in its lexicon, commentators make use of paraphrase and clay pots etc. by way of resolving ambiguity that comes from multiple word senses.  
  
Meanwhile, such as I, are faced with an hour or two's worth of ***anumāna***!  
  
Regards,  
  
 Taff
