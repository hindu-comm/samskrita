Irene,  
  
 As the professor, informs us. IITS Koeln has a number of options, including online interface in Devanagari/ Roman Unicode UTF-8 text, and downloadable versions.  
  
It turns out to have a variety of interfaces, scans and text formats, but you will have to explore them to determine exactly what they can for you, and how they work.  
  
The 'new 2016 'interface for example, does not have a drop down icon in the default Dictionary menu item, you have to type something (anything) into that box to get at that (big) drop down list of dictionaries.  
  
Happy go lucky is the traveler.
