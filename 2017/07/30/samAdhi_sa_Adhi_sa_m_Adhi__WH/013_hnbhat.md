Yes. Vacaspatya also refers to another dictionary in the same site available online as SKD. You need not transliterate but option is available to get roman Unicode in both.

Professor,  
  
 Thank you. I now have received that post.  
  
That is a now much transliterating for me to do to gain access to this timeless wisdom!  
  
Please confirm 'SKD' as being Sabdakalpadruma dictionary at IITS Koeln - <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de>  
I assume that the given Page refs. apply to that work?  
  
As to 'Vacaspatya'. Are these Vācaspati Miśra's works?  
  
I have Miśra's *Tattva-vaiśāradī* on [Yogasūtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogasutra "Yogasutra"), as included in J H Woods' work on the YS at Harvard.  
but not his *Miśra's Tattvabindu* which would be the relevant work as regards interpreting meanings?  
of which the only downloadable *Tattvabindu* I can find is a PDF in Devanagari, which does not lend itself to easy transliterating.  
  
Best regards,
