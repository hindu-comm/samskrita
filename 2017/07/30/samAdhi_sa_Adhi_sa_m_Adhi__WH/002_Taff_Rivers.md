RamanaMurthy,  
  
 I do of course mean **Patañjali**'s YS and not **Pāṇini'**s!**  
  
**In the context of the YS then, **samādhi** is the *result* of restraining the senses, and contemplation is a part of that *activity*.  
It is a state, not an activity.  
A state, in the sense that wet clay undergoes a material change of *state* into solid ceramic, as a pot or building block - by the *action* of baking - so does consciousness change into the *state of* ** Samādhi**.  
  
To this westerner's mind, getting **samādhi** to read as 'the state of being a receptacle' then makes the work (the YS) a *practical instruction manual*, rather than an academic work of philosophy. In a any case it certainly not a poetic work.
