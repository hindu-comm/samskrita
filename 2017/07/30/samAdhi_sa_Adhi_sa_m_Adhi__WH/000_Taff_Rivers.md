Learned ones,  
  
 **samādhi** = **sa** + **ā**+**dhi** ==> **sa** + **m** + **ā**+**dhi**?  
  
From the viewpoint of a follower of the **anuśāsana**, that is, one who actually carries out the instructions,  
the term needs to be clearly expressed.  
  
To that end I venture that term '**samādhi**' as employed by **Pāṇini** in his renowned YS, be deconstructed as above.  
  
**sa**, being an indiclinable, carrying the locative sense 'with'  
 and  
**ā-dhi**, being a receptacle.  
  
Thus to be interpreted as ' the state of a receptacle' - as the receptacle itself, without it normal contents, i.e. without thoughts etc., thus being pure consciousness itself?  
  
My reasoning being based on information from the MW.  
  
7. **sa**  
 • ***ind***. (***connected with*** saha, ***sam***, sama, and occasionally in, BhP. standing for saha with instr.) an inseparable prefix expressing 'junction', 'conjunction', '***possession***' (as opp. to a priv.), 'similarity', 'equality'.  
 • and when compounded with nouns to form adjectives and adverbs it may be translated by '***with***', 'together or along with', 'accompanied by', 'added to', 'having', 'possessing', 'containing', 'having the same'.  
 • \[cf. sa-kopa, sāgni, sa-bhāya, sa-droṇa, sa-dharman, sa-varṇa\].; or it may = 'ly', as in sa-kopam, 'angrily', sopadhi, 'fraudulently'), ṚV. &c. &c.  
 • \[cf. Lat. sim in simplex; sem in semel, semper Eng. same.\] \[1111,2\]  
  
1. **ā-dhi**  
 • m. (for 2. see p. 139, col. 2) ***a receptacle***, BhP. xi, 13, 33.  
 • place, situation, L.  
 • foundation, Nyāyam.  
 • a pledge, deposit, pawn, mortgage , ṚV. Mn. Yājñ.  
 • hire, rent, Āp.  
 • an attribute, title, epithet (cf. upādhi), L. \[138,2\]
