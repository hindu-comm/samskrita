Irene,  
  
Scanned PDF in Devanagari? iti Irene  
  
 I am having to exercise all my yogic powers to fill in all the blanks, but am I to understand that you would like me to provide a URL of a certain downloadable scanned PDF Devanagari document titled *Tattvabindu* by the famous Vācaspati Miśra'?  
  
If so, one such, found bundled with source text that he makes reference to, is to be had from:  
  
<https://ia801606.us.archive.org/21/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.329876/2015.329876.Tattva-Bindu.pdf>  
  
The scan is quite clear.  
  
Regards,  
  
 Taff Rivers
