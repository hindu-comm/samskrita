Professor,  
  
 Thank you. I now have received that post.  
  
That is a now much transliterating for me to do to gain access to this timeless wisdom!  
  
Please confirm 'SKD' as being Sabdakalpadruma dictionary at IITS Koeln - <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de>  
I assume that the given Page refs. apply to that work?  
  
As to 'Vacaspatya'. Are these Vācaspati Miśra's works?  
  
I have Miśra's *Tattva-vaiśāradī* on [Yogasūtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogasutra "Yogasutra"), as included in J H Woods' work on the YS at Harvard.  
but not his *Miśra's Tattvabindu* which would be the relevant work as regards interpreting meanings?  
of which the only downloadable *Tattvabindu* I can find is a PDF in Devanagari, which does not lend itself to easy transliterating.  
  
Best regards,
