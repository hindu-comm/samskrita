Dear list

  

Wish you all a happy Guru Purnima. Some of you may be interested in my short article titled “On Guru Purnima: Thirty-four meanings of the word ‘Guru’”:

  

<http://www.opindia.com/2017/07/on-guru-purnima-thirty-four-meanings-of-the-word-guru/>  

  

The article is written keeping the laypersons (those with little or no Sanskrit knowledge) in mind. Those interested in the Sanskrit citations can refer to the corresponding[thread](https://twitter.com/MisraNityanand/status/883863911388258304)and[post](https://www.facebook.com/nityanand.misra/posts/1367696863347389)on Twitter and Facebook respectively.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
