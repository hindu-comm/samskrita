Dear all,  
  

I have decided to improve my Hindi, as I am tired of slow and tense reading, and I need more and more Hindi these days. I'd like to find Sanskrit - Hindi parallel texts to read.  
  

This one looks good:

Please recommend good quality Sanskrit - Hindi texts. By that I mean careful translation and reputable publisher.  

  

Many thanks,  

Irene
