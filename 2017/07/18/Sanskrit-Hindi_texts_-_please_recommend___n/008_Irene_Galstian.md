Looked at the previously linked Gita Sadhak Sanjivani in more detail. On the one hand, it has the convenience of translating single words into Hindi. This is convenient and time-saving.  

However, this book is written in fluent Hindi and aimed at people who already know Hindi well. The main intent here is analysis and commentary, not translation as such. Great book, but I'm not at the right level yet.  

Right now I need to find good Hindi translations of Sanskrit texts I already know. This way I can see how Sanskrit meaning is reflected into Hindi sentence structure.
