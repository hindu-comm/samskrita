Sadly, Prabhupada's 'translations' can't be counted as such. He's too busy pushing ideology to pay due attention to the text.  
  

If someone knows of a good Sanskrit - Hindi edition of the Gita, please tell me the details, and I'll get it. For example, one of my students just sent me this link:  
  
<https://archive.org/details/Mahabharata04SanskritHindiPanditRamnarayanGitaPress>  
  

If you're blessed with both good Sanskrit and good Hindi, please look at this translation and advise whether the translation corresponds precisely to the Sanskrit original. If it does, my problem is solved.
