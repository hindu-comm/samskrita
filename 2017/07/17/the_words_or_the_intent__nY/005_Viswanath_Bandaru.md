If bhakti in desired quantity exists, no specific mantra is required. It however is not practically possible to find such bhakti. If one has such bhakti, he/she would not have desires, and know that they will be taken care of.

  

If mantra is employed for a specific purpose, it will yield results, but needs correct method to be followed. The correct method, here, includes right pronunciation.
