II opine that this kind of anomaly in respect of the word BRAHMA, could also be observed in the case of CIHNA (a sign or symbol), where people write correctly as CIHNA but pronounce it as CINHA.  And, after getting themselves with this pronunciation as CINHA, some people are seen using this form CINHA even while writing too.  This kind of practice is widely seen over the Hindi belt where even some Scholars also are not free from this mistake!
