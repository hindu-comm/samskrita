I do not know how far the book cited above, titled [यक्षप्रश्न](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=643NDAAAQBAJ), should be considered a reliable guide by serious students of Sanskrit. In the chapter called 'YAKSHA PRASHNA THE STORY' that follows the the page 'Addendum - This edition' (the book has no page-numbering, hence this somewhat awkward manner of referencing) the following verse has been printed in Devanagari:

  

मा तात साहसं कार्शीर्मम पूर्वपरिग्रह:

प्रश्नानुक्त्वा तु माद्रेय पिबस्व च हरस्व च

  

One can immediately notice that it should have been correctly shown as

  

मा तात साहसं कार्षीर्मम पूर्वपरिग्रह:

प्रश्नानुक्त्वा तु माद्रेय पिबस्व च हरस्व च

  

A little further is another verse appearing as blow:

  

इदं समुत्थान समगमं महत्

पितु: च पुत्रस्य च कीर्तिवर्धनं

पठन्नर: स्याद् विजीतेद्रियो वशी

सपुत्रपौत्र: शतवर्षभाग् भवेत्

  

Glaring errors are jumping out here.

  

I would not be willing to put my trust in anything in which a Sanskrit text has been so carelessly proof-read. I would, instead, rely on MW.
He shows the word’ब्रह्मन्’ in the Roman script as 'brahman' and does not hint anywhere about a variant in its pronunciation.

  

I think is a peculiarity of the Sanskrit language that the letter ह् never appears as the second letter joining any other letter as the first letter. ह् always appears as the first letter and न् म् य् र् ल् व् may appear as second letters as inअपह्नुति, ब्रह्मन्, ह्य्:, ह्रस्व, ह्राद आह्वान. The correct pronunciation of all such letters is ह् first, followed by न् म् य् र् ल् व् . (It is a shortcoming of my Devanagari software that in अपह्नुति, theउकार appears in the wrong place.)
