ks,  
  
 In understanding such matters, it is essential to realise that Sanskrit is a *specialised* language.  
*Designed* for use in formal situations that concern the divine.  
  
That is, for ritual and ceremonial purposes.  
  
Turn to original source and avoid the many second-hand, misrepresented versions.  
  
Having said that, I am given to understand that even the renowned authority, **Panini** contains an ambiguity or two in his work.  
  
But beware, for endless are the debates of the grammarians...
