These aren't a case of 'more exceptions'. It's just that combinations like hm or hn

are likely to be inverted and turned into mh and nh by people whose interaction with Sanskrit is

of a more casual nature. Just because something is published doesn't make it reliable.

If you consult reputable sources, you'll find no such 'exceptions'. In Sanskrit,

one pronounces exactly what one sees.

If you are looking for intricacies, Sanskrit has plenty of them, but not in its pronunciation.
