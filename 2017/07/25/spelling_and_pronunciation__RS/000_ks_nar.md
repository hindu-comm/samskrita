Namaskarams to all !

  

I have great regard for Sanskrit language, but few clarifications:

  

(1). Most of the languages have "Eka vachan(singular)" and "Bahu vachan (plural)". But Sanskrit has in also 'dvi vachan'( 2 quantity plural).

Kindly mail if any reason/metric for this. Any other languages have this?

  

(2). Among the three words, Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwara, word for "Brahma" is pronounced as "Bramha" but spelt as "Brahma". Just interested if this is a random occurring or any reason/metric for this spelling/pronunciation anomaly.

  

  

regards.
