The dual number can be relevant to any two entities =>

1.  Guru and Shishya. The Guru also learns even when teaching. More
    challenging the Shishya, more does the Guru learn. A child with
    challenged abilities is so much challenging for the teacher of such
    children ! 2.  Husband and wife. This mantra is a very good marriage vow and prayer
    for all the life after marriage. This prayer is a good deterrent for
    any thought of divorce any time and is a good initiation into
    cohesive outlook and conduct of life. 3.  Speaker and his audience. The mantra is apt even for one-to-many
    interaction. 4.  When leaders of two nations meet. This mantra is possibly the only
    "agreement" the leaders need to agree to.
5.  So, any two entities, what one may think of - even two strangers
    meeting each other for the first time. That way this mantra
    signifies the concept of "fraternity", which is said to have become
    the by-word during French revolution.
