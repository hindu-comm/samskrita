\>In this context (नौ अधीतम्), नौ is used in the sense of आवयोः, 'of both of us'. In the Tritiya vibhakti of अस्मद्, आवाभ्याम् does not have an alternative form. It can be considered as an आर्षप्रयोग, if it is in Tritiya vibhakti.

It is not Tritiya vibhakti, but षष्ठी विभक्ति द्विवचनम् as Nagaraj Paturi ha indicated in his correction in the next message.

तेजस्वी is the form in nominative singular of masculine gender, but here it is neuter gender तेजस्वि adjective of अधीतम्. Hence it is not आर्षप्रयोग.
