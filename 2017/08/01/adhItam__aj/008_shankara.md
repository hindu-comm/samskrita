Namaste,

  

In this context (नौ अधीतम्), नौ is used in the sense of आवयोः, 'of both of us'. In the Tritiya vibhakti of अस्मद्, आवाभ्याम् does not have an alternative form. It can be considered as an आर्षप्रयोग, if it is in Tritiya vibhakti.

  

I have question here - Is the word तेजस्वि (instead of तेजस्वी) an आर्षप्रयोग?  

  

regards  
shankara
