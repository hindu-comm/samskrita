"May   
\>Three sahavIryam karvAvahai...here the "karta; changes...Let we two (AvAm) viiryam karvAvahai...(I use Dr Kapildev Dvivedi's book PrauDha-rachanAnuvAdakaumudi, and in that I could not find dhatu, lakAr, purush and vachanam of "karavAvahai". So I broke up karvAvahai to karau + Avhai. looked up in [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) the meaning of 'kara". Among many meanings I found the entry :" करkaram.symbolical expression for the number two

  
\>;.  
\>Then I looked up Avahai. Among many meanings it gave one meaning as follows:आवहते { आवह् }Avahate { Avah }...verb...drive or lead near or towards  
\>Thus the third part of the mantra mentioned by me above meant (perhaps!) "(AvAm) karau sahavIryam Avahai". (AvAm= 'hum dono', and AvAm karau=' hum dono hi'.!) ....

Good fancy work. But करौ+आवहै would be joined as करावावहै and not करवावहै!

.And theरूपचन्द्रिका by श्री. ब्रह्मानन्द त्रिपाठी published by चौखंबा सुरभारती प्रकाशन, वाराणसी findकरवावहै given as कृ-धातुः (तनादिः आत्मनेपदी) \| तस्य लोटि उत्तमपुरुषे द्विवचनम् \| Obviously कर्तृपदम् is आवाम्.

कुरुताम् कुर्वाताम् कुर्वताम्   
कुरुष्व कुर्वाथाम् कुरुध्वम्   
करवै करवावहै करवामहै

\>FOUR The last "nau" (AvayoH, this I owe to you Bhat Sir, because some mails earlier you had clarified nau as AvayoH) refers to vIryam. Thus the last part would mean  
\>"nau (AvayoH) "vIryam तेजस्वि cha adhItam astu"  
\>The mantra would thus translate as:  
\>May the (unknown) higher power protect us both.  
\>May the samehigher power nourish us both.  
\>Let us both drive (go) towards viryam........vigour (to study scriptures!)  
\>May our viryam be tejasvi and adhItam.

I don't understand your reasoning, when नौ is explained in the first three occasions correctly to take it into 4th sentence.

\_\_\_Anyhow you can get every meaning in dictionary for every word in the Shanti Mantra given by Abhyankar in his site below:
