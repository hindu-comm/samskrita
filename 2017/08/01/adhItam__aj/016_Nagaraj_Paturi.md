It is the guru and s'ishya. The whole beauty of the mantra is in the dual number. How beautiful to imagine the two 'singing' it together! One of the best examples to understand the justification for dual number.

  

We have many modern songs sung by a couple together, looking into each others eyes, smiling, enjoying the togetherness, making promises to each other, expressing wishes of long lived togetherness and so on.

  

This is on those lines, but between guru and s'ishya!
