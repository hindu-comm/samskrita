***First Story on**Kalidasa***



**Princess Vidyottama was of marriageable age. She had decided to marry only a man who was wiser than her. The wise men brought the marriage proposal to the King. They also mentioned thatKalidasawas a very learned man who was on a month long maun-vrat (the vow of silence). It was considered that maun-vrat brought purity of mind and speech and was practised by many sages in those days. The King was impressed by the beauty of the young man and the praises from the wise men of his court. However, Vidyottama was not going to be satisfied before she tested his learning, herself. A debate was arranged where Vidyottama andKalidasawould only communicate through gestures.**



**The princess raised her index finger .Kalidasa, quickly replied by showing two fingers. He had thought that Vidyottama was meaning to poke him in one eye. He was obviously thinking of outdoing her. Actually she had indicated that God is one without a second.Kalidasa’s answer was wisely interpreted as the truth has two parts the Supreme God and the individual soul. She was surprised by this wisdom. Venturing further, she showed her five fingers to indicate five senses.Kalidasathought she was about to slap him so he showed his fist. This time Vidyottama thought it to mean that controlling the five senses can lead to ultimate greatness. Thus impressed, she then agreed to marryKalidasa.**

***Second Story on**Kalidasa***

****

**According to Indian tradition,Kālidāsahad left his home in pursuit of knowledge and to become worthy of his intellectual wifeVidyottamā( "epitome of erudition"). When he returned from this conquest, his wife asked, "asti kaścit vāgviśeṣaḥ? (अस्तिकश्चित्वाग्विशेषः)"—**

**"Is there any erudition which should prompt me to extend aspecialwelcome to you?"**



**Kālidāsaimpressed his wife with the answer she expected and over the next few years created three great epics,each beginning with one of the three words uttered by his wife:**



**'Asti'— Kumārasambhava,**

**  
Verse:**

** astiuttarasyāṃdiśidevatātmāhimālayonāmanagādʰirājaḥ  
asti\~uttarasyām\~diśidevatā=ātmā/hima=ālayasnāmanaga=adʰirājas\~**



**'Kaścit'—Meghadūta,**

**Verse: **

**kaścitkāntāvirahaguruṇāsvādʰikārapramattaḥ  
v.l.:svādhikārātpramattaḥ.**

**'Vāk'—Raghuvaṃśa**



**Verse ;**

**Vagarthaviva sampriktau vagarthah pratipattaye \| Jagatah pitarau vande parvathiparameshwarau \|\| – Raghuvamsha 1.1**



***Third story on Kalidasa*****

***  
***

**Why Kalidasa is called Deepashika Kalidasa? Here is the answer.**

****

**One part of Raghuvamsam details the swayamvaram of Princess Indumati. Aja, the son of Raghu is a candidate in the swayamvara.**

****

**Many, many kings and Princes are waiting to take the hand of Indumati, each waiting for a nod of approval from her.She looks at each one of them and passes on to the next till she sees Aja (Sri Ram's grandfather).**

****

**There is only one Kalidasa to describe this scene.**

****

**He compares to the scene to what happens when a man with a bright torch walks along a dark street. As the man approaches a building, the light from his torch starts brightening up the building - closer he is to the building, more well-lit the building becomes; and once he goes ahead, the structure fades and merges with the darkness. And this happens as he passes by each building. This was what happened at the swayamwaram. The prince was all smiles when Indumati approached him and when she ignored him his face faded and he too became "one of them" who lost.**

****

**For this simile alone, in the literary world of next many generations
he came to be known as"Deepashika"Kalidasan.**

****

**In " Megaduta ", Kalidasa writes as if he is on the clouds and gives an aerial view of the lands below.**

****

**In "Kumara Sambhavam" he writes about the meeting of and wedding of Parvati with Parameshwara. He had never gone up the Himalyas, or above the clouds or been to the swayamwaram; but he could bring the events to our eyes. Such was Kalidasa's writing skill.**

**Sakuntala became popular in the West after Goethe—national poet of Germany praised it.**

  

**Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe, German poet, dramatist, biologist, theoretical physicist and polymath expressed his admiration in 1792 for Shakulntala as:  
  
Willst du die Blüthe des frühen, die Früchte des späteren Jahres,  
Willst du, was reizt und entzückt, willst du was sättigt und nährt,  
Willst du den Himmel, die Erde, mit Einem Namen begreifen;  
Nenn’ ich, Sakuntala, Dich, and so ist Alles gesagt.  
  
**

**—Goethe**

**Wouldst thou the young year's blossoms and the fruits of its decline  
And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed,  
Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name combine?  
I name thee, OSakuntala! and all at once is said.**

**—translation by E.B. Eastwick**

**  
It means - If you wish to see the young flowers of Spring and the ready to pluck fruits of Summer at once; or if you wish to see that object which pleases, hypnotises, delights and quenches you at once; or if you wish to see the earth and heaven in one look; I invoke the name ofShakuntalaand all quests are answered at once

***A sad footnote*—**

**  
**

**The house in which Kalidasa was born in Ujjain is very badly maintained—just as Saint Tyagaraja’s birth place in Tiruvaiyaru. I do hope the position has improved now.**
