आनन्दाश्रम is a name quite familiar to the students of Sanskrit literature and shastras. as a reputable publisher of Sanskrit book. It was active towards the later years of the 19th century.   

  

It was founded by Mahadeo Chimnaji Apte (1845-1894), who rose from a family of very poor circumstances into one of the successful lawyers of Bombay and Poona, with a large and lucrative practice. He was interested in the preservation and propagation of old Sanskrit manuscripts and established Anadrashram as a charitable trust, whose objects were gathering of manuscripts from families of old Pandits and editing/printing them. (144 publications of Anadashram in the digital form are available for free download [at this address.](http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2013/04/anandashram-sanskrit-series-anandashram-samskrita-granthavali).
More may be available in archive.otg, DLI or in [google.com](http://google.com).)

  

Mahadeo Chimnaji Apte became a Sanyasi in later life and after his death, his mortal body was consigned to the samadhi built in the center garden of Anandashram. The building of Anandashram still stands in the crowded center of the city of Pune on its original spot. A photo of its entrance (obviously renovated in recent days) is shown below.

  

Hari Narayan Apte (1864-1919), a progressive Marathi novelist, whose famous novels were devoted to issues such as women's education, condition of Hindu widows in traditional families, was a nephew of Mahadeo Chimanaji Apte. Narayan Apte, hanged with Nathuram Godse as the co-conspirator in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, was also a relative.
