".......A meaningful prayer is yet another feature of the Vājasaneyī Saṁhitā. The following mantra was regarded as the Vaidika national anthem and did ignite many minds during freedom fight.  
  
Ā Brahman brāhmaṇo brahmavarcasī jāyatāṁ ā rāṣṭre rājanyaḥ śūra iṣavyaḥ ativyādhī mahāratho jāyatāṁ dogdhrī dhenuḥ voḍhānaḍvānāśūḥ saptiḥ purandhiryoṣā jiṣṇū ratheṣṭhāḥ sabheyo yuvāsya yajamānsya vīro jāyatāṁ nikāme nikāme naḥ parjanyo varṣtu phalavatyo na oṣadhayḥ pacyantāṁ yogakṣemo naḥ kalpatāṁ\|\|22.22  
  
(Tr.- O Brahman! let the Brāhmaṇa be shine with his spiritual radiance in this nation, the Kshatriya be brave archer and great warrior. In this nation let the cow be milky, the bull be strong, the horse be speedy, woman be alert, a warrior be winner, a youth be very good speaker, let a son of this yajamāna be brave. Let there be rain when needed. Let the trees bear fruit. Let our living be happy and prosperous)...."
