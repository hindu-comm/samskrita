Hi can any one here help me in developing Natural Language processing Project for Sanskrit.  
I am planning to start a project for SanskritNLP have done alot of NLP for english.  
But wan to give it a try for Sanskrit.  
  
If we be able to generate one such project working seamlessly then we can turn it into a start up and I am sure it will be the best Artifitial Intelligence implemented till time.  
Any help and views will be appreciated.  
Thanks.
