What are thesanskrit equivalents for Silambu & tandai ? Both words are in tamil.

  

Silambu -. A silambu, worn by a woman, is a hollow circular tube, made of[gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), with precious stones or pearls to fill the space, which in turn produce a characteristic sound while walking. Silambus are worn by traditional dancers during performances. This produces a rhythmic, jingling sound in tune with the steps of the dancers. based on this an epic called silappathigaaram was written. It looks like this:

Thandai is the same thing but worn by MEN.

  

Noopura is the nearest word I believe but it basically refers to the anklets.

This is not an anklet but a thing similar to salangai ( worn during bharatanatyam).

  

what could be the best equivalent when coined in sanskrit for these 2
words?

  

thanks
