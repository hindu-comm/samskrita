Dear Group,

  

For the last several days the DLI has been displaying the following notice on its website:

  

> > Dear Users, >
> > We had noticed a few copyright violations, pointed out to us by the > > publishers / copyright owners. This may have happened due to the > > mistake by some of the scanning centres. Our intention is not to put > > any books which are within copyright on the website and hence we > > have requested the scanning centres to go through their scanned > > books and ensure that they are out of copyright. They are working > > hard towards this. Once they are cleared the website will be back in > > action. Till then kindly bear with us.  
> > > Inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.
> > > 
> > > > ## -- DLI Team > > > > 

  

It is not known how long will it take to get over this problem. In the meantime, we should count our blessings as [archive.org](http://archive.org) is running a mirror of the DLI and it seems to be unaffected by this problem.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar..
