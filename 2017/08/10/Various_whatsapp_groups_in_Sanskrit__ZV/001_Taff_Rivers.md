KN,  
  
My Desktop browser Cliqz, is reporting some kind a security problem on the site you mention, viz.  
  
 "The owner of [docs.google.com](http://docs.google.com) has configured their website improperly.  
 To protect your information from being stolen, Cliqz has not connected to this website."  
  
  
I have not tried access from my Mobile...  
  
Best,
