Sanju,  
  
Yes, that site IS most probably quite safe - ***so far. But...  
  
***As ever, the 'net is rather a complex entity, after all, it was designed to withstand nuclear warefare!  
  
 **Cliqz**, is a new browser. Mine has detected that the web site in question generates a spread sheet on the fly, which it then returns to the caller as a PDF document.  
**And** that the site *conditionally, allows for that underlying spreadsheet to be edited.*  
Spreadsheets can include a backdoor security flaw that hackers ***could*** exploit for ransomware etc.  
  
And passed on to the PDF download, which can also contain malware.  
  
Accessed, while not in conjunction with such as Kaspersky's antivirus software, that malware gets through.  
  
Then again, as an added complication, there's that 's' for secure in the ***https*** of that **URL**, which requires the *caller* to have encryption turned on at his end.  
But that can be turned off on the users end...  
*  
*I sometimes think that all Internet users should have to pass a driving test!  
  
 Regards,
