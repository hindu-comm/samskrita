The series published some of the most important and valuable Jain works, and even today its publications are considered as benchmarks in Indological publishing.

  

This series was founded by Pandit Nathuram Premi in 1915. In the late 1950's in failing health, Pt. Premi decided to hand over the publishing of the series to someone else. Eventually, it was decided to hand over the series to Bharatiya Jnanapitha, Varanasi. After that, the series came to a halt. None of its books are available in the market today. They were never reprinted. Nor were any new texts printed in that series. Even getting photocopies of the books is difficult.

  

A great treasure has been lost through neglect and modern man's apathy towards jñāna.

  

Pandit Nathuram Premi worked on an honorary basis as the publisher of the Manikachandra Jain Granthamala all his life.

  

The 20th century with its access to modern print technology brought about a watershed in Indian publishing. A spate of Indian texts were published. Religious texts were printed on a large scale.

The Jain community also became awakened to the possibility of perpetuating their textual tradition. While Digambara Jains were the first off the block with their first published canonical works in 1905, one finds that there is a serious shortage of academic Digambara Jain publications. There is almost no fresh academic work being done and what work is being done is not of the same caliber.

  

After the death of giants in the field of Jain scholarship like Nathuram Premi, Hiralal Jain, AN Upadhye, Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Jugalkishor Mukhtar, JL Jaini, Ajita Prasada Jain, Kamataprasad Jain, Phoolchandra Shastri, Kailashchandra Shastri, Balchandra Shastri and Hiralal Shastri (Sadhumal), there is a paucity of critical scholarship in the Digambara Jain community.  
  
Only now, on 5 August 2016, through the efforts and generosity of Mr Asit & Ms Seema Javeri, an almost complete collection of the MJG has become accessible to scholars in a library built by the Javeris in the memory of their great-grandfather, Seth Panachand Javeri, who was the elder brother of Seth Manikchandra Javeri. This library is known as the Seth Panachand International Jain Library and shall soon be opened to the public. It was inaugurated on 5 August, 2016 by Prof Dr John Cort, one of the leading Jain scholars in the world.
