Let the Polymer developer beware!  
  
From a users viewpoint, StarDict whether in its on-line or download forms can be quite useful, but can suffer from quality issues, not to mention copyright issues.  
  
Developers however, should be most aware that the Polymer system is somewhat browser-centric (Chrome), which confines the developer not only to just the one browser, but to an ever receding past.  
Making for hard earned programming skills to quickly become obsolete.  
  
Not only are there more widely known database systems, but also much more flexible IDE's.  
For instance, Microsoft's Visual Studio.  
Which, despite its name, is not confined to Windows systems, generated output being multi/cross platform capable.  
This fully backward compatible series of software, includes tons of tools for compatibility testing so that you can see how your apps run on more than 300 devices and browsers.  
Thanks to its flexibility, Visual Studio is a great tool for both students and professionals.  
  
It's free for non-commercial use.
