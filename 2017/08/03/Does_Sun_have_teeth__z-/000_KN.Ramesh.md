Sun is called asपूषा which means he has no teeth. This is already stated in krishna yajur veda thus:

पूषा: प्रविष्टमाण: \| अदन्त गोहि \|  

  

It seems he mocked at a rishi & rishi slapped him and all his teeth fell out.

Then the rishi blessedhim stating Surya will bless more if the nivedya is given in semi-liquid form.

Even the coconut is to be from tender coconut.

That is why his havir bhagam is to be given in the flourपिष्ट form.

  

For the explanations in detail please refer at 44:37 at the link:

My questions are:

Is there a story of Sun losing his teeth?

Does the wordपूषा mean teethless?

  

  

  

  

``` स्व॒स्ति नः॑ पू॒षा वि॒श्ववे॑दाः। स्व॒स्ति न॒स्तार्क्ष्यो॒ अरि॑ष्टनेमिः।स्व॒स्ति नो॒ बृह॒स्पति॑र्दधातु॥ ```
