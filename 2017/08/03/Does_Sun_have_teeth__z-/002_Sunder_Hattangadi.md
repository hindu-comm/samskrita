"...In the Purānas Pushan occupies a far less exalted position. It seems almost like a burlesque to see him, who in the Vedas is reverently approached as the giver of good to his worshippers, described as being obliged to feed upon gruel, because his teeth have been knocked out of his mouth. The earliest form of the legend describing this event is found in the Taittiriya Sanhita. Rudra, the name by which Siva was then known, not being invited to a great sacrifice that Daksha, his father-in-law, was celebrating, in his anger shot an arrow which pierced the sacrificial victim. Pushan ate his share, and in doing so broke his teeth. In describing Daksha, ‡ an account of this sacrifice will be given. In the "Vishnu Purāna" Pushan appears as one of the Ādityas...."

in the Brāhmaṇas Pūshan is represented as having lost  
his teeth and feeding on a kind of gruel, whence he is  
called karambhād;  
  
Pūsha-danta-hara,  
as, m. ‘taking away Pūshan's teeth,’ an epithet of Śiva.

Sun is called aspooshaa which means he has no teeth. This is already stated in krishna yajur veda thus:

pooshaah pravishtmaanh \| adnat gohi \|  

  

It seems he mocked at a rishi & rishi slapped him and all his teeth fell out.

Then the rishi blessedhim stating Surya will bless more if the nivedya is given in semi-liquid form.

Even the coconut is to be from tender coconut.

That is why his havir bhagam is to be given in the flourpisht form.

  

For the explanations in detail please refer at 44:37 at the link:

My questions are:

Is there a story of Sun losing his teeth?

Does the wordpooshaa mean teethless?
