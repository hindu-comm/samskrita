Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Sri Rama Navami** falls on **Wednesday (05-Apr-2017),** I am happy to attach a rare **Ashtottaram** on **Lord Veeraraghava of Kingrihapura (**this **Kshetra** is currently known as **Thiruvallur,** a town near **Chennai** in **Tamil Nadu**).

  

In **Puranic** times, this **Kshetra** was called **Veeksharanya Kshetram** and **Markandeya Puranam** is said to contain eleven chapters on this Kshetra (though it is not to be seen in the print edition of the purana). I presume this **Ashtottaram** is also from the same purana although it is not part of the 11 chapter Mahatmyam.

  

**Thiruvallur Sri Veeraraghava Temple** is one of the **108 Divya Desams** and the main deity is otherwise known as **Vaidya Veeraraghava Perumal**. This temple is considered on the same pedestal as **Vaidheeswaran Koil (**near **Kumbakonam**) for the cure of diseases and ailments. **Sri Vadalur Vallalar** has sung a praise on this Lord and apparently got cured of his stomach ailment.

  

The tank by the side of the temple is known by the name "**hRRittApa nAshini**" (one that destroys all sorrows of the heart after an ablution in this tank).

  

May we pray to **Lord Veeraraghava** on **Sri Rama Navami** day!
