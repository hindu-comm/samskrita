Hi,

  

I am looking for the sanskrit transliterate version of Narada Purana. The only version I have found is on the site of University of GÃ¶ttingen (<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gret_csx.htm#NaradaP>), but that is not accurate enough because the word boundaries are not always marked, and the first chapter is missing.

Do you know any edition apart from this?

  

Thank you,

  

Steve
