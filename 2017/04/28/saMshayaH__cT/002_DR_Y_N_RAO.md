First of all, your question itself contains many a mistake! It appears that you have no proper knowledge of Hindi!! What is your mother-tongue?  

  
What you have asked is about 'Causative'. In Causative, one makes some other person to do a thing.  
  

For example:  

पठ् (Root-Verb) = to read  

पठति (Present Tense; Third Person Singular) = He/She reads./is reading.  

पाठयति (Causative) (Present Tense; Third Person Singular) = He/She teaches./is teaching.  
  

नृत् (Root-Verb) = to dance  

नृत्यति (Present Tense; Third Person Singular) = He/She dances./is dancing.  

नर्तयति (Causative) (Present Tense; Third Person Singular) = He/She teaches(causes) some one (to) dance./is teaching(causing) some one (to) dance.  
  

.. and so on...  
  

With best wishes,
