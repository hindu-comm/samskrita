Vasantha,  
  
 Perhaps if you were raise your query in English in addition to Devanagari, replies may be more edyifying for you.  
  
I have been exercising my homemade transliteration software on your text - and it's complaining a lot (:-(.  
Because among other things, commas and question matks are no-nos in Devanagari.  
  
The ? mark is किम् (kim) for example, and it goes at the front.  
  
Regards,  
  
 Taff
