Vasantha,

  
 अहं शिक्षे= I teach or I learn?  
  

First, whatever the language, there is the grammar:  
  
* (You give not one but, two sentences.  
 So, 'How to write **these** sentence**s**'.)*  
  
In either case, you need to determine:  
 the verb,  
 the subject,  
 and the object, if there is one.  
  
***Bear in mind that words all languages have synonyms and connotations, and that it takes two to tango.***  
  
Therefore:  
  
 1. I teach dance.  
  
 (in proper English, I teach dancing)  
  
 But whatever the language:  
  
 The subject is I **aham**  
  
 The object or what you teach is dance, which is a noun  
 and as a noun, the word is *dancing*.  
  
               **nṛtya** or the noun **nṛt**  
  
 The verb is teach.  **śās**  
  
  
 2. I learn dance.  
  
 (in proper English, I am learning to dance)  
  
 Subject is I.    **aham**  
  
 The verb is *learning*.  **prati-√ labh**  
  
  
 What is being learnt is *dance*. as before **nṛtya** or the noun **nṛt  
  
**  
 Now all that remains is to put things the sanskrit way:  
  
 Subject, object, verb...  
  
 ...**and** decline the nouns and conjugate the verb as per the rules of sanskrit grammar...
