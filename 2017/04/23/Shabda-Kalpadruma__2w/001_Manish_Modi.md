The Shabdakalpadruma is an encyclopedic dictionary of Sanskrit words arranged in alphabetical order giving the etymological origin of words according to Paninian grammar. It gives their gender, various meanings and synonyms and illustrates their syntactical usage. It also furnishes the various connotations of each word using citations drawn from various authoritative sources such as the Vedas, the Epics, the Upanishads, the Puranas as well as Sanskrit texts on Tantra, Ayurveda, music, art, astrology, rhetoric and prosody.

  

This renowned Sanskrit lexicon was compiled by a team of Bengali scholars led by Raja Radhakant Deb. Its first volume was published in 1822 while the last one was published in 1856. This classic Sanskrit dictionary and would lend authority and gravitas to any Indological library. This brand new edition has been lavishly published and expensively bound. Since only 150 sets have been published, the price is justified to an extent.

  

However, it would have been so much better if the dictionary had been retyped. The old Nagari typeface is elegant but might be slightly challenging for modern readers. One fervently wishes that the publisher had spent less money on the binding and gold embossing and instead spent it on retyping this fabulous work.

  

Be that as it may, we are proud to make this fine dictionary available to all our readers. As a special incentive, we offer 20% discount to all Sanskrit lovers. In addition, we offer free surface shipping all over India.

  

At Hindi Granth Karyalay, we have been delighting readers since 1912. We are committed to make the best writings on Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism and South Asian Studies available all over the world. Hence, beside our own publications, we stock and sell books from all the major publishers of India. At our bookstore, which is the oldest in Mumbai, we stock thousands of books on various topics such as religion, philosophy, Indology, literature, poetry, dramatics, art, self-help, yoga, children’s literature, alternative medicine, music, cinema and sports.

We carry books in Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, Apabhramsha, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada and Marathi. We have also begun to stock books like graphic novels, popular English novels, etc.

We aim to be a one-stop bookstore that caters to different tastes.

  

These books are available at our bookstore and by mail order. We ship books within India and internationally. 

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
