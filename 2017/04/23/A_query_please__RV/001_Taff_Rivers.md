It is called the *Chandrabindu Virama,  
  
*  "A special case of the *chandra-bindu* that occurs in conjunction with a *virAma*,  
 the word is sounded with the *halanta*, guttural nasal sound instead of the generic, labial 'm'.  
  
  
  
Search Google for *Chandrabindu Virama*  
  
 Your mileage may differ, but from the list of URL's that appear  
 select *Sanskrit for Seekers - Google Book Results  
  
* If all goes well that will bring up a sample page that provides an example from the Isa Upanishad,  
 - scroll down a page for an explanation, which I reproduce here:  
  
  "A special case of the *chandra-bindu* occurs in conjunction with a *virAma*,  
 the word is sounded with the *halanta*, guttural nasal sound instead of the generic, labial 'm'.  
  
As to Panini, I trace the following to ***Pāṇ. 5-2, 36***, but that is for the learned ones to confirm...  
  
 candra-bindu  
 • m. 'moon-like spot', the sign for the nasal.  
 • = candrakita, Bhpr. \[387,1\]  
  
 candrakita  
 • mfn. (g. tārakādi) furnished with brilliant moon-like spots, Kād. iii. 160 (ifc.) \[388,1\]  
  
 tārakādi  
 • (°kād°), a Gaṇa of ***Pāṇ. 5-2, 36***, Gaṇar. 388-391). \[444,1\]  
  
 Hope this helps,
