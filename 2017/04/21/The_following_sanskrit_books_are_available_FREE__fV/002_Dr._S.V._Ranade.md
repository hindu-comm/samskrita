Dear Sir,

Thanks for grateful offer. I am interested in these books.

We are having our website [www.anskritdeepika.org](http://www.anskritdeepika.org) currently with Marathi medium and would like to enhance it with English medium. I am retired professor from Engg. College in Sangli India and the site was developed by my wife Late Mrs. Shubhangi Ranade, who expired last year.

I am currently staying in Sunnyvale with my son.

  

Can you send to following address.

Sushant Ranade

Apt. E-74, 1055, Manet Dr. Sannyvale, CA

Please ask for any clarifications,

  

with regards,

Dr. S. V. Ranade
