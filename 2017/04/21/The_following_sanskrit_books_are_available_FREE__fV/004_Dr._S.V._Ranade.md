Thanks. Sorry for spelling mistake.

Please visit following link to get random Subhashit with Marathi meaning and audio clip.

  

<http://sanskritdeepika.org/displayrandom2.php>  

  

You can see new Subhashit with refresh page.  

  

I shall pay the postal and other expenses for books. If you desire, I shall return the books after taking notes.

With regards,

S. V. Ranade
