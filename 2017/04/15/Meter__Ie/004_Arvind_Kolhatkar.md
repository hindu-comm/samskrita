I haveवृत्तरत्नाकर of केदारभट्ट with me but the book I mostly rely on is a more modern Hindi text calledछन्दप्रभाकर by जगन्नाथ प्रसाद ’भानु’, which has gone through several editions since it was first printed in 1894.

  

A Marathi book calledवृत्तदर्पण by परशुराम बल्लाळ गोडबोले, a hugely popular book in schools till the 1950s, when Vrittas used to be taught in vernacular schools, is also very helpful. It was first published in the 1870s and went through 17 editions till 1920. 

  

There are several other books that I know of, including CP Brown's 'Sanskrit Prosody'. All these books are available on the internet in some place or another. One only has to diligently look for them.
