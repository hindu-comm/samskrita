Dear all,

My nephew's son who is studying in 9th standard has a summer vacation of 50 days. He wants to learn Sanskrit during the vacation right from the beginning (He knows the script).He needs a Sanskrit teacher who has to go to my nephew's residence (Jayanagar, Bangalore) and teach the boy. I shall be grateful for any type of help in identifying a suitable teacher. Email directly to me would meet the needs. I hope I am not mis-using this august group's medium.

Regards,

Murthy
