As the derived word काश्मीर, literally “belonging to Kashmir”, refers to saffron and grapes in Sanskrit, there is no doubt that the कश्मीर in Sanskrit texts refers to the Kashmir of today. The Kashmir of today has been famous for saffron for a long time.

  

Whether the boundaries of the कश्मीर country reffered to in Mahabharata were limited to the valley or not is a different question to which I do not know the answer.
