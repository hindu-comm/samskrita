Nityanand Misra,  
  
 To repeat my inquiry: ***Who***, named the region?  
  
Because only when we have determined exactly who the people were - the people who so named the region - would we be able look to their vocabulary and ascertain the factual information.  
  
  
To that end I have now tracked down the following:  
  
"The oldest Hindu texts such as the Vedas, Upanishads and Mahabharata ***were composed in the Punjab*** or nearby region and therefore ***indirectly influenced*** *the entire South Asian region through time*." **\***  
  
  
So looking up 'kash' and 'mir' in the ***Punjabi*** of that time,*  
* a first, quick look around: determines that 'mir' is a persons proper name, that of a real person ,as opp. to the somewhat metaphoric one. *  
  
"**Shah Mir** became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Salatin-i-Kashmir or Swati dynasty.\[5\]"  
  
That leaves 'Kash'' ...  
  
  
* best regards,  
  
Taff,*  
  
 I see neither saffron nor grapes, not even any of today's 'mountain goats' ...(-:)
