Nityanand Misra,  
  
 Wie geht es Ihnen.  
  
I have run an objective eye over 'The etymology of the word Kashmir' of yours.  
And find the question surely is, who, and with whose lexicon, ***actually named the region*** (as opp. to the valley)?  
  
Specifically, what is the esteemed Author's grounds for asserting the 'Kashmir' of today, is of today's (i.e. Classical) Sanskrit lexicon?  
  
Only then would the Sanskrit etymological argument be worthy of consideration, but so far it remains just speculation?  
  
Viz.  
The Sanskrit word for 'Kashmir' is kashmira (kasmira/कश्मीर) or kashmiri as a feminine adj.,  
which is described in the MBh simply as 'the country Kaśmīra'.  
***at time when it was still very much just a valley.***  
  
To explain my argument:  
  
As you say, prior to 1820, there's the Persian valley 'Kashmir' - and its meaning as from the Persian lexicons.  
  
But then we have the odd territorial punch-ups over the *region* 'Kashmir' - which *includes* the aforementioned valley.  
  
The two Amritsar treaties:  
 Treaty of Amritsar, 1809, an agreement between the British East India Company and Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh empire  
 Treaty of Amritsar, 1846, a treaty formalizing the arrangements in *the Treaty of Lahore* between the British East India Company and Maharaja Gulab Singh Dogra after the First Anglo-Sikh War  
This brings in more lexicons, those of:  
  
 Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh empire  
 Maharaja Gulab Singh Dogra  
 British East India Company  
  
Come 1947, and the parceling out of the *region* 'Kashmir', and yet more interested parties:  
 India,  
 Pakistan,  
 and China  
along with yet three more lexicons.  
  
So the big question surely is, who, and using whose lexicon, actually named the region?  
Specifically, what is the esteemed Author's grounds for asserting the 'Kashmir' of today, is of today's (i.e. Classical) Sanskrit lexicon?
