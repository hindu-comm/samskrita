Dear list

  

Some of you may be interested in my article on etymology of the word Kashmir.

Unfortunately the diacritics did not pass the copy-editing process. The attached word article is a pre-publication draft with diacritics. The attachment is for your reference only, and for any citations, please cite the article in Swarajya.  

  

Your feedback and comments are welcome, as always.

  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Nityanand
