Who named it?

  

Someone or some people who were born before the earliest documented use of the word ('Kashmeera \> Kaashmeera' ) in the ancient Sanskrit texts.

  

Punjabi is, like any other contemporary north Indian language, a contemporary version of one of the Prakrits (regional dialects of Sanskrit).

  

The word Punjabi applies to the contemporary form, not to its older Prakrit form.

  

The period that you have in mind, the period of composition of 'Vedas , Upanishads and Mahabharata' did not have Punjabi in its present form.

  

So to use the data such as Shah Mir etc. from the tongues much much later to someone or some people born before the earliest documented use of the word ('Kashmeera \> Kaashmeera' ) in the ancient Sanskrit texts,does not help.
