“Place where people go” is my translation of “गच्छन्त्यत्र” by Bhattathiri. कक्षे (कश् + लट् + प्र.पु. + ब.व.) = गच्छन्ति \[जनाः\] अत्र that is the sense. The usage by Bhattathiri is similar to सत्रम् which is by US ४.१७७ गुधृवीपचिवचियमिसदिक्षदिभ्यस्त्र: where Bhattathiri says सीदन्त्युपविशन्त्यत्र जनाः सत्रम् \[“satra is that in which people sit”\].

  

“Experiences pain” is a mistranslation of “कष्टे गच्छति”. Consider Dayandanda Sarasvati on the Sutra who makes it clear that कष्टे is a verbal form: कष्टे गच्छति शास्ति वा असौ कश्मीरः देशभेदो वा. It is not that puzzling, the translator seems to have taken कष्टे in some commentary as a subanta (“in pain”), which it is not given the context, and combined it with गच्छति “goes” to get “experiences pain”.

  

Hope this helps.
