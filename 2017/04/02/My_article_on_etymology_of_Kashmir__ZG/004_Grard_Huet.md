A new edition of the उणादिकोशः was published in 2004 by Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. It listsकश्मीरः as obtained by rule \[4,32\]कशोर्मुट् च.

However, the word is interpreted differently there, asकष्टे गच्छति इति कश्मीरः i.e. "Kashmir isthat which experiences pain".

Thus, even if one adheres to theव्युत्पन्न point of view, your conclusion about uṇādisūtra(s) giving an authoritative unambiguous etymology is to be taken with a grain of salt, since pandits differ in their interpretation...
