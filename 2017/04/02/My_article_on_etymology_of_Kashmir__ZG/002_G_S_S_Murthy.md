Nice article, Nityanandji.

As far as I can recall Valmiki makes no mention of Kashmir, but he speaks of UttaraKuru. From his description of Uttarakuru, it appears to be a beautiful valley. Could it be another name of Kashmir or Is UttaraKuru's location clearly identified geographically?

Regards,

Murthy
