Very nice article. Well-argued. I feel this article should put to rest some of the wilder speculations on the origin of the toponym e.g., that of Wilson, Babur etc.  
  

Still, ' a place to which people go' may not present itself as an arresting final argument to some of us. But we do have other janapada's like anga, vanga, kalinga, mithila etc whose names appear to me to be without etymology.  
  

Regards,
