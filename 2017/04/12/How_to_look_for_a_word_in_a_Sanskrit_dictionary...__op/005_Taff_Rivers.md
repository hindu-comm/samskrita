A certain degree of processing power on your *device* is required to access the **already available information** in such a manner:

 It's only the *books of today,* including those of the lexicon kind, that have page numbers!  
  
 The extant lexicons have an interval of a millennium or two after the origin of the oral scriptures. And even for a given scripture, endless unedifying debate occurs as to which version is the authentic / earliest one.
