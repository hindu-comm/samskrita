Dear Sripada Abhyankar,  

I do not know whether any word index of अष्टाध्यायी is available in print. However, I have generated an electronic word index of not only अष्टाध्यायी but also other texts like काशिका, सिद्धान्तकौमुदी and लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी in our software called गणकाष्टाध्यायी.

If you click the search menu and key-in the word you are searching, the software lists outwithin seconds,all the Sutras wherein the word occurs, It gives the reference numbers and the full text of the Sutras highlighting the word being searched in red colour. A sample page of the search results is attached for your ready reference. The software can be freely downloaded from our website:
