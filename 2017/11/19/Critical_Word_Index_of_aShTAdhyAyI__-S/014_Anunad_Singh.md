It seems to me that 'critical word list' has not been defined, so  
every body is taking it in his own way. Can it be defined (or  
specified). If such a list has to be most useful, what form should it  
have?  
  
First I was thinking that any concordance program could be used to  
find various occurrences of a word. But then felt that due to Sandhi  
and change of form of the word due to other process, it will not be  
sufficient.
