नमस्ते श्रीमन् अजित-कृष्णन्-महोदय !

English translation of the title of the book is mentioned only as "Critical Word Index". Seems to be some great pains-taking job done by the author अवनीन्द्रकुमार-वर्यः

Out of curiosity, I made a screen-shot of a [sample page](http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/word-index-of-panini-s-astadhyayi-with-hindi-commentary-and-astadhyayi-sutra-patha-at-end-NZA697?utm_source=sweetcouch&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=sweetcouch_general) from the book. The screen-shot shows extracting words ते and तेन from different सूत्र-s. Since they are extracted from differentसूत्र-s, their meaning in particular contexts is also explained in this Critical Word Index. This is so also in the Critical Word Index of the भगवद्गीता.

  

Butin this Critical Word Index of अष्टाध्यायी,to understand how the given meaning or explanation is correct, one needs to go to respectiveसूत्र-s.

In their Critical Word Indexof अष्टाध्यायी, पाठक-चित्राव-शास्त्रिणौ have limited their compilation to giving only सूत्रक्रमाङ्क-s.

  

But regarding the doubt rightly expressed by नीलेश-बोडस-वर्यः, I notice thatपाठक-चित्राव-शास्त्रिणौhave listedseparately(1) अण् (प्रत्यय) (2) समासान्तर्गत अण्-(प्रत्यय) पूर्वपदवत्, coded asअण्\*,(3) समासान्तर्गत अण्-(प्रत्यय) उत्तरपदवत्,coded as \*अण्,(4) समासान्तर्गत अण्-(प्रत्यय) मध्यमपदवत्,coded as \*अण्\*and (5) अण् (प्रत्याहार). What a smart job all this !! They labored hard for 12 years and their book was published in 1935.

  

Obliged to Dr. H. N. Bhat for giving link to the PDF of the book.

  

You too अजित-कृष्णन्-महोदय have done great job of compiling nearly 4000 pages of<https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/>
