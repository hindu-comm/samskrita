स्वामीजी !

  

I was very excited by your kind message. So I proceeded to fill in the Registration form, got the ID number, filled that in, only to find that your software is windows-based.

  

I use a Chromebook, which can run only Google spreadsheets, though it can also convert xls-files into google-spreadsheets.

  

There is a spreadsheet file of [अष्टाध्यायी](https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/), (available as linked here) wherein there are पदच्छेद-s of all सूत्र-s. But for preparing a word index therefrom, I think, every पदम् from those पदच्छेद-s has to be separately listed and sorted out.

  

Of course Dr. H. N. Bhat has very graciously provided link to a very comprehensive word index compiled by विद्वांसौ पाठक-चित्राव-महोदयौ (1935-publication). I have been able to download that file. And it gives indexes of not only of अष्टाध्यायी but even its परिशिष्टानि.
