Namaste!

  

You might find<http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/wordindex.php> useful.
(Takes a while to load, please be patient!).

  

Note that, however, it doesn't have semantic knowledge (as of now). That means two things -

  

\(a\) If you search for say "अण्", it will return sutras containingअण् pratyaahar as well asअण् pratyay. There is no way to distinguish between the two.

\(b\) If you search for say"कित्", it will not return the sutras that contain"कितः" / "किति" etc - because it has no knowledge of vibhakti forms.
