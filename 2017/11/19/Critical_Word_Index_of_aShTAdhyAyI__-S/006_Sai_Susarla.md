Since our publication of the ashtadhyayi spreadsheet on [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org), a lot of work has been done, and that page will be updated in December.

  

All sandhi vicchedas have been done. We now have a python library that uses the spreadsheet to extract term definitions, generates pratyaya and other lists, forms mahavakyas. We also wrote a suffix-based vibhakti analyzer just for ashtadhyayi words to match word recurrence by praatipadikam.

  

Next we are adding sutra text interpretation of vidhi and paribhasha sutras.

The code is at

<https://github.com/vedavaapi/ashtadhyayi>

  

Thr code is not yet user-friendly, but works, and is in active development.

  

The latest version of ashtadhyayi spreadsheet is at
