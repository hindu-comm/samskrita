Glad to know that such an index exits in print. Can you send me the link?

  

You have stated that you have prepared the word index up to the Sutra
1.1.20. I do not know what method you are following in preparing the index. If you are doing it manually, it will be very tedious. Instead, it will be easier if you can engage a software engineer who can write a small program for you to prepare the concordance.  You can then prepare the critical edition. I can suggest one software engineer in Bangalore if you want.

  

Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji
