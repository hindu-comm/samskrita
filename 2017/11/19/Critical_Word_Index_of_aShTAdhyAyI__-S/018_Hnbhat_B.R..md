What Critical Words list specification has not been given for Ashtadhyi? Diwanji has explained for the Words of Bhagavadgita. Such an explanation is necessary for Index of Ashtadhyayi. There is quite difference in both texts.

  

First of all there is differences between Sutrapatha popular and Sutrapatha in Kashika and prakriyakaumudi and Prakriyasarvasva, and Sidhantakaumudi.

  

Next the words to be included are the words in Gita verses only,(in 3 recensions) and do not have the words of Anuvritti as in Ashtadhyayi. Are the words in Anuvritti to be included in Index each time or not?

  

Prakriyasarvasva, and Sidhantakaumudi have difference in Sutras than KashikaSutrapatha. What are the recensions of Sutrapatha to be included? Bhagavadgita had threerecensions included explained in the introduction itself.

  

There will be Sautra sand his than popular words and liable to be split differently.

  

All these and more will have to be considered in the beginning itself.

  

All these
