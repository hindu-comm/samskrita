[\[Advaita-l\] Bhashya on Rudram Laghu Nyasa](http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2016-March/040551.html)

  

  

"Late. Brahma Sri Meemamsa Vidhwan Sri E. Balasubrahmanya Sastrigal of

Sanskrit college, Mylapore Chennai, has written a bhasya for Mahanyasa.

  

That covers Laghu Nyasa as well. Don't know whether the text is still

available or not.

  

But not sure of other text which has in detail.

  

If my memory is right even the Sri Anna N Subrahmanya Iyer bhasya of Sri

Rudram published by Ramakrishna Mutt Mylapore also has these bhasya but in

Tamil Script."
