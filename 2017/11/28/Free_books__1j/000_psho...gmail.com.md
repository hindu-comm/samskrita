Hi,

  

The following books are available (for free):

  

\- Mundakopanishad by Gita Press, in Hindi with Sankara's commentary. (Sankara wrote his commentaries in English and so I'm guessing this must be a Hindi translation of Sankara's commentary)

\- ashtAvakragIta (this is a print-out of a pdf file. The verses are in devanagari. Each verse is broken to words and meanings given in English. The whole verse meaning is then given followed by a commentary (all in English))

  

I live in the ***San Francisco bay area**.*

  

If you're interested in these books, please let me know. First come, first served.

  

Because it takes time, effort, and money to send these through mail, please DO NOT ask me to mail them to you. If you are living in the bay area, I can pass these books to you.

  

Best,

  

PS
