Sir, I would like to understand when the words or prefixes सह and विना or their equivalents govern the instrumental case:

you have given the example: रामं विना अयोध्या न शोभते । Why not रामेण विना अयोध्या न शोभते  
The word विना or may be its equivalents, may be used to convey - excepting; 'who else excepting you'; here it is not a simple without.  
कृष्ण: रामेण सह गच्छति। कृष्ण: रामेण विना गच्छति or कृष्ण: रामं विना गच्छति- which is proper?  
In the Venkatesa suprabhata:  
विना वेंकटेशं ननाथो ननाथ: सदा वेंकटेशम् स्मरामि स्मरामि - I think here it is not just without Venkatesa, but 'who else other than Venkatesa'  
Then: अनायासेन मरणं विना दैन्येन जीवनम् देहि मे कृपया कृष्ण - why the instrumental case in अनायासेन - is it because it means effortless or without effort  
आयास रहित or विना आयासं and because of the sense of विना, instrumental case is used; of course the next portion also because of specific use of  
the word 'विना’.

In the light of this, I once again request you to throw light on the use of विना and the appropriate कारक

धन्यवाद:
