At the outset, We convey on behalf of kalāsadan, our best wishes for a Happy Diwali and a Prosperous New Year.  

  We introduce ourselves as one of the pioneer cultural institutions in Mumbai engaged in the promotion of classical art forms since the last six decades. Kalāsadan was established in the year 1964 by late Guru Shri Mani with the objective of preserving and propagating classical art forms of Bharatanatyam & Carnatic music and the classical language of Sanskrit.

  

Our efforts towards carrying forward Guruji's legacy of revival and propagation of Sanskrit through the medium of classical music and dance has culminated in the creation of the Sanskrit ballet, "*Umā-Parinayam*". With its plot drawn from the Siva Purāṇa and the*Kumārasaṃbhava,*the*Umā-Parinayam*, is a blend of poetic verses and melodious songs in Sanskrit,inspired by the great works like Jayadeva's*Gita Govinda*and*Krsnalīlātarangini*of Sri Narayana Tīrtha,choreographed in the Bharatanatyam style of classical dance.

  

Our Artistes would be presenting the same under the auspices of Sri Shanmukhananda Fine Arts and Sangeetha Sabha on18.11.2017.

  

We expect to make the event a congregation of art-lovers and sanskritists and your presence would be a great source of support and strength to us in this humble effort of ours topreservearchiac tradition of operatic Sanskrit plays.

  

Regards,

For Kalasadan,
