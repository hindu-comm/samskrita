Dear All:

  

Many Thanks to

Shri Surendra Nath Mishra, Professor Kurukshetra University ,

Shri Davinder Singh ji, PanjabDigital Library, and

Shankarji Jha , Punjab University,

  

in making it possible retrieval of decades Old Digital Work of PDL that was deferred release because of metadata expertise.

  

190 Sharada and Devanagari Manuscripts are now viewable at:

  

<https://archive.org/details/@kurukshetra_university>

  

Lists of Individual Items can be seen divided by Script/Language:

This Manuscript

  

<https://archive.org/details/MN000610DiverseTextsIncludingBhaktiRatnavaliLakshmiStotraGopalStotraAndUnIdentif>

  

has some strange script used in Pg 24-28.

  

If someone can shed some light on it will be interesting to know what script samples we have found. Mahajani/Lehenda is what I have been thinking but there aren't enough samples online to confirm the conjecture.

  

56 Gurumukhi Texts and 28 Perseo Arabic Texts will be uploaded soon once I find experts to identify text titles.

  

Thanks and regards,
