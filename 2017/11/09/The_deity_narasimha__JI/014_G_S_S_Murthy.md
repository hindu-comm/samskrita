It is indeed a mystery to me why Vishnupurana does not support Narasimha legend. The legend of Prahlada is dealt with in Chapter 20 (Gorakhpur edition of VP). There the story is that Prahlada offers his prayers to Vishnu and Vishnu appears and grants boons to Prahlada. Prahlada asks for forgiving the faults of his father Hiranyakasipu. Vishnu disappears and Prahlada goes to his father, who expresses his grief for hurting his son Prahlada. The form of Narasimha and Narasimha appearing from a pillar suddenly and killing of Hiranyakasipu are missing.
