It is totally unfair to bring in Ramayana - here ayana means way/path.  
  
"ayatana" for resting place ( देवायतनं, मठायतनं ) is far more established.  
  
For "ayana" Apte's dictionay says "A place, site, abode, place of resort; ता यदस्यायनं पूर्वं Ms. 1. 10 (occurring in the derivation of the word नारायण)"  
  
If this meaning is given to "ayana" ONLY to explain "Narayana" - it means nothing.
