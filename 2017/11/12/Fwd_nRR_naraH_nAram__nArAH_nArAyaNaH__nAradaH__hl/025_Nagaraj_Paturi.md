I am not unaware of the 'Dravidian' words in Rigveda.

  

When we use expressions such as 'satisfactory etymology' we should be able to show why the Dravidian etymology is (more) convincing and satisfactory.

  

Suniti Kumar Chatterjee or any other such linguist , however respectable they are (they ARE for me). We should be aware that these early linguists of India, like many modern intellectuals, were swayed by the excitement of the enlightenment age, that was born of the proving the traditionally established ideas wrong.

  

At that stage, the only answer to all the avyutpanna Sanskrit words was 'Dravidian' origin.

  

If naaraayaNa is accepted as avyutpanna from Sanskrit grammar, that does not and should not immediately imply that it is Dravidian in origin. Dravidian origin theory should satisfy those criteria which Sanskrit origin is considered not to have satisfied.
