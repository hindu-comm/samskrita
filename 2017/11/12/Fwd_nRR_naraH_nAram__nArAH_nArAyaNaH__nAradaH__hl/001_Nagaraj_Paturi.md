Interesting derivations!

  

I wrote a lyric for my Prahladarahasyam yakshagana written for a proscenium theatre presentation with an ecological interpretation of the Prahlada story.

  

The lyric is sung by Narada as a continuous theme-interpreting bhajan-interlude between episodes.

  

Its pallavi =refrain in Telugu when translated into English reads as:

  

Oh Narayana! among the multiple (polysemous) meanings of your name,

  

the meaning of 'human' is the most sublime and adorable!

  

(నారాయణ! నీ నానార్థములలొ

  

మానవార్థమే మహనీయమయా! )

  

It is a different matter that through pun, there are other meanings too built into these lines.

  

Your derivation of naaraayaNa from nara , I found coincidental from this point of view.
