Many evidences can be shown to establish that the word Narayana has the syllables naa , raa, ya, and N/Na in north Indian use of it too. Narain is not the all pervading way that word is used. Pronouncing ajanta words as halant is frequently found in Hindi and other north Indian languages. That makes naaraayaNa as naaraayaN there. Just as raama turns out to be raam. The ya , when gets a halanta form turns into y and may give rise to pronunciation such as naaraaiN or naaraain among certain sections of language users. But those among north Indians who are aware of the prevalence of the word in Sanskrit sources know it is naaraayaNa only.
