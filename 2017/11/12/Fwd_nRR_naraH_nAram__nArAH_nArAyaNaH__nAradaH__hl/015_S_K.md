sarcasm aside -  None other than Suniti Kumar chatterjee has said Classical Sanksrit is more like a Dravidian language than Indo-european. It is well-known that there are several hundred Dravidian words in rig Veda, the retroflex sounds are considered by many to have come from Dravidian. "narayana" doesn't sound like sanskrit but clearly sounds like dravidian. A scholar called L.B. Keny says "narayana" is Dravidian. to modern day hindi speakers, it has chaned to "narain".
