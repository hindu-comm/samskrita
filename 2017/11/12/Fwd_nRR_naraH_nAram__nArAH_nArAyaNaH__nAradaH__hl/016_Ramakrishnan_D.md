"Narayana" is quite a sanskrit word. In South India, it is very common to name the children, like Satyanarayanan, Harinaraynan, Venkat Narayanan, Siva narayana etc since long long ago. The name 'Narayana' is used all over India. It does not at all

sound dravidian. Let us not have any politics in learning Samskritam.
