I pity all arguments which tend to create a divide between शैवम् and वैष्णवम् or vie to prove superiority of one school of thought over the other. 

  

By its title itself, if the blog "narayanastra" is itself conceived to suggest superiority of नारायणास्त्र over पाशुपतास्त्र,that is quite some immaturity, if not meanness of thought.

  

Basic requirement of spirituality is, that all द्वन्द्व-s should get nullified. If that is so, why promote any द्वन्द्व ?

  

In my etymological study, I came to realize that नारायणः as a बहुव्रीहि-type of compound word \[नारस्य अयनं यस्मात् सः (बहुव्रीहिः)\] has some shade of being an adjective.

  

As a departure from that, the article at the referenced blog treats नारायणः as a proper noun and then dwells on शैवम् and वैष्णवम्. Such approaches are no way going to help concordance among all Hindus. I am not concerned with or worried about that also. I am worried about immaturity propagating.
