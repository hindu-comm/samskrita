The "scholarly opinion" provided in skpflex1's link claims the following:  

  
Claim: "water in Sanskrit is aapa. Neera or Neeru is a common word to all Dravidian languages."  

Fact: Water in Sanskrit has at least 25+ words, which includes ap (aapa), neeram, jalam, etc.  

From Amara:  

    ## Water (27), watery (2)  ##
    (1\.10\.522)  ApaH strI bhUmni vArvAri salilaM kamalaM jalam
    (1\.10\.523)  payaH kIlAlamamR^itaM jIvanaM bhuvanaM vanam
    (1\.10\.524)  kabandhamudakaM pAthaH puShkaraM sarvatomukham
    (1\.10\.525)  ambho.arNastoyapAnIyanIrakShIrAmbushambaram
    (1\.10\.526)  meghapuShpaM ghanarasastriShu dve Apyamammayam

  
  

Claim: "Again, ayana is described as abode. But the Sanskrit word for abode is ayatana."  

Fact: A dictionary lookup gives several meanings for ayana including way and place / refuge.  
  

Then the "scholarly" opinion goes right off the bend. It splits "ayan" into "aya" and "an" and ascribes the following meaning:  

Claim: "In Dravidian languages, the meaning of 'aya' is 'to lie' ..., while 'an' is a male personal termination."  

Fact: This is plainly ridiculous.  
  

If this "scholarly" understanding is to be believed, then the word Ramayana is Dravidian as well. According to the above logic, Ramayana = Rama + aya + an.  
  

So are the words gamana, shravaNa, manana and all such lyuT-ending words. Then I suppose the "scholarly opinion" would claim that lyuT-pratyaya-endings were borrowed into Sanskrit from Dravidian languages. Please provide evidence of such claims.  

  

And SK, let me reiterate a point that another poster has made. The use of quotation marks are to show that I am quoting words/phrases. For example, "scholarly opinion" is a phrase from your previous email.
