"neera" is a samskrit word only. There are no words like 'dravidian'.

Neerajam, neerajadalanetri, naarada, naranaaraayana, narasimha, nrisimha, niranjana, neerasa etc, so many innumerable words are there

in Samskrit literature. So we do not find any difference in words like aryan or dravidian in the sacred language, Samskritam.
