The correct rendering is

  

समानी व आकूति: समाना हृदयानि व: ।

समानमस्तु वो मनो यथा व: सुसहासति ।। Rigveda 10.191.4

  

It has been translated by Ralph TH Griffith as

  

One and the same be your resolve, and be your minds of one accord.

United be the thoughts of all that all may happily agree.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
