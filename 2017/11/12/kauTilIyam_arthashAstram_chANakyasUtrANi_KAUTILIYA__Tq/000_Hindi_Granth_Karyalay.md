Canakya won lasting fame as the mentor of Emperor Candragupta Maurya. He was the chief advisor to both Candragupta and his son Bimbisara.

  

Also known as Vishnugupta and Kautilya, Canakya was a teacher, philosopher, economist and jurist.

  

His Arthashastra offers timeless advice on diverse themes such as the nature of government, law, civil and criminal court systems, ethics, economics, markets and trade, the methods for screening ministers, diplomacy, theories on war, nature of peace, and the duties and obligations of a king.

  

It incorporates Hindu philosophy, includes ancient economic and cultural details on agriculture, mineralogy, mining and metals, animal husbandry, medicine, forests and wildlife.

  

It explores issues of social welfare and the collective ethics that hold a society together. It advises the king that in times of war, famine, epidemic and natural disaster, he should initiate public projects such as creating irrigation waterways and building forts around major strategic holdings and towns and exempt taxes on those affected.

  

The Kautiliya Arthashastra is a seminal work that has exerted great influence on Indian thought. The Canakya Niti is another excellent work on statecraft and ethics.

  

We are proud to distribute this fine Hindi translation of both texts, the Kautiliya Arthashastra as well as the Canakya Sutra. This translation by Pandeya Ramateja Shastri was first published several decades ago by Pandit Pustakalaya, Varanasi. It has been freshly reprinted and is now available at our bookstore and through mail order.
