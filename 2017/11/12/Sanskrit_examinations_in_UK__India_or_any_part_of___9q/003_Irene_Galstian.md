Dear Smita,

  

Your intention is probably good, but the setup sounds quite bureaucratic.

  

See how Narasinga Rao teaches Sanskrit on YouTube, note how little he needs to make a huge difference. He is just one person on a planet of several billion, but see how much he got done (and is still doing).

  

Today, it's no longer about organisations. It's about individuals reaching within themselves and taking action.

  

Kind regards,

Irene
