Dear All,

  

I have received response and about teaching Sanskrit in informal way.

We do have many Good sources of learning but it's ulimately following the Gurukul model.

  

It's informal:

1\) Let it have a streamlined and dedicated level of clearance.

2\) Environment is created to have Shastrarth

3\) Present, education structure is parallely challenged
