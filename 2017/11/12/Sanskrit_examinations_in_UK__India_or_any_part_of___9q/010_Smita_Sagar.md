Thank you Chandra Shekhar Garu, Ramakrishnan Garu and DR Y N RAO Garu for the support.  

An update, I have received response from education wing of High Commission London acknowledging the requirement. Mail snapshot attached for your reference.

  

What I have experienced is that all the offices had been mailed multiple times but I have received response only upon sending the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Grievance reference no.**PMOPG/E/2017/0603115**

  

**Regards**

**Smita**
