Hi Irene,

  

I agree with your view point, if one wishes to learn will definitely find the way.

I am undergoing the same syllabus which Sir teaches.

Honestly, I too did not have idea on Sanskrit untill I found some spare time myself.

For e.g. in Mumbai there are many schools which does not even introduce it. No one will have a grain of idea how deep the knowledge system is or how well connected it is with Science, Maths, Dance, Music etc.



By choosing one field you are ignoring the other, in current world no one has spare time left after 8th grade, one has to start for 9th and 10th grade examinations to choose career and loose out on knowledge which can be deployed parallely.

  

I hope, my concern is understood well.

  

I thank all the initiatives taken by Shaale, Advaita Academy, Prof in IIT & IIM continuing to give lectures & others.

  

Exams are required for continuing learning & application.

  

Regards  
Smita
