Dear Ramana Murthy mahodaya !

Padmasanam is good for meditation and it is easy to sit long time.

Siddhi is in meditation & not in any asan. For meditation you have to concentrate on any mantra or any form of a God or a light (jyoti).

Normally some mantra we always choose. if you fix your mind on mantra, by practicing regularly and at a particular time or times, you will lose your attention on the body and that relieves pain in the body.

That leads to siddhi of any thing. That's my idea.
