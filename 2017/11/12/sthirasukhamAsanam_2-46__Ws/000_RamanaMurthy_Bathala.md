Dear sir,

I have few queries regarding asana siddhi.

  

While doing meditation, I get unbearable pain in the legs, joints, knees and back. I was advised sit cross legged. My whole mind was concentrated on the pain.

Patanjali says स्थिरसुखमासनम् ॥२-४६॥

Whether we should sit cross legged or sit on chair is not mentioned. Patanjali has not given how to sit comfortable in a posture.

  

I heard Asana Siddhi.

1)  1.How much time one should sit in any asana so that he is said to be mastered Asana Siddhi? Does any book mentionedthe time duration.

2) 2. Is there any book exclusively deals in how to practiceto gain Asana siddhi.

  

From the childhood it self, we are accustomed to sit on benchesin the schools. So when grown-up, we are finding difficult to sit on the floor with crossed-legs during meditation. In good old days of schooling, students were sittiong on the floor.

  

Some people take it liberty and say that it does not matter whether one sits on the floor or on the chair. Important thing is to keep the back and neck in straight line.

  

If any one has mastered Asana Siddhi, please guide me.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
