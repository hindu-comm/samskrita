Sunder,  
  
 Yes that helps.  
  
It is English, but like most of these earlier texts the English is somewhat laboured.  
Viz. ***Atha, as 'sequence***'.  
  
I can only come to a conclusion as to what that means after much thinking!  
Perhaps the adverb '**Now**' - at the present time?  
As it (**now**) comes after what has gone before, and before what is yet to come!  
  
And I still need to find *adhi-kāra-artha*, etc.  
  
It is looking like I need to get hold of Kumārila's text, and hope that it is easier for me to read!  
  
Regards,  
  
Taff
