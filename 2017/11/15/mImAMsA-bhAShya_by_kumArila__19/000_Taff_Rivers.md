All,  
  
Towards the understanding of the sūtra style of text.  
  
I read that '*There are six kinds of sūtra according to the Mīmāṃsā*'  
  
  the definition (saṃ-jñā),  
 the key to interpretation (pari-bhāṣā),  
 the statement of a general rule (vidhi),  
 the restrictive rule (niyama),  
 an original statement (adhī-kāra),  
 an analogical application (ati-deśa).  
  
and also that 'the word atha may'  
  
 introduce a topic (adhi-kāra-artha),  
 or give the purport (pra-stāva-artha),  
 or state the subject-matter of the discussion {ā-rambha-artha).  
  
I have not been able to locate an actual source (the śloka-vārttika), or an extraction thereof, in a format that makes for easy reading and note taking.  
  
I would appreciate any information that anyone may have on this topic - not lexical, but explanatory, please.  
  
Thanks in advance,  
  
 Taff
