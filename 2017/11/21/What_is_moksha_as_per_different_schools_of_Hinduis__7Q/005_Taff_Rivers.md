KN,  
  
**Mokṣa** is just a word.  
 And a *tamas* one, at that.  
 As are all definitions, no matter how many.  
  
In its *rajas* incarnation, where it known as Om, it is be evoked though ***praṇava***.  
Given its nature, it can be realized only by directly experience thru the instrumental agency of the praṇava.  
  
That experience is unique, but universally the same to all who experience it.  
It too, has many names...  
  
It is beyond words, but then so are many experiences of the mind, love hate... that have to be experienced, before one can be certain that those things so often spoken of by poets and the like, do actually exist for real.  
  
That unique experience is reported of by many - I have experienced it myself.  
  
As to How that *mokṣa* experience is actually obtained, very little is said.  
  
All it really requires is a mind, and we all have one of them - and an effort of will - and favourable circumstances.  
  
But where are the detailed reports?  
What were the background circumstances of the successful outcomes? times, place, ages, magic mushrooms...  
  
Thanks in advance,  
  
Taff,  
  
R & D person.
