Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Sri. Nrusimha Jayanti** falls on **Tuesday (9/May/2017)**, I am delighted to attach a rare 8-stanza (**Ashtakam**) taken from **Nrusimha Puranam** and **Chapter 8** which delineates the story of **Sage Markandeya**.

  

As instructed by **Vag**, **Sage Markandeya** completed bathing in all holy places but still could not get the divine vision of **Lord Narayana**. Feeling dejected, he prayed to **Vag** once again who gave this hymn mentioning that this hymn gave the benefit of bathing in allholy places. **Sage Markandeya** then prayed with this hymn with full deviton followed by his own prayer (which appear in prose form at the end). Pleased with this, **Lord Narayna** bestowed both long life and divine vision of his cosmic form.

  

Actually there is yet another hymn by **Sage Markandeya** in the preceding chapter (which I shared a few years ago) and this is a continuation of the same.

  

May We Pray To **Lord Nrusimha** on **Nrusimha Jayanti** day with this rare hymn and beget the benefit of bathing in all holy places.
