\[Moderator's note\]  
  
At this point, the discussion on this thread is way too scattered to be useful. Please continue this discussion off-the-list. If you have something more concrete, then feel free to write in the group.  
  

While Abhyankarji's goal of a synthesized conclusion from a study of the three texts is laudable, could you perhaps break it down for a discussion? Otherwise it is too abstract a wish at this point.
