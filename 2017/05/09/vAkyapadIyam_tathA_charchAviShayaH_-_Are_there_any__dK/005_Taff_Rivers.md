SL,  
  
 Is the ***sphoṭa*** your subject?  
  
Confining your research to narrow regions of the world and its past epochs gives a false sense of reality.  
  
For example,See Bhartṛhari's Philosophy of Language  
 Journal of the American Oriental Society  
 Vol. 119, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1999), pp. 88-125  
  
Darwin has an alternative view on the origin of ***sphoṭa*** when 'bursting' is interpreted as 'emergence'.  
  
Compare and contrast for a greater understanding of the nature of thing aka the meaning of life (:-).  
  
Anyway, the mental associations that arise in my mind when 'noun' sounds, do not seem to have the same associations as your 'noun' sounds do.  
  
  
Taff,  
  
 If all my sentences above, are false, am I telling the truth?
