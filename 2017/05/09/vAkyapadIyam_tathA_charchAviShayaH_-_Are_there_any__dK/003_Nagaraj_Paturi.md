1\. What a word is etymologically and what is its role in a sentence is not the issue dealt in vAkyapadIyam. That is not the reson why is called vAkyapadIyam.

  

2\. As per the theory presented in vAkyapadIyam, words do not have an independent existence. dividing a sentence into words and words into their constituent units such as the root/the stem, prefix, suffix etc. is done by the grammarian for the purpose of analysis. vAkya is important because people speak in vAkya-s not in words. Words are important because people think there are words. व्यवहारः पदाश्रयः -वा.प. aShTAdhyAyI generates words not sentences. But the nature of words is to contribute to a unified meaning called sentence-meaning. That is the meaning (at least one of the meanings of समर्थः पदविधिः 2.2.2. Since the book deals with the actually real वाक्य and analytically real पद , it is called वाक्यपदीयम् .

  

3\. Another reason for its being called vAkyapadIyam is the significance for the two kANDa-s vAkyakANDa and padakANDa. The book is also called as trikANDi. The beauty is that the first chapter is named after the ultimately real , i.e., Brahman (here, S'abdabrahman) and the second , after the theoretically real , i.e., vAkya and the third, after the pragmatically real , i.e. pada.

  

3.You know the following : सुप्तिङंतम् पदम् । नाम and आख्यात are the only two categories of words as per Sanskrit grammarians. Adjective is only a functional role of a नाम. In सुंदरी बाला , both the words are nouns only. Both can be used as independent nouns in a sentence without any change in their form.

  

4\. In vAkyapadIyam, the adjectival meaning of a noun is dealt in guNasamuddEs'ya and the nominal meaning of noun is dealt in dravyasamuddEs'ya, both as chapters of padakANDa.
