So, what a word is etymologically and what the role of the word is in a sentence are two different things. Possibly one should be finding gooddiscussion on the role of a word in a sentence in वाक्यपदीयम् of भर्तृहरिः. That could be the logic of its title having the wordवाक्य notवाक्. It comes to mind that by this viewpoint, study of वाक्यपदीयम् of भर्तृहरिः has its own significance. Probably such significance of वाक्यपदीयम् has notbeen brought out at all. There is so much talk of study of अष्टाध्यायी, कौमुदीetc., that study ofवाक्यपदीयम् hardly ever gets any mention.  

अपि साध्विदम् ?
