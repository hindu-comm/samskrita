Dear Mr. Taff Rivers !

  

I am impressed by your urge "to get to the root of the matter". It seems that in so doing, you would like to derive somesynthesized conclusion from a comprehensive study of

1.  यास्काचार्याणाम् निरुक्तम्
2.  मुनित्रयाणां (पाणिनिः, वररुचिः, पतञ्जलिश्च) व्याकरणम्
3.  भर्तृहरेः वाक्यपदीयम्

It comes to mind that basically all these should beconsidered as complimentary to each other.

  

But with so many great works involved, there will be the challenge to keep focus on "*the role of a word in a sentence*".

  

BTW I happened to be browsing through "[Indian Semantic Analysis: The Nirvacana Tradition](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z0_JQXYkG7IC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=RV+10.86.1&source=bl&ots=GUUwHwFs4p&sig=9mJ0Pj0wXann6W3OUs8dH3JUEX8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90YrDvezTAhWHt48KHXlCBrAQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=RV%2010.86.1&f=false)[By Eivind Kahrs](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z0_JQXYkG7IC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=RV+10.86.1&source=bl&ots=GUUwHwFs4p&sig=9mJ0Pj0wXann6W3OUs8dH3JUEX8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90YrDvezTAhWHt48KHXlCBrAQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=RV%2010.86.1&f=false)" Some interesting reading !
