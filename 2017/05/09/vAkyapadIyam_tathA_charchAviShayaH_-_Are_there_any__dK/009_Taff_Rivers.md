Gentlemen,  
  
*Possibly one should be finding good discussion on the role of a word in a sentence. iti SL.*  
  
  
 I'm trying to get to the root of the matter, etymologically speaking (:-).  
 As regards Sanskrit, I have yet to come across a topic that has *not* been discussed and extensively so, over the centuries.  
  
 So, **Nirukta** (*per **Yāska***) or **Vyākaraṇa**?  
  
Viz.  
  
 The study of **Nirukta** has been closely related to the ancillary Vedic science of **Vyākaraṇa**, but they have a different focus.  
  
 **Vyākaraṇa** deals with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, while **Nirukta** focuses on linguistic analysis  
 to help establish *the proper meaning of the words, given the context they are used in*.?  
  
 Thank you,  
  
 Taff
