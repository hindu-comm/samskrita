Dear sirs,

  

by the way,

  

I definitely know that, for example, in ancient Greek grammars there are neither nouns nor adjectives. And in medieval grammars also they are not exist. But only "names".

  

And moreover, even in the first Russian grammar of Maletiy Smotritsky - ca. 1600, they also do not exist, only "names".

  

It is also obvious that modern grammar significantly changes the meaning of the ancient text, when it treats some word as a noun or as an adjective, and not as a "name". Modern grammars are the result of the work of Descartes, Newton, Kant's thought, when a single entity is divided into an object, or a thing, and a subject, or a representation. Adjective is automatically understood as an element of our consciousness. Red for me can be green for you, and there is no (in modern knowledge) ways to make sure both reds are the same. And "red" in modern grammar is adjective.

  

Therefore, the ancient text should be read, having in hand and in a mind an only ancient grammar. And ancient set of the notions, and ancient way of working with these notions. Otherwise, an anachronism, a crude mistake, is inevitable.
