Dear Mr. Taff Rivers,

  

No, स्फोटः is not my subject. The चर्चाविषयः is simple. It focuses on derivation and etymology of words and their use or role in a sentence. When used in a sentence, it seems what is विशेषणम् byetymology becomes नाम and/or vice versa.

  

Though I have not studied वाक्यपदीयम्, it came to mind that thisवाक्यपदीयम् must be dealing in this aspect of the language. Dr. Paturi is explaining it beautifully. I am thankful to him.
