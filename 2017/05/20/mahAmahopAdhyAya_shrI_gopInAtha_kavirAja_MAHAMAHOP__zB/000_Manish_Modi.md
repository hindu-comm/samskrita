Gopinath Kaviraj: Scholar Extraordinaire

Pt Gopinath Kaviraj was a [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)-Tantra scholar, Indologist, [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) and spiritual seeker. Born into a family of scholars in Undivided Bengal, he spent most of his life in Varanasi where he worked as the Principal of the Sampurnananda Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya. He also served as the editor of the Sarasvati Bhavan Granthamala (Sarasvati Bhavan Texts).

  

Gopinath Kaviraj was the direct disciple of Svami Vishuddhananda Paramahamsa. Being more interested in research and personal spiritual growth, he retired from his position as the Principal and pursued both his sadhana and scholarly research on Tantra. He also started looking after his Guru's ashram in Varanasi. In his later years, he devoted himself to the study of [Kashmir Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Shaivism). He became an ardent devotee of the mystic Ma Anandamayi.
