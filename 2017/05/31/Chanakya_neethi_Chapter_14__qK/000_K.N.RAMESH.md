### *Chanakya NitiChapter Fourteen*

*।।चाणक्यनीतिशास्त्र।।*



*आत्मापराधवृक्षस्यफलान्येतानिदेहिनाम्।*

*दारिद्र्यदुःखरोगाणिबन्धनव्यसनानिच।।*



*Poverty, disease, sorrow, imprisonment and other evils are the fruits borne by the tree of one's own sins. 1.*



*पुनर्वित्तंपुनर्मित्रंपुनर्भार्यापुनर्महि।*

*एतत्सर्वंपुनर्लभ्यंनशरीरंपुनःपुनः।।*



*Wealth, a friend, a wife, and a kingdom may be regained; but this body when lost may never be acquired again. 2.*



*बहूनांचैवसत्त्वानांसमवायोरिपुञ्जयः।*

*वर्षाधाराधरोमेघस्तृणैरपिनिर्वायते।।*



*The enemy can be overcome by the union of large numbers, just as grass through its collectiveness wards off erosion caused by heavyrainfall. 3.*



*जलेतैलंखलेगुह्यंपात्रेदानंमनागपि।*

*प्राज्ञेशास्त्रंस्वयंयातिविस्तारंवस्तुशक्तितः।।*



*Oil on water, a secret communicated to a base man, a gift given to a worthy receiver, and scriptural instruction given to an intelligent man spread out by virtue of their nature. 4.*



*धर्माख्यानेश्मशानेचरोगिणांयामतिर्भवेत्।*

*सासर्वदैवतिष्ठेच्चेत्कोनमुच्येतबन्धनात्।।*



*If men should always retain the state of mind they experience when hearing religious instruction, when present at a crematorium ground, and when in sickness -- then who could not attain liberation. 5.*



*उत्पन्नपश्चात्तापस्यबुद्धिर्भवतियादृशी।*

*तादृशीयदिपूर्वंस्यात्कस्यनस्यान्महोदयः।।*



*If a man should feel before, as he feels after, repentance -- then who would not attain perfection? 6.*



*दानेतपसेशौर्येवाविज्ञानेविनयेनये।*

*विस्मयोनहिकर्तव्योबहुरत्नावसुंधरा।।*

*  
We should not feel pride in our charity, austerity, valour, scriptural knowledge, modesty and morality because the world is full of the rarest gems. 7.*

*दूरस्थोऽपिनदूरस्थोयोयस्यमनसिस्थितः।*

*योयस्यह्रदयेनास्तिसमिपस्थोऽपिदूरतः।।*

*  
He who lives in our mind is near though he may actually be far away; but he who is not in our heart is far though he may really be nearby. 8.*

*यस्माच्चप्रियमिच्छेत्तुतस्यब्रूयात्सदाप्रियम्।*

*व्याधोमृगवधंकर्तुंगीतंगायतिसुस्वरम्।।*

*  
We should always speak what would please the man of whom we expect a favour, like the hunter who sings sweetly when he desires to shoot a deer. 9.*

*अत्यासन्नाविनाशायदुरस्थानफलप्रदा।*

*सेव्यतांमध्यभावेनराजावन्हिर्गुरूःस्त्रियः।।*

*  
It is ruinous to be familiar with the king, fire, the religious preceptor, and a woman. To be altogether indifferent of them is to be deprived of the opportunity to benefit ourselves, hence our association with them must be from a safe distance. 10.*

*अग्निरापःस्त्रियोमूर्खाःसर्पाराजकुलानिच।*

*नित्यंयत्नेनसेव्यानिसद्यःप्राणहराणिषट्।।*

*  
We should always deal cautiously with fire, water, women, foolish people, serpents, and members of a royal family; for they may, when the occasion presents itself, at once bring about our death. 11.*

*सजीवतिगुणायस्ययस्यधर्मःसजीवति।*

*गुणधर्मनिहीनस्यजीवितंनिष्प्रयोजनम्।।*

*  
He should be considered to be living who is virtuous and pious, but the life of a man who is destitute of religion and virtues is void of any blessing. 12.*

*यदिच्छसिवशीकर्तुंजगदेकेनकर्मणा।*

*पुरापञ्चदशास्येभ्योगांचरन्तिनिवारय।।*

*  
If you wish to gain control of the world by the performance of a single deed, then keep the following fifteen, which are prone to wander here and there, from getting the upper hand of you: the five sense objects (objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch); the five sense organs (ears, eyes, nose, tongue and skin) and organs of activity (hands, legs, mouth, genitals and anus). 13.*

*प्रस्तावसदृशंवाक्यंप्रभावसदृशंप्रियम्।*

*आत्मशक्तिसमंकोपंयोजानातिसपण्डितः।।*

*  
He is a pandit (man of knowledge) who speaks what is suitable to the occasion, who renders loving service according to his ability, and who knows the limits of his anger. 14.*

*एकएवपदार्थस्तुत्रिधाभवतिवीक्षितः।*

*कुणपंकामिनीमांसंयोगिभिःकामिभिःश्र्वभिः।।*

*  
One single object (a woman) appears in three different ways to different kinds of men: To the man who practices austerity woman appears as a corpse. To the sensual man she appears as a woman, and to the dogs as a lump of flesh. 15.*

*सुसिद्धमौषधंधर्मंगृहच्छिद्रंचमैथुनम्।*

*कुभक्तंकुश्रुतंचैवमतिमान्नप्रकाशयेत्।।*

*  
A wise man should not disclose following things : 1. the formula of a medicine which he has well prepared; 2. an act of charity which he has performed; 3. domestic conflicts; 4. private affairs with his wife; 5. poorly prepared food he may have been given; 6. slang he may have heard. 16.*

*तावन्मौनेननीयंन्तेकोकिलेश्र्चैववासराः।*

*यात्सर्वजनानन्ददायिनीवाक्प्रवर्तते।।*

*  
The cuckoos remain silent for a long time (for several seasons) until they are able to sing sweetly (in the Spring ) so as to give joy to all. 17.*

*धर्मंधनंचधान्यंचगुरोर्वचनमौषधम्।*

*सुगृहीतंचकर्तव्यमन्यथातुनजीवति।।*

*  
We should secure and keep the following: the blessings of meritorious deeds, wealth, grain, the words of the spiritual master, and rare medicines. Otherwise life becomes impossible. 18.*

*त्यजदुर्जनसंसर्गंभजसाधुसमागमम्।*

*कुरुपुण्यमहोरात्रंस्मरनित्यमनित्यतः।।*

*Avoid wicked company and associate with saintly persons. Acquire virtue day and night, and always meditate on that which is eternal forgetting that which is temporary. 19.*
