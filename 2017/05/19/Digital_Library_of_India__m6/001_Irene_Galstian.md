Dear Mr Kolhatkar,

  

I don't know how long the upgrades will take, but the library has a mirror on [archive.org](http://archive.org). While you are waiting for the main site to come back online, please consider searching the mirror. The document you are after may well be there.

  

Kind regards,

Irene
