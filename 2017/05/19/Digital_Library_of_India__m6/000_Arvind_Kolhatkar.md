Dear Group,

  

For the last few days the DLI website has been showing the following message:

> > 
> > > > # "Access to all the DLI books will not be available until the upgrades are complete. " > > > > 

  

There is no indication as to what the nature of the upgrade is and, more importantly, how long it is going to take. After several years of unsatisfactory performance, we were happy that DLI had started working reasonably well and pdf scans were easy to download, provided you were lucky to spot a book you needed.  (Poor indexing and transliteration, affecting the quality of the search function, obviously done by some clerical staff who have no idea what they are dealing with, is another complaint of long standing.)

  

Does anyone know how long the upgrading will take? 

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
