As mentioned in my earlier posting ''The First 'Written' Zero in the World" of March 15, I had recently visited the Angkor Wat and surrounding Hindu archaeological sites in Cambodia. During that visit I also visited the National Museum in Phnom Penh.

  

I took several photographs of objects and sculptures in stone in the Museum. One of them was labelled as a 'Brahmanic Marker', which I attach herewith. No explanation is available as to what this stone marker marks but it could be a stone to mark the boundary of a city.
Most of the surface of the marker has several figures carved on it in neat rows. These could be the guardian gods or spirits or ancestors.
The top has a representation of Vishnu, recumbent upon the serpent Ananta, with Laxmi pressing his legs and a lotus with Brahmadeva in it rising out of his navel.

  

(This recumbent vishnu is a popular theme in those temples and are seen everywhere. I attach a photograph of showing a similar image from 'the river of a thousand lingas' about 35 km to the north of the town of Siem Reap, the hub for Angkor Wat ruins. Another popular theme is the 'Samudramanthana'. The Angkor Wat temple has huge panels depicting this scene. Bridges built over moats that surround temples have balustrades on both sides showings gods and demons holding the snake in their hands.
I show a couple of pictures of such balustrades. The heads of the figures have been vandalized long ago by trophy seekers.)
