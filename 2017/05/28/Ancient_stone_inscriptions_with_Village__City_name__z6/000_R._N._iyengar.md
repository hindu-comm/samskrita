Friends,

I am looking for information on ‘sign posts or name stones’ that were inscribed with the local village or city name in Brahmi, Karoshthi, Sharada,Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or any other known ancient script. For the town of Dholavira there is a plaque at the northern gate which looks like a name board, but the script (Indus) has not been deciphered.

Available literature hints at the existence of such artifacts but I am searching for hard physical evidence. As is known there are ancient inscriptions on stone and copper plates in thousands that mention charity deeds and names of agraharas, settlements and towns. But I am looking for isolated stand alone stones with names or numbers ! To make the query still more pointed, is there evidence for names Pataliputra/Kusumapura, Takshashila, Ayodhya, Avanti, Ujjayini,
Dvaraka, Amaravati, Kanchi, Banavasi, Sthaneshwar, ... (or any other place) being shown in relief at the gateways or nearby locations. I would be grateful for information on primary references, even if they are in Indian or foreign museums, or just as estampage.

  

with regards
