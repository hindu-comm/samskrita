RN Iyengar,  
  
  
[What kind of 'numbers' are you interested in? Distances, populations?, most would appear to relate to dreaded taxation. As to epigraphy of place names, things have been narrowed down for you to only 100,000 or so.](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Epigraphy "Epigraphy")  
  
 "An estimated 100,000 inscriptions have now (in 2014) been found, and many of these have been cataloged *and translated*."

Hope this helps,
