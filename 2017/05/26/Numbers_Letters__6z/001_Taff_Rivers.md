Rama,  
  
 It is matter of substituting a spoken letter for a number,*for greater ease in verification*.  
  
An English example.  
 'ay  = 1  
 Bee  = 2  
 Cee = 3  
 . . .  
 Jay = 0  
  
However, Sanskrit embroiders things a bit:  
  
I quote  
 'The very fact that *the alphabetical code* (as used by them for this purpose is in the natural order and can be immediately interpreted, is clear proof that the code language was resorted not for concealment but *for greater ease in verification* etc.,"  
  
But I would be inclined to disagree that it makes for g*reater ease in verification*!
