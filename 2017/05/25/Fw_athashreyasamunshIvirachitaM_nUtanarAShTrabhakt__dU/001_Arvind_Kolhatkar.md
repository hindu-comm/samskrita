It is a good attempt but the terms 'fatherland' and 'motherland' have become a part of the national vocabulary in many countries. India is generally perceived asभारतमाता, as in the popular sloganभारतमाता की जय. In pictorial representations of India, e.g. in Calendar Art, India is shown as a देवी, wielding a sword. VD Savarkar, in defining the word 'Hindu', called India asपितृभू. Both of these senses are missing in this song.

  

In this new song, India has been assigned the neutral gender. In Indian vernaculars,भारत is a masculine gender word. Giving it the third gender may jar with many conventional sensitivities.
