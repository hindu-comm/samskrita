Kolhatkar Sir,  
Thank you for saying "it is a good attempt".  
Ref your last line: "In this new song, India has been assigned the neutral gender. In Indian vernaculars,भारत is a masculine gender word. Giving it the third gender may jar with many conventional sensitivities."  
  
Yes, Sir.It is true that in our Regional languages, भारत is a masculine gender word. But at some places, I don't remember where, I thought I had read the word "BhAratam" used in Sanskrit to refer to India. With the doubt in mind, I referred to the online "spokenSanskrit.de". Among many meanings given, I found three entries relevant to what I was looking for

|     |     |     | |:----|:----|-----| | .   | \]  |    |

भारत.....adj "inhabitant of भरतवर्ष......(i.e India)"  
भारत......n. "land inhabited by bhArata-s (i.e India)"  
भारत .....n. "India"  
That is why I used "bhAratam". and all the relevant adjectives in their accusative singular.  
Submitted in all humility,  
...Shreyas

It is a good attempt but the terms 'fatherland' and 'motherland' have become a part of the national vocabulary in many countries. India is generally perceived asभारतमाता, as in the popular sloganभारतमाता की जय. In pictorial representations of India, e.g. in Calendar Art, India is shown as a देवी, wielding a sword. VD Savarkar, in defining the word 'Hindu', called India asपितृभू. Both of these senses are missing in this song.



In this new song, India has been assigned the neutral gender. In Indian vernaculars,भारत is a masculine gender word. Giving it the third gender may jar with many conventional sensitivities.
