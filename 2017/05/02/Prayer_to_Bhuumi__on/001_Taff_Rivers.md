In all probability the source is anonymous, being lost in the mists of time, but you could ask them where they got it from.

समुद्रवसने देवि पर्वतस्तनमण्डले ।  
विष्णुपत्नि नमस्तुभ्यं पादस्पर्शं क्षमस्वमे ॥

  

Samudra-vasane Devi parvata-stana-mannddale \|  
Vishnu-patni namas-tubhyam paada-sparsham kssamasva-me \|\|

  

Oh Mother Earth the Devi Who has the ocean as Her garments and mountains as Her body.  
Who is also the consort of Sri Vishnu, I bow to you; please forgive me for touching you with my feet.
