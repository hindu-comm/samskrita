Many thanks Nagarajji for the trouble you have taken in writing it as a Table. My knowledge of vedic Sanskrit is bordering on zero and that is the problem. I understand the middle sentence.विष्णु:त्वानयतु= May Vishnu lead you.इशे=? (probably Chaturthi vibhakti) andसामामअनुमृताभव=?माम=?,अनुमृता=?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
