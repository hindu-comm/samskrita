\>Many thanks Nagarajji for the trouble you have taken in writing it as a Table. My knowledge of vedic Sanskrit is bordering on zero and that is the problem. I understand the middle sentence.विष्णु:त्वानयतु= May Vishnu lead you.इशे=? (probably Chaturthi vibhakti) andसामामअनुमृताभव=?माम=?,अनुमृता=?

The first line itself is

-ऊं इष एकपदी भव सा मामनुव्रता भव  
विष्णुस्त्वानयतु पुत्रान् विन्दावहै बहूंस्ते संतु जरदष्टय: ।। 1।।

The seven mantras and their meaning in Hindi add given in the link:

The others are confusing. Iam not sure in this also the translation is word to word and perfectly correct.

There are more than one versions.

Here it is strange मामनुव्रता could be मामनुवृता or मामनुसृता correct. It is funny that has become corrupt मामनुमृता भव!!! in some and in our thread माम अनुमृता भव !!!
