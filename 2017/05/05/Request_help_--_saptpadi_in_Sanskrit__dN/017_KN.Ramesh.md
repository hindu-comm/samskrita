Respected Prof.Dr.HN.Bhat ji,

  

My sincere apologies first...

  

The chronological sequence of happening is this:

  

1\) I posted the above reply before your replies.

But my replies needs to be moderated & approved by the moderator and do not appear immediately.

I swear when I typed my reply your replies were not there.

  

2\) I saw Prof. Dr.Nagaraj sir & your replies afterwards.

  

3\) I wondered why my reply has not yet come. Internally, I was thanking the moderator for not approving my reply, as by reading your replies I understood mine are completely absurd.

  

4\) My happiness is short-lived, when my reply is published here.

  

5\) Thanks for taking pain and correcting my reply.

  

6\) Regret for the inconvenience.

  

7\) The correct one with swaras is here:

8\) They very well match with what you & other scholars have said.
