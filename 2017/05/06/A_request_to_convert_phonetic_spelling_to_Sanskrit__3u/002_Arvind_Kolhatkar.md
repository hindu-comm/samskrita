You may use converter [available here](http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript).

  

For this tool to give you accurate Devanagari rendering, your Romanized text has to be in one of the formats like Itrans, IAST, Harvard-Kyoto etc. Since the text given by you is not in any of these, the Devanagari output is not very accurate and you will have to manually edit and correct it.
