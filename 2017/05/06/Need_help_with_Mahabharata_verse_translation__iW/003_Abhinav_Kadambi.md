Namaste,

  

Shri Sunder Hattangadi ji cited these links to me in private:  
  
<https://archive.org/details/Mahabharata_with_Hindi_Translation_-_SD_Satwalekar>

  

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mahabharata-links.html>

  
I think the Hindi translation by Shri S D Satwalekar is an appropriate reference.

  

Thank you all who took the time to answer my query.
