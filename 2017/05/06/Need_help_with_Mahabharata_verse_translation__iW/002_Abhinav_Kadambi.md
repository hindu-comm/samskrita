Namaste Arvind ji,

  

Thank you. I have already checked the said link before posting my query. It is not a direct sloka-by-sloka translation. Some of the details and visheshana padas are omitted for ease, I believe. I am looking for an online resource which could provide a suitable translation of the kind available for Valmiki Ramayana as in [here](http://www.valmikiramayan.net).

  

Thank you once again.
