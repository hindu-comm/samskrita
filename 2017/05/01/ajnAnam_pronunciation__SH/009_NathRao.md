Can somebody attach or upload to a suitable place an audio file of the pronunciation of ज्ञ as  
*affricate* ज् + ञ् + अ? I don't think that I have ever heard it, but would like to. If you have access to a phonetics lab, more detailed info, including pictures of the tongue positions would be welcome :-^)  
  
The various "mispronunciations" seem to come from adjusting this: If the friction of "j" is reduced, we get "y" (of course, there is also regional alternation between "j" and "y", even in the pronunciation of Vedas: listen to ApastambhIyas). If it is made into a stop we get a (possibly palatalized) g, but this g is produced more to the front than the usual "g:". It should be noted that historically "j" results from an affrication of a such a stop. \[Please don't start a flame war about historical linguistics.\] Marathi speakers are supposed to say "dz" for "j" \[I am not good enough phonetician to tell the difference\]; then, "dny", perhaps really "d"+nasalized y, would the understandable loss of "z" in this difficulat to say position. Note that "s" is lost if it occurs in a stop+s+stop cluster, like in utthiSTaH (really ut+sthitaH).
