Dear Mr. Vivek,  
  

I fully agree with you --

  
"Since the word ज्ञानम् is pronounced as jnanam and अज्ञानम् as ajnanam I feel it should be pronounced as it is written"  
  

and personally I too opine as such.  
  

However, in the Hindi-speaking belt, these words 'ज्ञानम्' and 'अज्ञानम्' are pronounced as 'gyaanam' and 'agyaanam' respectively since the letter 'ज्ञ', wherever it occurs, is pronounced as 'gya' in that belt. Yet, the Hindi-speaking people would retain its written form as it is, i.e., 'ज्ञ' (jna).  
  

But as far as Sanskrit is concerned, the letter 'ज्ञ' should be pronounced as 'jna' only wherever it occurs.  
  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
