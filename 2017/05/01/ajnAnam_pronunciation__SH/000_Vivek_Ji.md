Hari Om,

  

I’m having a doubt about pronunciation of the wordअज्ञानम्

  

Since the word ज्ञानम् is pronounced as jnanam and अज्ञानम् as ajnanam I feel it should be pronounced as it is written. But many times I hear people say it more like, “agjnanam”

  

There is noग् in there but still I hear it.

  

Is there a certain rule that most people pronounce it as agjnanam?

  

Welcoming any feedback,

Vivek
