Paninis Skiksha and grammar books like Siddhanta Kaumudi provide us with the necessary details (वर्णोत्पत्ति स्थानानि + प्रयत्नाः) for the pronunciation of Samskrit letters. In case of letters ज, ञ and ज्ञ (as ज्ञ = ज् + ञ् + अ), the वर्णोत्पत्ति स्थानम् given in Siddhanta Kaumudi is इचुयशानां तालु.  
  
Probably most times such texts are taught academically and not sufficient effort is made to explain & show correct pronunciation of letters & words and therefore Samskrit pronunciation gets influenced by pronunciation of same letters & words in local Indian languages. It is another unfortunate matter that many teachers & sanskritists themselves do not pronounce as per such teachings.  
  
As to writing ज्ञ in english (roman letters), I would prefer 'jna' over 'dnya'. The reason being pronunciation of consonant ज् is equal to 'j' and the nasal 'na' can get pronounced properly as ञ due to सन्धिः happening naturally while pronouncing. Whereas in 'dnya', the introduction of 'd' can cause confusion as there is no 'd' that gets pronounced in ज्ञ and there is no 'y' too.
