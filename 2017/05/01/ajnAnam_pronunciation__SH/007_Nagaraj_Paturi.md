\>*Since godly scientific Sanskrit can't be challenged and can't be simplified, Sanskrit pundits ended up creating various scripts under different rulers to earn their livelihood.*

*----* This is not the first time this ken p writing this kind of politically incorrect stuff insulting 'Sanskrit Pundits' or such communities.

  

Scripts are not created by a certain scholar or group of scholars or a body of scholars. At least in modern times we find attempts to devise or create scripts for certain tribal languages in the process of 'developing' the tribe. But during pre-modern times, scripts evolved in a gradual course. There are studies on how the scripts such as Siddham, Devanaagari, Nandinaagari etc. evolved in course of time from the northern branch of Brahmi. There are no livelihood issues involved in such evolution. The same aspects of requirement of written communication, writing materials etc. which are involved in the script in any part of the world are involved here too.

  

dny is one of the roman transliteration codes used forज्ञ only. The pronunciation does not involve any retroflex voiced ड or dental voiced द even when it is written as dny.

  

The issue raised is very much valid, since some gn is a frequent mispronunciation forज्ञ.

  

When it is said that Sanskrit is pronounced as written, they contrast Sanskrit with English and intend to say that Devanaagari or any other Indian script does not have issues lie put-but tough-through etc.
