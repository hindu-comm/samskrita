I have come across the statement that the thee compound consonants क्ष, त्र and ज्ञ are pronounced somewhat different from the constituent consonants. That is why these three compound consonants are sometimes included as part of the alphabet. In Sankara's Annapoornashtakam, आदिक्षान्त समस्त - all sounds from अ to क्ष - includes क्ष as part of alphabet. क्ष and ज्ञ appear to have more regional variations in their pronunciations and hence in their transliterations.
