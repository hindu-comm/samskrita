At Least in Marathi,ज्ञ is pronounced as if it is dnya. Bothअज्ञानम् andज्ञानम् are pronounced as 'adnyaanam' and 'dnyaanam'. Listen to Bhimsen Joshi singing a bhajan [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZtb0zq6ikU)at 1.12. It is 'dnyaaniyaachaa Raajaa' orज्ञानियाचा राजा. This is different than the Hindi 'Gyaniyaachaa Raajaa' but I have no complaint. Sanskrit pronunciations do differ from place to place and there is no way of telling which is the most authentic.
