Dear list members,

  

I have searched the on-line digital libraries of Sanskrit religious literature (Muktabodha, GRETIL, Mahabharata, Ramayana) for gayatri mantras to the different gods and goddesses. While there are over a thousand gayatri mantras to the different gods and goddesses in the different texts in these digital libraries (Vedic texts, post-vedic texts, Puranas, Tantric and Agamic texts) there were no gayatri mantras to SarasvatI.

  

Do any of the list members know why there are so few or no gayatri mantras to Sarasvati when there are so many to the other gods and goddesses.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
