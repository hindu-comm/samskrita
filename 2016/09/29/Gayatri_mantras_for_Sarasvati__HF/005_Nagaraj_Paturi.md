I specifically said 'Puja as in temples' , because Saraswati's significance as a Vedic goddess is not less.

  

In fact, interestingly, it is a coincidence that you brought up the question of Gayatri mantras (plural),though notTHE Gayatri Mantra (unique, without plural)andit is this THE Gayatri Mantra that is used for Saraswathi Upaasanaa on the basis that Saraswathi is viewed as the synonym of Savitri, the devata contained in THE Gayatri Mantra.

  

vAgdEvI upAsanA of the Vedas is found to have taken the form of Sri Vidya and the entire Sri Vidya, from this perspective, can be viewed as vAgdEvI upAsanA only. (My father published a lot on Sri Vidya from this perspective, but that is in Telugu)

  

Devi temples with a Sri Vidya background can all be viewed as temple forms of vAgdEvI upAsanAonly from this perspective.

  

What is rare is a temple for the vINApANi form of Sarasvati, thepauraNika concept of wife of Brahma.

  

Rarity of temples for Brahma himself may explain the rarity of Sarasvati temples.

  

Rarity , which is taken as 'absence', of Brahma temples, though is 'explained' by myths such as thenarrative of lingodbhava from the jvAlAmUrti of S'iva, may have other reasonsat the actual historical level.

  

Iconjectured that it is the absence of a source in folk culture which is the equal partner in the amalgamation of Vedic and folk cultures that resulted in temple culture. The same may explain the rarity of Saraswati temples too.

  

You might want to have a look at the compilation of my posts to a list on the Vishnu andDevi concepts in which I covered the idea of the amalgamation of Vedic and folk cultures that resulted in temple culture. Sharing a pdf of the same.
