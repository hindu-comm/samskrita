One good way of approaching this question is probably to see if all the Gayatri mantras are found are to the deities having a puja as in a temple.

  

If that matches, the answer to your question is obvious, as you know, puja as in a temple to Saraswati is very rare.

  

In the temples of Saraswati that I know, that are close to my place, the idol is in fact that of Rajarajeswari , the highest of the Srividya concepts and the Saraswati is viewed as one of the three forms (Mahakali, Mahalakshmi andMahasaraswati.) 'Mahasaraswati' of Rajarajeswari, here.

  

Accordingly most of the mantra routine in these temples is also addressed to Rajarajeswari.
