Dear Harry,

  

Thanks for the wishes.

  

Happy Navaratri to you too.

  

Sorry for the delay in my response. I had to chase a few deadlines.

  

Now coming to Savitri being a synonym for sarasvati, the one source that comes to my mind immediately is Matsyapurana.

  

(I am copying this to the list it may interest a few others too.)

  

In the fourth chapter, there comes the conversation between Manu and Matsyanarayana where Manu expresses his disgust towards the incestuous nature of the story of Brahma's copulation with his daughter. In answer to this Matsyanarayana tells Manu that meaning of myths are not to be taken literally as they do not belong to the gross creation but are part of 'primordial' creation which is subtle and meanings of that are to be taken through a subtle visionsuited to understanding such mythical world.

  

As part of that, he says:

  

divyeyamādisṛṣṭistu rajoguṇasamudbhavā /  
atīndriyendriyā tadvad atīndriyaśarīrikā // MatsP_4.3 //  
divyatejomayī bhūpa divyajñānasamudbhavā /  
na martyairabhitaḥ śakyā vaktuṃ vai māṃsacakṣubhiḥ // MatsP_4.4 //  
yathā bhujaṃgāḥ sarpāṇām ākāśaṃ viśvapakṣiṇām /  
vidanti mārgaṃ divyānāṃ divyā eva na mānavāḥ // MatsP_4.5 //  
kāryākārye na devānāṃ śubhāśubhaphalaprade /  
yasmāttasmānna rājendra tadvicāro nṛṇāṃ śubhaḥ // MatsP_4.6 //  
anyacca sarvavedānām adhiṣṭhātā caturmukhaḥ /  
***gāyatrī*** brahmaṇastadvad aṅgabhūtā nigadyate // MatsP_4.7 //  
amūrtaṃ mūrtimad vāpi mithunaṃ tatpracakṣate /  
viriñcir yatra bhagavāṃs tatra devī ***sarasvatī*** /  
***bhāratī*** yatra yatraiva tatra tatra prajāpatiḥ // MatsP_4.8 //  
yathātapo na rahitaś chāyayā dṛśyate kvacit /  
***gāyatrī*** brahmaṇaḥpārśvaṃ tathaiva na vimuñcati // MatsP_4.9 //  
vedarāśiḥ smṛto brahmā ***sāvitrī*** tadadhiṣṭhitā /  
tasmānna kaściddoṣaḥ syāt ***sāvitrī***gamane vibho // MatsP_4.10 //

  

It may be noted that the words gāyatrī, bhāratī , sarasvatī and sāvitrī have been used as synonyms to each other.

  

( Brahmā is the aggregate of the Vedas. gāyatrī is viewed as his daughter as gāyatrīis anga =part of the aggregate of the Vedas. But since gāyatrī/ bhāratī/ sarasvatī/sāvitrī is inseparable from Brahmā the creator, the aggregate of the Vedas, Brahmā and gāyatrī/ bhāratī/ sarasvatī/sāvitrīare considered to be a couple)
