Michael,

I am attaching a screen shot from Windows 10 machine using Google Chrome.

For the website in the screenshot I tried to see the meaning of one word and it gave the moving wheel for long time and when I moved the mouse it disappeared. Is this a bug? or do I need to enable something in the setting?

  

Regards

Raama
