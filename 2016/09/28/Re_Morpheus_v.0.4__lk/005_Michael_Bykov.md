Plugin for FF is not ready for now.I hope that I will send it to the review to FF in the near future. However, check-review in FF developer team also takes some time, unlike Chrome, where everything is instantaneous. FF team really cares about safety. I will write here as soon as the plugin will be available, but probably it'll take one or two weeks.
