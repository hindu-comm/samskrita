The book 'Brahmavid Asirvada Paddhati' of Sri Vidyaranya Swamigal was released by Sri Periyaval yesterday at Vijayawada during Viswarupa Yatra. It is a fundamental Vedantic text, couched beautifully in the form of prayer. This prayer is usually chanted by Sanyasis during Chaturmasyam in front of the Acharyas. The book, as released, contains an interesting article on Sri Mahaswamigal and Sri Vidyaranya Swamigal. The text has been translated into English by me as instructed by the Acharyas.

The book is attached.
