hariH OM,

"There are other reasons too, the chief among them being that theअद्वैतphilosopher in him would not descend yo the level of offering devotion to any physical deity and composing poetry,, extolling the virtues of this or that deity."

 Completely off. All quibbling and cavilling.  
1. Mr. Arjunwadkar doesn't seem to have read the original works of AcArya. Advaita and bhakti aren't in any way opposite to each other. Even a cursory look at the bhAShyas would have enlightened him to that extent.  
2. The dakShiNAmUrtistotra for which sureshvarAcArya has written a detailed commentary (mAnasollAsa) is another example where Adya sha\~NkarAcArya has "extolled the virtues of this or that deity". Now, please go ahead and find arguments to say dakShiNAmUrtistotra wasn't written by Adya sha\~NkarAcArya and the commentary wasn't written by sureshvarAcArya.

What sort of a monumental ignorance is this! If not ignorance, we have to think that Mr. Arjunwadkar had other axes to grind. May be he had an intense urge to conform to his white skinned peers. In any case, his words reek of arrogance and self conceit.

svasti,  
 bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,  
 shrivathsa.
