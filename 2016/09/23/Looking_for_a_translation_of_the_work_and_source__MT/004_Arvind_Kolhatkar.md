Dear List,



It is a fact that most of the popular stotras, in Sanskrit as well as in regional languages, have no documented history behind them. The history of the vast stotra literature appears to be a subject which has not received any attention from the scholars. I have been trying to find any book or academic paper on this subject but so far have not found anything. If anyone in this Group is aware of any such book I shall be very much obliged if he points it out to me.



Do we know who was बुधकौशिक who composed the रामरक्षास्तोत्र or
पुष्पदन्त who composed the शिवमहिम्नस्तोत्र? These strotras as recited by thousands each day but we do not know how old they are, who composed them and when and where. 



In the absence of any known history, legends get attached to the popular stotras. One such legend is to attach the name ofआदि शंकराचार्यto a popular stotra.. Counting all peethas, there have been hundreds ofशंकराचार्यs over the last 12 centuries, many of them quite erudite and also with the poetic faculty. A stotra composed by any one of them would be called श्रीमच्छंकराचार्यविरचितम्. Taking off from there, we presume that it was composed by आदि शंकराचार्य. But what is the historical evidence for saying so?



Let me now say something specifically about theगणेशपञ्चरत्नस्तोत्र.
The late Dr KS Arjunwadkar, Professor of Sanskrit in Pune, had contributed a paper to the 'Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute', Vol. 85 (2004), which had the title 'Panegyrics on Śiva Group Ascribed to Shankara: A Critical Study.' In this paper he had examined the whole range of several popular stotras traditionally attributed to Shankara and had given several reasons to reject such attributions.  Specifically for गणेशपञ्चरत्नस्तोत्र, he has observed the following defects and shortcomings, which he thinks are unworthy of आदि शंकराचार्य:



1) A conscious effort to create a sound effect -सुरेश्वरं निधीश्वरं गजेश्वरं गणेश्वरं\|महेश्वरं... V.2

2) Inappropriate use of a word and an unnecessary use of पादपूरक to balance the meter -महागणेशपञ्चरत्नमादरेण योऽन्वहं,प्रजल्पति प्रभातके ह्रदि स्मरन् गणेश्वरम् ॥ v. 6

Here, प्रजल्पति strictlymeans ';jabbering.' To use it in the sense of 'reciting' is beneath आदि शंकराचार्य.  Inप्रभातके,the पादपूरक केis added only to balance the requirement of the meter. It makes the language very inelegant.

3) In V.5,ह्रदन्तरे निरन्तरं वसन्तमेव योगिनां,तमेकदन्तमेव तं विचिन्तयामि संततम् ,the use ofएव twice is superfluous and undeserving of आदि शंकराचार्य.



These are some of the reasons, for which he thinks that the गणेशपञ्चरत्नस्तोत्र is unlikely to have been composed by आदि शंकराचार्य.
There are other reasons too, the chief among them being that the अद्वैत philosopher in him would not descend yo the level of offering devotion to any physical deity and composing poetry,, extolling the virtues of this or that deity.
