\> Do we know who was बुधकौशिक who composed the रामरक्षास्तोत्र or
पुष्पदन्त who composed the शिवमहिम्नस्तोत्र? (Highlighting mine)

  

My father published athorroughly researched , well argued and intensely substantiated book proposing that 'पुष्पदन्त' who composed the शिवमहिम्नस्तोत्र is none other than Kaatyaayana Vararuchi , one of the Munitraya of the VaiyaakaraNa tradition.

  

The book is in Telugu. I am bringing out into English soon.
