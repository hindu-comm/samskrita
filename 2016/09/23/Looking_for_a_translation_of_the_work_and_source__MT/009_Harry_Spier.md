Dear Arvind,

  

The papers and books on the stotra literature that I know of a:

(though I don't know if any of them qualify as "a history of the literature" but are more of a description of the literature). I have pdfs of Gudrun Buhnemanns and Hamsa Staintons papers which I can send you if you wish.

  

Stotra Literature by J. Gonda chapter 14 of Medieval Religious Literature by J. Gonda. (His footnotes refer to other books on stotra literature for example: The Stotra Literature of Old India by S. Bhattacharyya

  

Some Remarks on the Structure and Application of Hindu Sanskrit Stotras by Gudrun Buhnemann
