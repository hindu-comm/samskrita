Dear List,

  

I cannot answer the following question in this thread \<Maybe someone knows the source of this स्तोत्रम्.> but can hazard a guess about its period.

  

Ganapati-Gajanana, the Remover of obstacles, prayed at the beginning of every deed, is not a very ancient deity. Its influence arose roughly in the last 1000 years. Prior to that he was one among the many followers of Shiva. We can see that in none of the texts older than 1000 years is there any invocation to Ganesha at the beginning. Foe example, none of Kalidasa's works starts with a salutation to Ganesha. But Jnaneshwari of Saint Jnaneshwar, a commentary on the Gita, which is extremely popular in Maharashtra, especially among the adherents of the Warkari Panth, starts with an invocation to Ganeshaदेवा तूंचि गणेशु \|

सकलमति प्रकाशु \|. Jnaneswari was composed in the 13th century.

  

Therefore any stotra, composed in praise of Ganesha, would be datable to a period after 1000 AD.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
