To reject the authorship of the presently known author of a stotra, particularly in the case of those attributed to (Adi) Sankaracharya has already become beaten track and cliché in the academic circles, though at a popular level, these critical studiesare yet to make impact.

  

What could be new is to try to establish the acceptable time, place and other details of composition and even the actual author wherever possible.
