I think the statement ‘**any stotra, composed in praise of Ganesha, would be datable to a period after 1000 AD’ is not correct.**

Adi Sankara is credited with गणेश पञ्चरत्नम् (मुधाकरात्त मोदकम् . . .)

　

Lord Ganesa is a Vedic Deity and is praised in the Vedas.

　

The first sloka of the Rig Veda:

अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवं रत्वीजम \|  
होतारं रत्नधातमम \|\| Rig Veda 1.001.01

　

It could be that the custom of eulogising Ganesa in the beginning of book, composition, or commencement of work started within the last 1000 years.
