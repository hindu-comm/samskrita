Nagaraj,  

  

A dash of poetic license is all that's required for *'upward roots and downward branches*' to be very real indeed.

  

With a fig plant, rather than a fig tree, birds will eat the fruits and drop the seed into the cracks of tree, where they grow, theirroots hanging down in the air, the tree's branches, above.

  

Picture attached to see for yourself.

  

Coming down to earth from the greatest of poetic heights, it can be seen that all that anyone ever actually experiences, is experienced *inside* the head, the *source* of that experience may derive from *out there* in the real world as the dazzling light of even a single sun, does its dazzling right here, the source is rather further away and anyway a bit too big to fit into even the largest of heads!

  

Metaphorically to correct the common illusion that existence is the other way around.

  

Then there is the source of *experience* itself, that dwells within and otherwise known as consciousness, pure consciousness.

The realization of which is not exactly unknown.

As the man says, create the circumstances and the result will appear... no imagination required, just effort.

  

  

Taff,
