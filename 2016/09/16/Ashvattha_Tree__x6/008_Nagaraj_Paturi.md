The logic is this:

  

Ashvattha is as popularly understood is Peepal.

  

The esoteric /symbolism based /allegorical/metaphorical text under question is using this word and as a not realistic image, it is using the image of an upside down tree.

  

Only if the upside down image of peepal does not help understand the details of description, we need to search for an alternative meaning such as a Banyan tree for the word Ashvattha.

  

Because there is so such need, taking Peepal as the meaning is justified.
