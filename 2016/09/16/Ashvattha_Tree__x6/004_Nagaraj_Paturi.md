After posting the points below here, I found this website which has a picture of an upside down tree.

  

<http://www.indianscriptures.com/vedic-lifestyle/food-and-health/peepal>

  

But the idea conveyed may not be accurate.

  

All the aachaaryas across the various schools of Vedanta took the ashvattha tree being described here as samsara vriksha = the tree of 'this wordly existence' or 'the tree of birth-death cycle'

  

All the aachaaryas took the upside down nature of the tree as Brahma (the creator) up spreading to the world of the created humans and other creatures.

  

All of them quote mantras and s'lokas from s'ruti and puraaNas with this ashvattha tree metaphor/allegory , interestingly most of them having the image of an upside down tree.
