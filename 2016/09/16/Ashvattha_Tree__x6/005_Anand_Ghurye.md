The article referred by you introduces another complication . It says Peepal and Plaksha are same , but other references say that these are two different trees.

  

Why I refer to Banyan , is its branches sprout roots which grow downwards and then having reached the soil regrow into trees . This fits the description better than the peepal tree .
