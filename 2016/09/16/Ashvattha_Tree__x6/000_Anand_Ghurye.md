Dear Sirs ,

  

Ashwattha is commonly translated at Peepal Tree . Ficus Religiosa . While Shri Krishna in Srimad Bhagwad Geeta 15.1 refers to Ashvattha tree as having roots above and branches below . This description fits banyan tree better .

  

When I see Monier Williams , it says Ficus Religiosa which is peepal tree , while some translations of Shrimad Bhagwad Geeta translate Ashwattha as Banyan tree .

  

Please help clarify . Thanks in advance.

  
  
  
Regards ,
