Dear Anand Ghuryeji,

  

It is a riddle-like expression. It is a Peepal tree only. Theupward roots and downward branches is not a realistic picture of a tree. It is an imaginary picture of an upside down tree.

  

यस्तं वेद स वेदवित्

  

clearly shows that it is a riddle-like expressions.

  

One who can solve this riddle can be considered to have understood the Veda.
