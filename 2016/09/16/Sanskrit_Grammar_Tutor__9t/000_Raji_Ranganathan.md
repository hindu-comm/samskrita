Hi  
  
I would like to understand Sanskrit Grammar in detail , have basic knowledge. Pursuing correspondence course and hence looking for a tutor to help me coach.  
Is there anyone available or recommended who can teach me the language authentically.  
  
Following online grammar tutorial links but have doubts which a tutor can help.  
Please point to if anyone out there.  
  
Thanks  
Raji
