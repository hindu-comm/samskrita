shrI dAmodara has now made available the most beautiful stardict dictionary I've yet seen (Original source[here](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VEIScan/2014/web/index.php).).

Puru-kutsais the name of a king who is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. In one passage¹he is mentioned as a contemporary ofSudās,but whether as a foe, according to Ludwig,²or merely as a contemporary, according to Hillebrandt,³is uncertain. In two other passages⁴he is mentioned as victorious by divine favour, and in another⁵he appears as a king of thePūrusand a conqueror of theDāsas.His son wasTrasadasyu,⁶who is accordingly calledPaurukutsya⁷orPaurukutsi.⁸Different conclusions have been drawn from one hymn of the Rigveda⁹in which the birth of Purukutsa's son,Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is thatPurukutsawas killed in battle or captured, whereupon his wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But Sieg¹⁰offers a completely different interpretation. According to him the worddaurgahe,which occurs in the hymn, and which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant ofDurgaha,’ an ancestor ofPurukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn recording the success of anAśvamedha(‘horse sacrifice’) undertaken byPurukutsafor his wife, as by kings in later times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the version ofdaurgahegiven in the Śatapatha,¹¹but is by no means certain. Moreover, ifPurukutsawas a contemporary ofSudās, the defeat of the Pūrus bySudāsin theDāśarājña¹²might well have been the cause of the troubles from whichPurukutsānī,by the birth ofTrasadasyu, rescued the family. In the ŚatapathaBrāhmaṇa¹³Purukutsais called anAikṣvāka.

Installation is very simple in most cases!

If you have Android 5.0+, you can use[this Stardict Dictionary Installer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sanskritcode.sanskritdictionaryupdater)to install some common dictionaries in one shot. ( I am aware that lower android versions have problems.)

-   Ratings
    certificate:[here](https://iarcweb.azurewebsites.net/Dashboard/Certificate/74e40614-671c-421e-9969-1c80da21a267). -   Code for this is available for any one to copy and
    modify[here](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/stardict-dictionary-updater).
    (May a 1000 apps bloom!) If you want to contribute new dictionaries
    to the[stardict-sanskrit
    project](https://github.com/vvasuki/stardict-sanskrit), that is
    welcome too. -   On some phones, this app crashes. A fix is not known. (Error
    profile[here](http://i.imgur.com/rDuWodM.png).) Consider
    using<https://github.com/nangia/pydictupdater>instead.

On general Android devices, use<https://github.com/nangia/pydictupdater>.

Instructions from aupAsana.com[here](http://www.aupasana.com/stardict).

Still having trouble despite the above? Further workaround tips (if they are necessary) for Android are[in this email](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sanskrit-programmers/6kvUHtJfzQE/WrQLZeS-n_AJ).

Downloading dictionaries to a desktop computer (whatever OS with git or python installed) in one shot

You could just git clone repositories you're interested in. Eg:

-   git clone g...@github.com:sanskrit-coders/stardict-hindi.git;git
    clone g...@github.com:sanskrit-coders/stardict-sanskrit.git;git
    clone g...@github.com:sanskrit-coders/stardict-kannada.git;git clone
    g...@github.com:sanskrit-coders/stardict-pali.git

Or you can use<https://github.com/nangia/pydictupdater>

Recommendations for dictionary apps

Android:

-   Goldendict
    (paid):[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.goldendict.android). -   Unstable
    alternatives:[colordict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.colordict).

Desktop computers:[Goldendict](http://goldendict.org/download.php).

-   In ubuntu, you can do:sudo apt-get install goldendict -   In mac - use[0.8
    dmg](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/goldendict/goldendict-0.8.0-macosx.dmg).
    Note from ajita: "The one problem I have with that version is that
    if I leave it running in the background, and allow the laptop to go
    to sleep, it crashes. So, I typically exit out of goldendict once
    I'm done with it."
