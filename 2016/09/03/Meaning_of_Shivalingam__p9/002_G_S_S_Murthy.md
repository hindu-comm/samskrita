I also went through the paper. In 2_D polar coordinate system, distance from a fixed point (radius) and angle from a base line which passes through the chosen fixed point (centre) form the 2 coodinates. How Mr.Singh has assigned the angle co-ordinate is not clear to me. I do see an outline of a linga as represented in temples along with yoni in the drawing provided.
