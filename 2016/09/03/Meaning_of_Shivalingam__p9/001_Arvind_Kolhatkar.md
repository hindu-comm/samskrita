I diligently went through the paper but could not understand a thing.

  

I do see a set of 9 concentric circles and some of the letters, not all, appearing as points on them. No explanation is provided as to why those points appear where they do. I believe most people would be baffled by what you call as 'polar coordinates' and representation of the Maheshwar Sutras through them. Also is not clear as to what are those '14 points' through which the figure of the Shivalinga appears. (I can count 14 points that make out the polygonal figures marked in yellow, blue and red inks but what is the significance of these points has not been explained. I do not see any 'Shivalinga' appearing out of them

  

So please provide some more explanation of 'polar coordinates' for us to understand what you wish to convey.

  

(I have not studied the grammar of Panini but have read that the the 'Maheshwar Sutras' are not so named by Panini himself but appear in the [Nandikeshvara Kashika](https://www.scribd.com/doc/200312544/Nandikesvara-kasika-translation#scribd).
What is the opinion of scholars who have read Panini in the original about the authorship of these 'Maheshwara Sutras.)
