After visualising the Mahabharata Vyasa invoked Brahma. He adviased Vyasa that Ganesa is the right person to tak

take down what he wanted to say.

  

Then Vyasa remembered Ganesa. He immediately appeared before him. Vysasa asked him to be his

stenogrpher. He said that he was ready to be his stenographer but once started taking down he would

not stop. Then Vyasa told him that he should not take down without understanding the meaning.

  

Then Vyasa now and then dictated some slokas which were difficult to understand. When Ganesa stopped for some time to know the meaning Vyasa dictated many more slokas.
