Raji,

  

 There are no tools that can do your homework for you.

  

 At best, they can only offer suggestions.

  

 They may well be perfectly correct grammatically, yet make absolutely no sense otherwise. Even those that take into consideration known and most commonly found word clusters etc.,may miss the mark completely.

  

The best 'tools' are bi-lingual dictionaries. Surely your exercise provider, also provided the vocabulary and grammar to go with them?

  

What particular language skills are you exercising?

There are many bi-lingual English-Sanskrit text books and tutorials available on-line to suit all skill levels.

  

I'm sure the learned ones here will help you out with your homework, and verify it, but not do it for you.

  

 Taff
