Raji ji,

  

Off the cuff accurate translation better not be envisaged. It is an exercise in futility.

  

To quote you what one may end up with machine translations is :

  

A friend once said to another friend, "The spirit is high but the flesh is weak." { It is a quote from bible Matthew 26:41 }

What he intended was that he was mentally agile to carry out certain work but the body was tired.

This sentence was machine translated into Russian language and back into English and the answer was : " The Vodka is excellent but the meat is rotten."

So please be careful.
