Thanks all. I am working out exercises which don't have answers and would like to ascertain I am not wrong.  
  
Joshi ji, as you said when using Sanskrit we need to be careful else the meaning completely changes. Since I am a beginner wanted someone to validate what I am working out. Looking for an online tutor, just a little curious until then:)
