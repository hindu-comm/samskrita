I bow to all the learned ones here.

  

Meaning of word 'वृषल' has been taken as शूद्र, आचारच्युत, धर्मच्युत, दस्यु, व्रात्य क्षत्रिय etc. Instead of these, I wish to know the development of this word from the 'roots', धातु with roll out of meaning. Some questions:

  

\(1\) How are धर्म/ वर्ण आचार related to वृष?

\(2\) What does 'ल' suffix mean, if it is suffix?

\(3\) How are 'वृषली' and 'वृषला' different in meaning? What may be the meanings of these words.

  

Regards to you all.
