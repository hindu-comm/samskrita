Dear All,

Greetings and Namaste. As **Sharad Navaratri** is starting on Saturday, I am happy to attach a rare hymn on **Goddess Devi** by **Himavan** taken from **Kurma Puranam, Chapter 11**. This hymn appears immediately after the famous **Devi Sahasranamam** (also known a **Kumari Sahasranamam**).

The essence of this hymn is that **Goddess Shakti** is the **Mula Prakriti** and the origin of universe and She Herself appears as **Brahma**, **Vishnu**, **Shiva** and other deity forms to perform various cosmic functions. The hymn mentions that She portrays Herself in various Rupa's. The hymn is very similar to what **Lord Krishna** describes His various cosmic forms in **Bhagavad Gita** and to **Lord Narayana's Gayatri Stotram** "***Adishakte jaganmAtar bhaktAnugraha kAriNI***".

We have also seen **Lord Narayana's** declaration in **Padma Purana** that He and Shakti are nothing but masculine and feminine forms for the benefit of mankind and upasana to either form leads to the same result. So, the clamour for differentiation among deity forms is the pastime of cantankerous egoists.

May We Seek The Blesssings of The Almighty Who Also Appears In the Form of Goddess Shakti! Once again hearty greetings for Navaratri/Dasara festivities.
