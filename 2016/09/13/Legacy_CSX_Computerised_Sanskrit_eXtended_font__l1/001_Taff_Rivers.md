All,

  

 I now have the CSX+ fonts I sought, in both Open type and Adobe formats. These are readily available as I have since discovered.

  

 However, I still seekCharles Wikner's font-a different font, which I should have made clear.

  

 It is a postscript font, (Unix) which he had developed himself in the early days, to produce his *Sanskrit Introductory*.

  

 A postscript to open type (Windows) font conversion would therefore have been needed.

  

 In the meantime, I'll try and locate a good conversion tool, myself.

  

Thanks again,

î—“
