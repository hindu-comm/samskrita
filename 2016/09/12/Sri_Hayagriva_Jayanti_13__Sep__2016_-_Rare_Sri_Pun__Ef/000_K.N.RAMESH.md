Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As tomorrow (Tuesday, 13th Sep 2016) is **Sri Hayagriva Jayanti**, I am happy to attach a very rare **Ashtottara Shata Namavali** on **Lord Pundarikaksha**, the presiding deity of one of the 108 Divya Desams known as **Shvetagiri** (currently known as **Thiruvellarai**) near **Trichy** in Tamil Nadu. As mentioned before, the hymns on **Lord Hayagriva** in Purans are not that many and I have shared whatever I have seen before and therefore sharing a generic Vishnu Ashtottaram.

  

The **Thiruvellarai** temple is very ancient and is claimed to precede even Srirangam Temple and is presumed to have been built by **Shibi Chakravarty**, King of Ayodhya. This is a massive temple with unfinished **Rajagopuram** and relatively less known with fewer visitors. **Sage Markandeya** is also said to have performed penance here. Please refer to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundarikakshan_Perumal_Temple> and other websites relating to this temple.

  

It is also mentioned that those who are having unfavorable planetary movements, especially **Jupiter in the 10th** while undergoing **Sade Sathi** (Saturn's 7-1/2 year cycle) at the same time, will get relieved of the dosha with a darshan to this temple.

  

It took me almost 5 years to get a copy of this Ashottaram and I feel happy to share this. I am sure there are many many such Ashtottarams/Sahasranamas which are either already extinct or close to extinction. If people could do their bit to get hold of a copy of their own village temple sthala purana and associated stotras, it will be a great service to mankind.

  

May We Pray Lord Hayagriva and Lord Pundarikaksha with this special Ashtottaram.
