That's right only fragments just like Trialokya-sammohana-tantra. I am looking for both Brhad Gautamiya and Trialokya-sammohana-tantra to have them transliterated and upload them on Gaudiya Grantha Mandira website but I haven't had any success barring that there is Sammohana Tantra in the Library of Orrisa, but I am not sure if its the same one used by the Sad Goswamis. Gautamiya Tantra has a tika commentary which is preserved in a library in Bengal.
