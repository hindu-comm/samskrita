Dear Listfolk,  
  
Can anyone find any online copy of the Bá¹›had-Gautamiya Tantra?(Not to be confused with the Gautamiya-Tantra)? Or even offline where it(a copy) can be purchased,if not available anywhere? I've not been able to trace it on either Scribd or [archive.org](http://archive.org).  
  
Thanks in advance.
