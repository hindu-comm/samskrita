I found that these books are available from the home of Amritsarya Ram Bhanot in village Sahlon, Nawanshahr, Punjab.

The daughter-in-law of Shri Ram Bhanot and his grandson are staying there and they have these books.  
  
This is one of the most complete and authoritative tika on the Bhagavad Gita.

It contains all 700 verses in sanskrit and a complete grammatical analysis and a hindi tika.

  
Jai Gurudev

Ashwini
