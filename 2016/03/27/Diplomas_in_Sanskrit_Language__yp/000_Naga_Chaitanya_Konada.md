Hari Om,

  

I live in Hyderabad and currently in software profession.

  

But, my love for Sanskrit language and India's classical literature is always guiding me to learn Sanskrit as much as I can.

  

I am interested in taking a diploma/degree course on correspondence in Sanskrit Literature.

  

Requesting the guidance from learned people here for best options in Hyderabad or around.

  

Thanks in advance.
