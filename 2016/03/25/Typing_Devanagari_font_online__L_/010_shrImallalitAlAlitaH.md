The conventional keyboard has limited number of keys which are assigned to English alphabets.

When we map devanAgarI or any similar letter to them, it is obvious that the keyboard will not entertain then in straight way.

We may be able to map स and श to 's' and 'shif+s'; but what about ष.

Similarly, we may map द and ड to 'd' and 'shift+d', but what about ध and ढ.

We have to compromise.

So, we try to put most similar sounds of devanAgarI, etc. to similar sounding Roman alphabet.

Then we consider left letters and map them to key which may not have matching sound, or may not have a sound at all(like , , etc.)

Even then we try to put similar sound on one key.

  

This is what I tried with medhA IME which was created for personal use. It has helped many.
