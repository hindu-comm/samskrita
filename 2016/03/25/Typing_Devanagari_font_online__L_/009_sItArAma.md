Agreed BolNagari is bit better but f/F for ट/ठ is counter intuitive as well I had modify Bolnagari in Ubuntu  

Some is true for श ञ ज्ञ, ड ढ ङ  

Much better than Inscript but like I said it all depends on which one you got used to. For me and few others I know this worked great for Windows and Mac
