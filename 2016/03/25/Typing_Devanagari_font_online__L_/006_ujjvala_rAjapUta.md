Android, Ubuntu, Windows (from 7 onwards, even XP, but you must configure during setup in that case), all come with settings to enable one to type in most of the Unicode scripts. Devanagari is no exception. These native methods are very efficient and best for the respective OS. You do not need to rely on any third party software, mentioned in the posts above or otherwise.
