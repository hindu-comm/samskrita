This is a very interesting question, indeed. There are two types of keyboards available for most Indic scripts. One kind is like what you mentioned (t for उ), known as INSCRIPT layout. The other (called Bolnagari, for देवनागरी, or a similar "KaKhaGa phonetic") is based on some intuitive mapping from Roman to देवनागरी based loosely on sounds (u for उ). The second one (Bolnagari) is also available on Ubuntu (I am not sure about Windows). It allows for new users to start typing quickly. But there are a few issues. Users can begin fast using Bolnagari layout but in the long run the INSCRIPT is more efficient. Moreover, while Bolnagari is based on Roman keyboard (which in turn preserves useless historical developments, like homage to Qwert Yuiop), the INSCRIPT layout, designed by C-DAC is based on more fundamental concepts (like keeping vowels together, vyanjans arranged properly according to the वर्ग, etc.) Users of INSCRIPT don't need to remember where U is in the Roman keyboard. That's the reason I think it is better.  
  
So if anyone wants to type देवनागरी for a very little time, use the Bolnagari or KaKhaGa phonetic keyboard. If you want to type regularly, the INSCRIPT layout can be learned in a week, giving ten minutes per day.
