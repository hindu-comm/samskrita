Did you look at this link? It clearly shows the key combination on top of each image on the link I shared.  
<https://ubcsanskrit.ca/keyboards.html>  

It solves that very problem thats why I like it.  

स - s  

श - S  

ष - Option+S / Alt+S  
  

द - d  

ध - D  

ड - Option D / Ctrl + Alt D  

ढ - Option+shift D / Ctrl + Alt+Shift +D  

  

I have Mac so left option key becomes really handy (I don't have to hold 3 keys and press D). But I used the keyboard with equal ease in windows. and Created my own layout in Ubuntu on Mac machine - matching this arrangement.  

Ukulele is a good software interface to create your own layout

There is no right or wrong method, whichever one is one comfortable with.
