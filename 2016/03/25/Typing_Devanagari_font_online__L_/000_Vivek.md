Hari Om,  
  
I have seen many sites, including this email list where the Devanagari font is used.  
  
I’d like to do the same, also include it on documents that I create in Office Word.  
  
What’s the most universal way of doing this, a way to share with others online and through documents that won;t mess up the text?  
  
Many thanks,  
Vivek
