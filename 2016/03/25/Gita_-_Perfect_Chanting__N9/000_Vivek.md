Hari Om,  
  
Glad I found this group. So much wonderful content has been shared here. So many nice and helpful people.  
  
There is Bhagavad Gita chanting recording by Vyoma Labs.  
  
I’m wondering if anyone has heard it and if it’s absolutely perfect chanting.  
  
Here is their website: <http://vyomalabs.com>  
  
Thanks,  
Vivek
