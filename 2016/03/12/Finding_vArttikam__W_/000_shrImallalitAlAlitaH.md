I'm going through a text which quotes some vArttikam as  
  

> तदुक्तं वार्त्तिके –  
> अभ्युपैम्यर्थवादत्वं न त्वभूतार्थवादताम् ॥  
> - इत्यादि ।

  
I'm sure that the vArttikam is not related to either vyAkaraNa or nyAya.  
  
I tried to trace it in sureshvarAchArya's vArttikam on bRRhadAraNyakopaniShadbhAShya and tattirIyopaniShadbhAShyam.  
  
I also checked kumArila-pAda-s shloka-vArttikam on mImAMsA. I've not checked shloka-s occuring in tantra-vArttikam of the venerated author.  
  
I may have missed the vArttika while searching, owing to my lack of attention. Or, it may not be included in the list of shlokArdha-s.  
  
If someone remembers such vArttikam, please inform here.  
  
If some kind person ventures to finds it while searching list of shloka-s in mentioned or other works, please accept my thanks for doing the search. I request you to submit the result of your kind effort here.
