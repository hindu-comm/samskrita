Thanks for the replies so far. 

  

My teacher uses Colordict regularly on his Android tablet (a Samsung I think) for all of the Sanskrit dictionaries but he finds that the app often crashes or hangs. I wanted to find out if there was a paid alternative that he could use.

  

My understanding is that while Goldendict does have a paid alternative, Goldendict on the Android platform has the limitation of allowing only five dictionary files at a time (or is that limitation restricted to the free app?). Colordict on the other hand allows you to use unlimited dictionary files. However, it looks like there is no premium/paid version of Colordict. 

  

If this is correct, is there any other option for accessing these dictionary files on the Android platform?

  

Thank you very much
