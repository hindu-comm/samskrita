I can place my hand on my heart and vouch that colordict has never hung even after extensive use on my phones (Nexus 5 presently, and an old Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos 6802 earlier. IMHO if it works on the latter, it should on any phone / tab). If it isn't working well with a particular tab, you may contact the developers. In this way, the app user base will benefit. The developers mail ID is [sup...@socialnmobile.com]()
