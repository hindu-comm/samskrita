Many thanks shankara.

I got that book and read.

So, this author appears to be a sannyAsI who wrote rAmArchanachandrikA and rAmatApanIyopaniSad-TIkA. He was pupil of mukunda-vana in sannyAsa-Ashrama.

It appears that we don't have many works of the author available, hence he didn't get mention in the book mentioned by me.

  

I thank you again for kindly presenting your finding here.

I'll be using this knowledge to get meaning of the verse presented in original post.
