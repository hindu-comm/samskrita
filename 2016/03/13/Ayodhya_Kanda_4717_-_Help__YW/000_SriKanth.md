In Ayodhya Kanda, meaning of this shloka is not clear.

  

//

एषा रामेण नगरी रहिता नातिशोभते।

आपगा गरुडेनेव ह्रदादुद्धृतपन्नगा ।। - Ayodhya kandam - 47-17  

  

Bereft of Rama, the aforesaid city of Ayodhya was not any more enchanting than a river

whose snakes were uplifted from its pool by Garuda.

In the commentary, Govindaraja has not given any meaning to this verse. In Rama's tilaka commentary, its given as "रामेण रहिता एषा नगरी नातिशोभते तत्र दृष्टान्त: ह्रदात् दहराद्गरुडेन उद्धृतपन्नगा उद्धृता: पन्नगा: यस्या: सा आपगा नदीव एतेन \*रिपुसत्त्वे तद्गमनयोग्यात्वं सूचितम्\* \|"

  

Here what he means by रिपुसत्त्वे तद्गमनयोग्यात्वं सूचितम् ? Why would one find a river full of snakes enchanting...?

  

Please help.

  

dhanyavaada:

Srikanth.
