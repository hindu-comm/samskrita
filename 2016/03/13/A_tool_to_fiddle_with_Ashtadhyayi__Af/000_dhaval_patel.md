Respected scholars,  

We have been working with Sanskrit verb form derivation computationally.  

As a by-product of that work, we have developed a tool by which a student can visualize what effect would occur if a particular sUtra didn't exist in Panini's grammar.  

We think it would be of interest to some of you.  
  

Web page - <http://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/tiGanta.html>  

  

Example:  
![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/74289d4d87700/capture.png?part=0.2&view=1)  
  

Execution of code would go on as if sUtra number 8.3.15 (खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीयः) didn't exist in Paninian grammar and give the forms without this rule. This way we would be able to visualize the effect of absence of rule 8.3.15 on Paninian grammar.  
  

In the present case, it would be as follows  
![Inline image 2](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/74289d4d87700/capture.png?part=0.1&view=1)  
  

N.B. -  
1. You can silent multiple sUtras by passing a comma separated value e.g. 8.3.15,1.3.9  

2\. In future, we plan to generalize the tool so that the computer would list the rules barred by absence of a given rule and rules which apply additionally in absence of a given rule.
