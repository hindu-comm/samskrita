Respected sir,  

Thank you for your feedback.  

There were two coding errors in the segment you tested.  

1\. When adding the upasarga to the verb form, it had set $pada to 'pada' from 'pratyaya'. That is why there was wrong application of 'jhalAM jazo'nte'.  

2\. There was a space left in between wrongly which prevented application of 'iko yaNaci' to generate 'vya....'.  
  

Both the errors have been corrected in this commit - <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/commit/b9c68ffba015e3e425721127409f90f02d6ea2fb>.  

The issue discussion was lodged at - <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues/663>.  
  

The code on live server is updated for the correction now. Press F5 to remove any old cache.  
(N.B. Now there is an option to derive Nijanta forms too - in beta mode for testing).
