Sri Vidyasagar seems to have taken varsha in bhaarata varsha to be a word for the English nation.



Since the English word 'nation' is a modern word it can not have a Sanskrit word in ancient usages. raashTra is being used as the Sanskrit equivalent of the English 'nation', as part of modern Sanskrit usage.



Varsha of bhaarata varsha is a geographical word, used in ancient Sanskrit literature, no longer relevant for a contemporary use in modern Sanskrit usage.
