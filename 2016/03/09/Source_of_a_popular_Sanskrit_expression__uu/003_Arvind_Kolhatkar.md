Perhaps there may not be any old source - such as a classical work, a scripture - for the popular expressionसंस्कृतिः संस्कृताश्रिता. It could be modern creation of the last 100-150 years.

  

I say so because the sense in which the word संस्कृति is now employed - culture, civilization. सभ्यता in Hindi, is not met anywhere in the old literature. MW lists the word 'संस्कृति' but shows its meaning as 'making ready, preparation, perfection'. He does not even hint at 'culture, civilization', the sense more familiar to us now.

  

(This reminds me of another frequently-met discussion about the source of 'जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी'. This topic has been discussed in this Group on several occasions.
