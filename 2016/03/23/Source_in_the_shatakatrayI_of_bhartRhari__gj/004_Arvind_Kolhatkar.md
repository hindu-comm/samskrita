Thank you Dr Raghavendra Bhat. The English translation I have shown is much shorter than the verse you quote but the sense is the same. I understand that the translation quoted by me is from 'Bhartrihari, Poems' by the late Dr Barbara Stoler Miller. I wonder whether Dr HN BHat has the same verse in mind or does he know of another verse having the same sense.

  

The same verse appears at 94/116 in Subhashitasarasangraha, where its source is shown as verse no 48 in DD Kosambi's critical edition of Bhartrihari's subhashitas. It appears as one among Bhartrihari's subhashitas, but with different different numberings in several other places. (As no 57 in Dr Heverlin's Anthology of Kavyas printed 1847 in Calcutta, no 101 in Wikiquote, no 98 in the blog of our friend GSS Murthy etc.)

  

My query has been sufficiently satisfied by what I got through this exchange.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
