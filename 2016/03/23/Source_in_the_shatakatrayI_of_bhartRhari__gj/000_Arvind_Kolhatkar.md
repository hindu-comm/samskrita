Dear Group,

  

In a paper that I am reading the following is said to be the translation of a verse of भर्तृहरि. I checked through all the three शतकs but could not identify any verse which would translate as follows:

  

Vanquish enemies at arms...

Gain mastery of the sciences

And varied arts...

You may do all this, but karma's force

Alone prevents what is not destined

And compels what is to be.

  

Could any scholar in this Group guide me to the verse in theशतकत्रयी of which this is the translation? If it is not theशतकत्रयी, any other source?

  

Thanks in advance...

  

Arvind Kolhatkar
