Prabha,

  

If you are happy with a free digital version, several, with English/Sanskrit commentaries, are available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). A good digital copy of Dr Heverlin's Anthology, printed in 1847 in Calcutta[, is available at books.google.](https://books.google.ca/books?id=jntFAQAAMAAJ) (This one has the additional bonus as it also gives several other well-known Kavyas, such as Meghadoota, Ritusamhara, Cautapancashika, Amarushataka, Mohamudgara etc.

  

DD Kosambi's book appears to be available only as hard copy and you will have to purchase it from one of the online sellers.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
