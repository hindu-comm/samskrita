हरि: ऊँ

  

Here's an attempt and happy to learn/corrected from the teachers in this group:

  

The प्रत्यय that comes from the विधि of a शब्द, if that शब्दस्वरूप is in the beginning and the प्रत्यय is after, then that शब्दस्वरूप is calledअङ्ग ।

  

Example:

भू + मिप् 

and

भव + मि (intermediate step to भवामि formation)

and

राम + सु

  

In all 3 examples, भू and भव and राम areअङ्संज्ञक ।  
  
धन्यवाद,  
Sanju
