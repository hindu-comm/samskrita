# INTERPRETINGSHUKRANITIFOR CONTEMPORARY PRACTICES IN LEADERSHIPANDMANAGEMENT

# ACall for Contributions to an Edited Volume

**Chapter Proposals due:**March 31, 2016

**Tentative publication date**: Summer 2017



### Introduction

Theory as well as practice of Business Management has acknowledged the importance of ‘Glocalization’ – thinking global, while acting local. It has also remained an eclectic approach where knowledge from diverse fields has been transferred in an on-going exercise. 

While there are several arguments over whether the Western thought and practices should be transplanted, adapted, merged or subservient to the local context, the reverse trend also exists. Theories and practices, especially in the areas of leadership, stress management, individual well-being and happiness from a number of origins the world over have been integrated with main-stream thought. From the perspective of paradoxical thinking or organizational ambidexterity, it is possible to conceptualize this challenge as that involving a leader’s and manager’s attempt to balance between the so-called mainstream as well as non-mainstream theory and practice in order to enhance the organizational and individual effectiveness.

  

Although what constitutes ‘non-mainstream’ represents different contexts, the repository of knowledge within the classical Indian scripture has been globally studied and adapted. ‘Niti’ or policy directives or guidelines are among the writings that are meant to guide action towards desirable ends and means. These writings are fascinating and many of them are relevant even today.

  

Traditionally, as the classical Indian texts were rarely dated, scholarly discourse is available to those who wish to develop a better understanding of the period during which those texts might have been written. Niti writings are also subject to similar estimations, and they are available, generally speaking, from the time of Mahabharata of which Vidura Niti is a part, to Shukra Niti which was written, according to some, in the post-Vedic and post-classical era in around 14^(th)century AD.

  

For those who are interested in exploring what constituted the principles guiding leadership and managerial practices at a time of transition from mythological age to historical age,ShukraNitipresents a useful reference. It upholds the classical belief system at a time apparently when the people from other continents had already arrived, and when gunpowder was already in use.

  

However, two major challenges confront those who wish to exploreShukraNiti.

  

1.Context-appropriate re-interpretation of classical terms such as Niti itself. The other such frequently used terms are Dharma, Tapas and Yagya.

2.Thematic presentation of Shukra Niti based on re-organization of more than two thousand shlokas of the text.

SinceShukraNiti, like many other texts, is written in Sanskrit, one practical challenge is that the scholars who understand the language and the text, may not have expertise in the field of leadership and management as taught in most degree courses and MBA programs around the world and vice versa.

  

In sum, the motivating question here is, “How can interpretation, extension and application of Shukra Niti benefit the current leadership and management theory and practices?”

## Recommended Themes

Contributions from scholars and practitioners are invited, addressing but not limiting to the following themes:

  

·Leaders, Managers and governance: rethinking guidelines meant for the king

·Other concepts (as selected by the contributors)

·    Leadership prerequisites: knowledge essential for a king  

·Qualities of a good king: what modern leaders and managers can use

·What a king should and should not do: lessons for effective leadership behavior

·Developing the leaders of future: reinterpreting guidelines for princes
