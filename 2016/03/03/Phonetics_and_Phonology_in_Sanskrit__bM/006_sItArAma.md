Do not divert the topic by saying English does not have Anunasika etc. My question was not about what English has, it was about your preference. "You said - I prefer dot free write as you pronounce non lengthy worded Sanskrit."

  

What if another guy has a problem with ञ and start advocating that पञ्चshould be written asपंचand the list can go on.

If there was no need for that sound, then it would not have been there to begin with.

I am sure you must have heard the saying "ardha-***matra***-***laghavena*** putrotsavam manyante vaiyakaranah"

  

If everybody's personal preference was accounted for it would become something else like Hindi, Gujarati, Bangali, Marathi asthey all share devanagari Sanskrit alphabets in some form.

Youhave thefreedom to create your own but don't call it Sanskrit.
व्याख्यानतो विशेष-प्रतिपत्ति: न तु संदेहात् लक्षणं - try to learn Sanskrit in its original form and do not contaminate with your personal preferences.

  

I do not say my personal preference is pronounce Calm as काल्म्, Know as क्नो etc, every language has set rules and one must learn it by respecting those rules.
