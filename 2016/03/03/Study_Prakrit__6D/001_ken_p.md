Ashokan edicts are the oldest inscriptions found in India. They are in Shauraseni Prakrit, and written in the Brahmi script...................  

  

One may see in the link how many Brahmi letters resemble to current Roman script.May be westerners were able to modify Brahmi script to their proper use the way Cyrillic writers did with Roman script. We need more research in this area.

Since most languages are taught to others in Roman script we are heading back to the simplicity of old Brahmi script which our earlier pundits failed to modify.
