Study Prakrit

  

<http://www.navelgazing.net/2016/03/study-prakrit.html>

  

Prakrits are the oldest languages known to mankind. As per the ancient Sanskrit adage, ‘prakrityaa bhavam praakritam’ {Prakrit is that which came into being naturally}.

  

Ashokan edicts are the oldest inscriptions found in India. They are in Shauraseni Prakrit, and written in the Brahmi script.

  

Prakrit was a fluid language and existed in many forms:

-   शौरसेनी Shauraseni - was spoken in and around the ancient kingdom of
    Shurasena (Mathura). It serves as the reference point for most
    Prakrit grammarians.

-   पाली Pali - was spoken in the Eastern region of the Gangetic plains

-   पैशाची Paishachi - was spoken in the Bahlika regions such as Punjab,
    Sind, Baluchistan, Quetta, Afghanistan and other parts of Asia lying
    to the North-West of India

-   मागधी Magadhi - was spoken in the Magadha region

-   अर्धमागधी Ardhamagadhi - was spoken in the Western region of the
    Gangetic plains

-   महाराष्ट्री Maharashtri - sophisticated later form of Prakrit, was
    spoken in the Western region of the Deccan plateau, preferred by
    Prakrit poets because of its innate elegance

-   अपभ्रंश Apabhramsha - last form of Prakrit, was spoken in Northern
    India. It metamorphosed into Khadi Boli, Braj, Avadhi, Bundeli,
    Dhundari, etc.

  

Prakrit

is an important part of the rich linguistic tapestry of ancient and classical India. A great deal of secular as well as religious literature has been written in Prakrit.

  

Unfortunately, not many university departments in India and abroad teach Prakrit. As a consequence, Prakrit is restricted largely to learned Jain renunciants and a handful of lay scholars. They learn Prakrit through the teacher-pupil tradition. Also, there exist some ancient and medieval texts describing Prakrit grammar in great detail. But they have all been written in Sanskrit! Unless you know Sanskrit, you will not be able to use them to learn Prakrit.

  

Prakrit is used by the Jain community in their daily worship rituals. Hence, the need for an organised and easy to read textbook for learning Prakrit.

  

Fortunately, there are several books available now, for learning Prakrit either through Hindi or through English.

  

We stock several well organised and thoughtfully created self study books for those who would like to study Prakrit on their own. The Prakrit learning books use short, easy to grasp lessons to teach students the orthography, consonants, various conjunctions, nouns, pronouns, tenses, genders, conjugations, transitive and intransitive verbs, active voice, passive voice, suffixes, cases, etc. which form the crux of Prakrit syntax. Prakrit is a case-driven language and thorough study of its grammar shall enable the student to be able to read and enjoy the sublime beauty of Prakrit literature.

  

We are proud to recommend these books to all those who love mother India and her rich and ancient linguistic and cultural heritage.
