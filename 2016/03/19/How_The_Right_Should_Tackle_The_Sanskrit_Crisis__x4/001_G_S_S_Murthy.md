I believe we are obsessed with Leftists, Rightists and centrists. We are all brandists. All belong to the brand:If you do not agree with me you are an ---ist.I do not think that is the way we should look at.

Let there be criticisms galore. Let there be churning. Amrit will finally come out of it. आ नो भद्रा क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः.

Regards,

Murthy
