Instead of closing eyes and being poetic in every such discussion, people are choosing to accept reality and do some work. If you are such a believer that you could think that nothing ever goes wrong, then please spare these people who are struggling; even their struggle will not yield any bad. In that case, it will be better if you could keep your non-istic view intact and don't disturb them. In a way you are taking a position yourself and branding these struggling people as brand-lovers.

If you are not one of them, you should not take a stand anyway.
