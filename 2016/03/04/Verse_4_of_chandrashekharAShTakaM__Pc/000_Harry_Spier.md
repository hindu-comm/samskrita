Dear list members,  

  

The version of the candraśekharāṣṭakaṁ I've seen has verse 4 as:

मत्तवारणमुख्यचर्मकृतोत्तरीयमनोहरं  
पङ्कजासनपद्मलोचनपूजिताङ्घ्रिसरोरुहम्।  
देवसिन्धुतरङ्गसीकरसिक्तशुभ्रजटाधरं  
चन्द्रशेखर चन्द्रशेखर चन्द्रशेखर रक्ष माम्॥ ४॥  
mattavāraṇamukhyacarmakṛtottarīyamanoharaṁ  
paṅkajāsanapadmalocanapūjitāṅghrisaroruham \|  
devasindhutaraṅgasīkarasiktaśubhrajaṭādharaṁ  
candraśekhara candraśekhara candraśekhara rakṣa mām \|\| 4\|\|

  

But its been suggested to me that there is a variation of this hymn that has the first word of line 2 verse 4 as paṅkajānana

If any of the list members have books of stotras that have this hymn in it, it would be very useful to me if they could give me the name of the hymn book and its editor and which version of candraśekharāṣṭakaṁ the hymn book contains, the version with verse 4 line 2 beginning with paṅkajāsana or the version with verse 4 line 2 beginning with paṅkajānana .

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
