Dear friends,  
Chanakya font has been used to typeset most of the Hindi and Sanskrit books for very long time. For example, all NCERT books have Chanakya font (or a similar, Walkman Chanakya) for देवनागरी. An year ago I made a Unicode font using the same glyphs. Although it does not have all characters of Unicode Devanagari, it can be used to type almost everything that could be done using the original Chanakya font, and some more conjuncts are rendered properly.  
  
You can use it in PDFs or in printing. I don't suggest using it for any other purpose, like Web, because I am not sure it will render properly on all systems.  
  
**Legal issues:** The original Chanakya font was a copyright of Macromedia, which is perhaps now taken over by Adobe but I don't think they sell it any more. I did not take any permission form anyone and modified the font for my own needs. I am giving it here so that you can use it, too, on your own risk.  
  
उज्ज्वलः।
