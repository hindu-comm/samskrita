Dear Ujjwal Rajput Ji

  

You may have good intentions, but please, STOP!

  

This is not only a violation of copyright laws and the user agreement of Chanakya fonts but also disrespectful towards the designers of Summit Infotech who have designed, maintained, and improved this beautiful font over years. Designing one single conjunct glyph requires the patience of a god, what to speak of hundreds of glyphs used in a Devanagari font.

  

For those who want to use this font in Unicode, Summit Infotech offers a product called Indica Unicode. It is reasonably priced at Rs. 5000 and comes with 40 odd Unicode fonts which can be used on a single machine. The forty fonts inluce ChanakyaPro and ChanakyaUni which are the Unicode versions of the legacy Chanakya font. The fonts come in four styles (normal, boldface, italic, bold italic) and work with most application software programs like Word, Excel, Pagemaker, Corel, InDesign. An exception is LaTeX, which requires open fonts (in TTF format, see [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/279251/use-a-font-that-is-temporarily-loaded-in-memory-on-windows)), while Indica Unicode comes with encrypted fonts.

  

For Rs. 5000 you not only get 40 Unicode fonts in four styles (effectively 160 fonts), but if you detect any problem with a glyph, their design team promptly fixes it and sends you the updated encrypted font. This is from my personal experience.
