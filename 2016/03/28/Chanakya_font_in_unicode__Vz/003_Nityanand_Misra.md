Here are sample pages of a Hindi book typeset by me using two Unicode fonts: ChanakyaPro (and Charis SIL at some places). Three styles (normal, bold, and bold italic) are used on the front cover, and all four styles (normal, bold, italic, and bold italic) are used in the book. While ChanakyaPro does not have as many conjunct glyphs as Sanskrit 2003 or Siddhanta, the four styles make it a clear winner for print publications over the other two.
