Acarya Siddhasena Divakara, a Jain ascetic accepted by both traditions of Jainism - the Digambaras and the Shvetambaras - as their own, lived in the early years of the Common Era. He was believed to be the teacher of King Vikramaditya, on whom the Vikrama Samvat calendar is based.

  

Acarya Siddhasena Divakara was a profound thinker and logician. One of his most important works, the SANMATI-TARKA occupies a place of honour amongst works on Indian philosophy and formal logic. It is the only Indian work on formal logic to be composed in Prakrit.

  

SANMATITARKA is a key Jain text for the exposition of syādvāda {doctrine of multi-sidedness}, anekāntavāda {the multiplicity of reality}, and the seven viewpoints, shedding light on the epistemology and ontology behind Jainism's syādvāda.

  

The original text was composed in 167 verses. It is accompanied by a Sanskrit gloss of 25000 verses composed by Acarya Abhayadeva who lived in the tenth century CE. And a modern Hindi commentary based on the original text and gloss, running into 75000 verses.

  

For the first time, this entire work has been made accessible to all through this exhaustive Hindi commentary composed by Acarya Jayasundara suri who spent over 31 years composing this extraordinarily detailed and elaborate Hindi commentary.

  

The text along with the commentary has been beautifully published in a set of 5 volumes. The set is printed on special quality lightweight paper which is expected to last over 500 years.

To give you a glimpse into this great work, here are selected verses:

  

jo heuvaayapakkhammi heuo aagame ya aagamio

so sasamayapannavao siddhantaviraahao anno

\~ Sanmati-Tarka, verse 3.45

One who accepts logic-based subjects on the basis of logic,

And accepts the authority of the scripture for scripture-based subjects,

Is a true proponent of the Jain scriptures.

One who acts different,

Is opposed to the Jain religion.

\>\>\>\>\>\<\<\<\<\<

jaha jaha bahussuo sammao ya sissaganasamparivudo ya

avinicchio ya samae taha taha siddhantapadiniio

\~ Sanmati-Tarka, verse 3.66

Despite being renowned for his scholarship,

Universally revered and with a large following,

If one fails to comprehend that the Jain doctrine

Is underpinned by the principle of many-sidedness,

One is opposed to the Jain religion.

\>\>\>\>\>\<\<\<\<\<

naanam kiriyaarahiyam kiriyaamittam ca do vi egantaa

\~ Sanmati-Tarka, verse 3.68

Knowledge without conduct,

And conduct without knowledge,

Both are one-sided and therefore incomplete.

Excerpts from the Preface by Gacchadhipati Acarya Bhuvanabhanu suri

“The publication of a Hindi commentary on the Sanmati-Tarka is like being offered ghevara (an extremely popular sweetmeat) in times of starvation! In this era, dominated by Western culture and education, there is a disinterest in the study of ancient Indian texts composed in Prakrit and Sanskrit. There are a few who are interested, but since they do not know Sanskrit and Prakrit, their desire to study Sanskrit, Prakrit and nyāya texts remains unfulfilled. Hence, for them, the publication of this text along with a Hindi translation is a delightful feast!

The learned Jain monk, Acarya Siddhasena Divakara, who taught King Vikrama, composed this text on the basis of anekāntavāda and syādvāda, and critiqued philosophies which were based on ekāntavāda. This text established the superiority of anekāntavāda. On the basis of this, the master logician Acarya Abhayadeva suri composed an excellent commentary which critically examined other philosophies as the pūrva paksha {prima facie view}, and presented the Jain doctrine as the uttara paksha {refutation and conclusion}. This was done in such an organised and cogent manner, that any student of nyāya {formal logic} would do well to read his commentary in order to understand presentation of facts and dissemination of logic in a purely neutral and academic manner. Not only this, Abhayadeva’s commentary offers a clear and rational understanding of other belief systems as well as Jainism.

As one proceeds in reading this great text, one’s delusions fall away and the Jain doctrine appears in all its clarity. Samyak darshana {rational perception} is attained, and extant samyak darshana is purified. As we know, purity of perception leads to purity of conduct. Hence, in the Nishitha Curni, it is said that reading and studying deeply the Sanmatitarka is vitally important.

This text is a fine purifier of thoughts and sheds the light of truth upon the universe. Hence, it is a supreme treasure of this era, to be revered and studied. Hence, those who desire liberation should study it thoroughly and contemplate upon it repeatedly. May the writer of this Hindi commentary carry out similar work on other Jain texts as well.”
