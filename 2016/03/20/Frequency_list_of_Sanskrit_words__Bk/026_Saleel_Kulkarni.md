Dear Shri. Anunad Singh,



This is an important task that you have successfully carried out. Thank you.



You said :

{{I took 2000 most frequent Sanskrit words each from about 15 books (Ramayan, Kumarasambhavam, Hitopadesh, Amarushatak, Buddhacharita, Chhandogya upanishad, Dhanurveda, Kaamsuutra, Kavyalankar, Krishiparashara, Manusmriti, Nyayasutra, Rasahridayatantra, Samkhyakarika, Tarkasangraha, Yogasutra etc) and computed a cumulativefrequencylist.}}



This is an important piece of information vis-a-vis the Frequency List. I think you should put up this list also beside the Frequency List.
