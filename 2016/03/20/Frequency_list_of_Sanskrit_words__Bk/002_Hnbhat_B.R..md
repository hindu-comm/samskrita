It is all there. But he is asking whether there is a list of words that are frequently used and of the 3000 roots, a list of frequently used ones. Not all the words in the dictionaries and grammar are used.

For example,

वृन्दारका दैवतानि पुंसि वा देवताः स्त्रियाम् ।। १.१.१८ ।।

Amara says the word दैवत is used in neuter and masculine gender also. But it is never used in masculine gender.

Of the verbs, हन हिंसागत्योः the root is used in the two senses, to kill and motion. But it is never seen in the second sense as रामो गङ्गां हन्ति meaning Rama goes to the river Ganga.

Not all the nouns in Ganapatha are used and many are used very rarely.
