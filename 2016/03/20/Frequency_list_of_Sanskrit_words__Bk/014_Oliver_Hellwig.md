Dear all,  
  
You could also use the DCS overview for single texts:  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=corpus>  
  
Click on the "F" in the last column of the table to get those roots for single texts. When you choose the Mbh or Ramayana, you may get a good starting point for compiling such a list.  
  
Oliver
