Nityanand ji,  
  
It did not require me to use any code. The following site, suggested by Shri  
Oliver Hellwig, directly gives the frequency list of up to 2000 words.  
   
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=corpus>  
  

One has to click at F (last column) corresponding to any book to get the frequency list of that book. I only had to change the IAST to Devanagari and compute the cumulative frequency which I did with help of LibreOfice Calc.
