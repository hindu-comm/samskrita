While we wait for something to be compiled, there is a list already that can be used. The writers state:

  

The list of words is a compilation from various sources such as messages on sanskrit-digest, translated documents such as Bhagavadgita, atharvashiirshha, raamarakshaa et cetera, and other files accessible on the web.
