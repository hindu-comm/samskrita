I took 2000 most frequent Sanskrit words each from about 15 books (Ramayan, Kumarasambhavam, Hitopadesh, Amarushatak, Buddhacharita, Chhandogya upanishad, Dhanurveda, Kaamsuutra, Kavyalankar, Krishiparashara, Manusmriti, Nyayasutra, Rasahridayatantra, Samkhyakarika, Tarkasangraha, Yogasutra etc) and computed a cumulative frequency list.  
  

The resulting file is attached.
