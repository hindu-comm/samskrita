I found multiple authors in the mails sent by GSS Murty. I deduced it from a word frequency analysis of his varied mails! I, however didn't go looking for multiple authors!

Isn't it elementary that word frequency changes with the subject being discussed?

What if suppose the multiple authors were conscious enough to fox any future frequency analysts? Would they magically become one? Or will you conclude that actually they were 1568 in number, but they were intelligent enough to fox the best frequency analysts.
