अनुनाद महोदय

  

I understand that you have asked for most frequently used संस्कृत word list which I too would like to have, but I have amaturely (being trying to compile a list of exact opposite. ) i.e most frequently used words in english or other languages and their translation to संस्कृत । My motivation and plan to learn, like small children, is to use संस्कृत for daily practical conversation before I graduate to reading short stories.

  

I am attaching two lists which I have made. If the scholars on this forum find it useful, these can be expanded upon with their help. Please keep in mind that these lists are still a work in progress and moreover I am a neophyte and through स्वाध्याय have just started learning सः तौ ते therefore these lists are incomplete and bound to be full of mistakes. I would be indebted if corrections are sent.

P.S - To reduce the size from more than 10 Mb, the verb list consists of images.
