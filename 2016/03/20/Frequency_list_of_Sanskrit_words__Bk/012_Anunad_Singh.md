वीरेन्द्र महोदय,  
  

To create a 'word-frequency list' in exact sense requires that the list be made by counting word-frequencies in a selected corpus.  
  

But we know that there are not one but many such lists for English and other languages because selection of the corpus can make considerable difference. Keeping in view this practical fact that such a list can not be unique, the procedure followed by you can also be used in part for this list. I propose the following method for creating such a list of most frequently used Sanskrit words-  
  

Suppose we want to create a list of 2000 most frequently used Sanskrit words. Let us take about 3000 most frequently used English words. I feel that about half of these will have Sanskrit equivalents which might be most frequently used Sanskrit words. These have to be sorted out by experienced Sanskrit scholars. Add to this sorted list some Sanskrit words which are known to be used frequently but not occurring in the list. This list, though not created by counting, may be as useful as one created using the exact method. But much of the work in this procedure will have to be done manually and it will add an element of subjectivity in the output (ie the list) too.  
  
Today Sanskrit text of various types is available in digital form in abundance. Frequency analysis softwares are also available easily. But we need to do Sandhi-vichchheda for Sanskrit corpus before words can be counted. This can be a problem, though I know that some Sanskrit text is also available where Sandhis have been undone.
