Dear Prof Rao,

Yes, it was typographical error and I have already apologised. Actually I got interested in this word by referred to it at WAVES conference in November last year, seeking analogy with rashmi and UshmA, abovetypographical error occurred.

  

  

Of interest is its dual meaning.. kAl \~ death, time.

Implications to be the declaration:

  

"I am death" by Shri Krishna in BG

  

"I am Time", where "I" is Brahm.

  

Thanks for care.  

Regards

Sati Shankar
