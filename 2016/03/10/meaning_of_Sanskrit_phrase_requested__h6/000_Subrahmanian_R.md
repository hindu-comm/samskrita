In a signboard of ASI (Archealogical Survey of India) I saw the following words, apparently the motto of ASI.  
प्रल कीतिमपावृणु. I could not find these words in the web site of the ASI nor from dictionary or google. अपावृणु appears like 'to uncover' etc. I am eager to know the meaning of ASI's motto.
