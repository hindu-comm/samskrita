Nityanand,

  

  Either there are such combinations of those two Devanagari characters to be found in any written/printed works, or there are not.

  

It occurs to me that you introduced the qualifying neologism 'Paninian form', as a retroactive defense for the sin of non-detecting that other pair.

  

  

Non-appearance is impossible to prove.

Ulrich Stiehl, where are you, please. We don't have $64 to spend on a big book when all we want is two little letters.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers
