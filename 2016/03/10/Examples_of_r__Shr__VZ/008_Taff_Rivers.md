     The issue is **A***dvanced search on Monier Williams,* etc.

  

Searching through a text of 10 million or so unicode characters for occurrence a pair of letters, as two distinct glyphs (shapes) or as a single glyph (ligiture) is not an easy task.

  

There is the *search,* and there is the ***result*** of the search.

  

Search techniques vary in theirthoroughness.

It is in the interest of all of us, to know the relative effectiveness of such search tools.

  

Your *prefix* and *infix,* suggests that you limited your searching to Koeln's online system.

and that you did so via a PC device, rather than via the more limited Mobile mode.

  

Did you try using the *substring* parameter?

*  
*

**Most importantly *How did you switch on the non-existent* *Paninian-form parameter?***

  

Also, in order to dismiss the occurrence of those letters in the entry for'ajuṣran', on the grounds that it is *non-Paninian,* you would have had to locate that entry in the first place, would you not?

If my reasoning is unsound, please advise me that I may improve it.

  

And for everybody's benefit, please reveal how you did your searching that we all may benefit.

  

  Regards,
