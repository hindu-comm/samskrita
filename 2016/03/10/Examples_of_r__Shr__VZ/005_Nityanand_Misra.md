Hello Taff,

  

Are you implying that a form in RV would be non-Paninian *because*the Rgveda predates Panini? If so, then I disagree with the reasoning.

  

RV surely has many forms which are Paninian. In addition, Panini does account for many usages in the Ashtadhyayi which are valid only in the Vedic texts but not in Laukika.

  

So just that a usage is found in RV does not mean it is non-Paninian.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
