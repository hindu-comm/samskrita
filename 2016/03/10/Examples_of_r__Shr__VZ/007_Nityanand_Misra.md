Dear Taff

  

I do not know what you are talking about. Neither is 'Paninian/non-Paninian' a neologism, nor did I introduce it as any retroactive defense of any sin (whatever that means). I only stated a fact about the form *ajuṣran*, and expressed a likelihood thatthe conjunct may not occur in Paninian system.

Not always in the Paninian system, since it is quite mathematical. E.g. "sca" cannot occur in the Paninian system, since it will change to "śca" by "stoḥ ścunā ścuḥ".

  

Similarly, if it can be shown that there is no root which has the combination‘ṣr’ to begin with, and no rule which can result in ‘r’ after ‘ṣ’ (e.g. no rule introducing the augment रुट्), it may be possible to prove that the conjunct does not occur in Paninian forms in Laukika. Vedic is different as there are many vyatyayas and bahulam rules.
