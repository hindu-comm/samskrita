Nityanand,

  

 To follow up.

  

Digital versions of the early hand- written Rig Veda manuscripts are hard to find!

  

AndUlrich Stiehl went commercial with his work over a decade ago, he is not answering an email re the matter.

His book is $64. So I guess its a $64 dollar question.  

  

 I did locate one other ‘ṣr’in the MW, albeit an‘rṣr’ purportedly in a German work by a Grassmann. but again...

  

Taff

  

  Keoln's on-line versions don't seem to do substring searches very well.

 I use a local customised MW, and my own search algorithms (having first obtained official permission to use the MW, for private use).
