I searched here using prefix and infix

Did I say I used such a parameter in my search? I used my knowledge of grammar to conclude it is a a non-Paninian form. The commentary by Sayana confirms it.

You are misinterpreting me. I did not dismiss the occurrence of the glyph. I am not sure what gave that impression, but I certainly did not. I simply said the form is non-Paninian. Saying that a usage is non-Paninian or *arsha*is not the same as non-existent. I edited a 400-page book on non-Paninian forms with over 1000 footnotes and none of the 750 odd non-Paninian forms were *dismissed*, they were all *explained*.

  

May I suggest you please read up what these terms mean before you conclude anything. The attached paper by George Cardona is a good start.

  

Thank you once again for pointing me to the form in RV.

  

I hope there are no more confusions at your end.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
