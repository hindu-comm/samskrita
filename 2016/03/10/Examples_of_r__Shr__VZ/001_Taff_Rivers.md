Nityanand,

  

 Actually, there is a single such an occurrence in the MW.

  

  It is to be found within the body of the definition for 1. juṣ in column 1 of page 424.

  

  viz.

    • 3. pl. ajuṣran, i, 71, 1.

  

   where the ref. is to the RV:

  

  

  upa̱ pra ji̍nvannuśa̱tīru̱śanta̱ṁ pati̱ṁ na nitya̱ṁ jana̍ya̱ḥ sanī̍ḻāḥ \|

  svasā̍ra̱ḥ śyāvī̱maru̍ṣīm**ajuṣrañ**ci̱tramu̱cchantī̍mu̱ṣasa̱ṁ na gāva̍ḥ \|\| 1.071.01

  

  

  As to how the consonants are actually rendered in original manuscript(s),

  requires further research...  

  

  

Taff,


