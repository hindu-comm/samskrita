Dear list  

  

In Ulrich Stiehl’s list of 807 conjuncts attested in Sanskrit, the two-consonant conjunct‘ṣr’ (ष्र्) is listed as the 786^(th)entry (third from left in last line of page 4 of<http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/mathe.pdf>).  

  

I have been unable to trace any word in which this conjunct would occur in Sanskrit.

  

Prefix and infix expression on Advanced search on Monier Williams, Vācaspatyam, and Śabdakalpadrumaḥ yielded no result (except forक्ष्रौम् in M-W which has the three-syllable conjunct*k**ṣr*)

  

Does anybody know of an example of a word or verse/sentence in which the usage of this conjunct is attested?

  

Thanks, Nityanand
