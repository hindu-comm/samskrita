Dear All,

  

Around 25 years back I learnedmanual typing on Hindi/Devnagari Keyboard. In the computerization age when different keyboardswere being developed, I was looking the same layout which I learned. Today that layout I think is equal to CBI keyboard. Up toWin-7 I was using "Hindi Indic Input 2" software to use that keyboard but unfortunately, that keyboard is not supported on Win10.

  

Does anybody in the group know any freeware software for Win10 which can provide me CBI keyboard layout? That would be the great help.

  

Warm Regards

Hari
