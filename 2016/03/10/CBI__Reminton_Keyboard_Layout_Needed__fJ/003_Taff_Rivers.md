Hari,

  

 The problem is probably due to an AV, over zealously reporting false positives.

  

I have three layers of same, including Kaspersky's Internet Suite, and nothing gets quarantined.

  

  

I did have installation problems thought, In my case, Administrator privileges were required.

  

  

This is what I get \[Trial Version\]

  

   "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hindi English Typing Tool\\Hindi English Typing Tool Win 8.exe"  

  

   from the their download "Hindi Indic Input 3 32-Bit.zip"

  

  and this on my 64 bit machine

  

  

They have a contact address on their site.

  

  

Another route to take, is to realise that a keyboard is just a keyboard, the keys themselves are removable and replaceable, as is the software (drivers) that come with them.

  

Good luck,

  

 Taff
