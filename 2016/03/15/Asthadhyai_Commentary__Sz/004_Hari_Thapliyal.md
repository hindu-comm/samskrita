Dear Ms. Ken, Sh. Sitaram Ji,

  

I heard in my childhood that if you ask with your earnest heart from the god then gods gives you more than what you want.

  

But many a time this forum proved like this for me. I ask for something it understands what may me useful for me and what I may be struggling through and gives me much more than what I deserve.

  

In Sanskrit grammar, I am a new boy but you matured people have made the journey very easy.

  

Thank you so much, Panini Guru, for creating such a followers.

  

Thank you so much, Mr. Ken and Sitaram Ji.

  

Warm Regards

Hari
