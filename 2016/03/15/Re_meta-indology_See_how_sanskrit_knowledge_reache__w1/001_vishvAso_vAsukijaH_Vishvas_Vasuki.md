This is not necessarily a bad thing - some foreign scholars are benign. A good cop/ bad cop (= साम+दण्ड / carrot and stick) strategy is better than just using one component of the response. Some work they do is useful for us too - we should encourage win-win cases. Consider this, for example -<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbw7iA8zQwQ&list=PL63uIhJxWbggtEJTjsgLTrlUFVnGMvNUA&index=7> . No nepAli bothered to produce such a video, but the foreigner did. Everyone wins.
