I'm very sorry that email was sent somehow before it was composed correctly.  

Here is a new where Odisha Govt is shamelessly accepting that the number of Manuscripts in it's specific repository has decreased from about 40000 to less than 20000 within 2 years.  

Definitely these people are selling those important documents for money. That's illegal.  
  

Same is the condition of Manuscript library of Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University, Darbhanga.  
  

Incompetent and corrupt persons serving in those institutes should be punished by law. Any step which scholars can take collectively?
