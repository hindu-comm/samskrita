hariH OM,

  
" 2. s'oka-->s'loka etymology is not valid and does not appear to be suggested, seems to be s'abdasoundarya (word-play, ifone prefers)"  

We can observe in rāmāyaṇa, brāhmaṇa-like or upaniṣat-like nirvacanas to padas,  
skanna -> skanda.  
asura and sura because of not having and having drunk suraa.

1\. Hence śoka->śloka can be taken in this spirit and we can choose not be too finicky about "etymology".  
2. If we don't do this, we will also have to enlarge the scope of looking for word play in other granthas and call hṛdi + ayam = hṛdayam of chāndōgya and so also the many nirvacanas that we come across in brāhmaṇas and upaniṣats and nirukta as mere word play.  
3. If item 2 is what you meant (enlarging the scope of looking for word play), then we will reach the same conclusions of the early European "scholars" about Veda / Śāstra.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
