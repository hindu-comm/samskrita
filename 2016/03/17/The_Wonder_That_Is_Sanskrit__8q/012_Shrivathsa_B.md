hariH OM,  
HN varya, with prostrations at your feet,

 If we don't accept shoka -> shloka, we will have to reject skanna -> skanda malada, karuuSha, apsaras, sura, asura in rAmAyaNa and also other such nirvacanas in brAhmaNa granthas. Going back to my previous post will be to go full circle.

 This "style" of giving nirvacanas is found in brAhmaNas, either by way of connected words or by way of AkhyAyikAs. Just the way the prakRRiti pratyaya vibhaaga according to vyaakaraNa will be different from the nirvacanas found in brAhmaNas, it may not be fair to impose strict conditions of prakRRiti pratyaya vibhaaga on rAmAyaNa given that it is aarSha. Hence the requirement for shloka's dhAtu to meet the meaning of "shoka" will be unfair. Another example I wrote was ChAndogya's nirvacana of AtmA = hRRidi ayam = hRRidayam. One cannot say that because the nirvacana for AtmA comes from hRRidayam, there is no connection (prakRRiti pratyaya vibhaaga through hRRidayam will not lead to AtmA). But the connection is very much there, that is because the grantha is ArSha. When I had asked a vyaakaraNa scholar about the impossibility of deriving AtmA from hRRidayam, he told that this has to be taken as it is because the authority of a brAhmaNa grantha is higher than prakRRiti pratyaya vibhaaga.

 I am not justifying the blog. Even when this portion was included in our school curriculum, it was titled as "shokaH shlokatvamAgataH". Hence shoka -> shloka has been imprinted in my mind since about 20 years. I am able to see that it is justifiable.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
