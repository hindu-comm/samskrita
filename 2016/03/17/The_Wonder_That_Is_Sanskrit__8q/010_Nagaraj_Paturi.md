AadaraNIya Shrivatsaji,



1\. The word s'loka has many usages in Sanskrit, as in puNya s'loka and others. That should also be taken into account.



2\. All s'lokas are not s'oka related.



3\. In the cited Ramayana references, there is certainly attention being drawn towards the sound similarity between the two words. But there is no evidence there to indicate that a word origin explanation is intended there.



4\. Even in the cited commentary, it is not mentioned that the word s'loka is derived from the word s'oka.



5\. If I find a direct expression in Ramayana which mentions that the word s'loka is derived from the word s'oka, I shall certainly take that to be one of the alternative etymologies from a venerable source.
