हरिः‍ ॐ,  

भवच्चरणयुगलं प्रणम्य,  

  
 This was exactly the point of my previous post nAgarAja varya. There is an unmistakable brAhmaNa like touch to some parts of the bAlakANDa, specially in the instances of skanna -> skanda, and sura-asura, malada, karUSha etc. There has been an effort to connect the words. I don't understand as to how they cannot be phonologically connected (more below).  
  

 For the second part of your post, we can say that we have to infer and it will not be a baseless inference. please consider the following:  

शोकार्तस्य प्रवृत्तो मे श्लोको भवतु। न अन्यथा भवतु।  
 Although vAlmiiki would have known that any aShTAkSharapAda will become an anuShtup (because anuShtup is found in veda and as per tradition, vAlmiiki is later to veda), he didn't want to give the sAmAnya nAma anuShtup because of पादबद्धोक्षरसमः तन्त्रीलयसमन्वितः। This is the reason he says "न अन्यथा भवतु".  
  
Why go for the name "श्लोक"? Because  
(i) the words "मा निशाद..." were inspired by "शोक" (शोकार्तेनास्य शकुनेः किमिदं व्याहृतं मया).  

\(ii\) There could have been other bhAvas such as kopa etc. but shoka was dominating. There is an indication of this when vAlmiki says "अधर्मोयमिति द्विजः". अधर्मवेदित्व of the act and करुणवेदित्व can inspire many bhAvas, but only shoka came to him. This is the reason he doesn't say कोपेन प्रवृत्तो मे।  
(iii) the word श्लोक is close to शोक.  

\(iv\) श्लोको भवतु नान्यथा is an address to his shiShya bharadvAja as an answer to his own mental question "किमिदं‍ व्याहृतं मया?"  

\(v\) the words शोकार्तेन and शोकार्तस्य make the above inference unmistakable. Else, vAlmiiki could have just said: "पादबद्धोक्षरसमः तन्त्रीलयसमन्वितः प्रवृत्तो मे श्लोको भवतु नान्यथा. The word "शोकार्तस्य" is added in this sentence because he is explaining to bhAradvAja that it is shoka which led to "mA nishAda..." and therefore it is being called as shloka. Else, there is no need for a guru to explain to his shiShya.  

  

 If we don't conclude as above, the elegance of the narrative is lost. Commentators seem to make this connection:  
The govindarAjiiya says the following:  
"शोकार्तस्य क्रौञ्चीशोकेनार्तस्य मे प्रवृत्तो मत्तः प्रवृत्तो ऽयं सन्दर्भ इत्यर्थः । ..... श्लोको भवतु श्लोकलक्षणलक्षितत्वात् श्लोकशब्दवाच्यो भवतु । नान्यथा श्लोकादन्यः केवलपदसन्दर्भो न भवति इति मतिं चकारेति पूर्वेणान्वयः"  

  

 amRRitakataka says commenting on brahma's words:  
"मच्चित्तेनापि त्वया पारतन्त्र्यात् इदानीमपि शोकव्याजेन श्लोक एव बद्धः"  

  

 Again, in the skanda narrative, the object viz. naming of the child of shiva as skanda... out of many names which could have been considered, skanda was, that is because it is the closest to skanna. This is the style of brAhmaNas of specifying / explaining names. We have to accept it as part of our tradition.  
  

 Another example is the बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत् - अर्चते वै मे कमभूदिति तदेवार्कस्यार्कत्वम् . There are numerous such examples in brAhmaNa / AraNyaka (another top of the mind example is the nirvacana of gharma in aitareya brAhmaNa).  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
