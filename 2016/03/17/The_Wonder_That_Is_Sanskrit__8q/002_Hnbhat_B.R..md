As I have heard from poets, it is the first Shloka, i.e. in Laukia Chandas, and Shloka has started from Valmiki's first verse Maa Nishaada. Therefore he is considered as the आदिकवि and रामायण is आदिकाव्य. Whether this is true or false, I have not bothered about. I don't remember exact verses mentioning this.

  

  

Not that the word श्लोक isword "Sloka" derives from "Shoka" based on Valmiki's "maa nishaada' verse.
