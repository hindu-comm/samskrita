Why it is named श्लोक is explained in the commentaries. But no commentary says the word श्लोक is derived from शोक etymologically. Why should one guess wildly to justify the sentence "derived" in the blog mean? There is no hint in the verse itself that the word श्लोक is derived from the word शोक, as far as I can see through the commentaries.

"श्लोको यशसि पद्ये च" इति निघण्टुः ।। 1.2.18 ।।
