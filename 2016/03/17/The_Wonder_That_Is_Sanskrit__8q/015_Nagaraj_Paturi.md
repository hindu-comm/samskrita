There is a clear derivational expression in the following:



यस्मान्मा रुदतेत्येक्ता रुदन्तो गर्भसंस्थिताः।



मरुतो नाम ते नाम्ना भवन्तु मखभागिनः ॥ मत्स्य 7.62



Some other puranas give the narrative with clear derivational expressions.



Yaaska derives marut from ruch = to shine



We may now takeboth thederivations as two different kinds of venerable derivations.



There is no such clear derivational expression in the verses of Ramayana quoted fors'oka--> s'loka.



Hope this makes my view clearer.



Humbly,



Nagaraj
