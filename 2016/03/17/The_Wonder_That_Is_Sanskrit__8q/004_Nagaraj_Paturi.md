1\. This maa nishaada being first s'loka is legendary/mythical not historical.



2\. s'oka-->s'loka etymology is not valid and does not appear to be suggested, seems to be s'abdasoundarya (word-play, ifone prefers) is what is intended.



3\. Emotional (transcendental) experiencebursting out in a musical form has parallel to Veda-aavirbhaava.



4\. The narrative associated with this idea has content parallel to Ramayana content: separation of one of the members of a marital/love couple from the other and has suggestions for Karuna rasa being angirasa in Ramayana kaavya.
