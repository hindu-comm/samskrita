AadaraNIya Shrivatsaji,



The article says, " Have you wondered about the origin of the word shloka? "



It goes on to say, after a few lines, "Since the couplet was composed against the background of sorrowing, this couplet came to be known as shloka. So the Valmiki Ramayana tells us."



There is no verse in Valimiki Ramayana which means,



"Since the couplet was composed against the background of sorrowing, this couplet came to be known as shloka"



Regards,



Nagaraj
