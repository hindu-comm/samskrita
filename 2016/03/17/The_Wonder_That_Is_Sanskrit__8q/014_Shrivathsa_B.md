Enough evidence has been given to show why the claim of shoka -> shloka can be justified by considering it an ArSha nirvacana in line with brAhmaNas.

One example I had forgotten was that of maruts. They being named because of the story where Indra cuts diti's foetus into pieces. All the pieces start crying. Indra asks the pieces not to cry (maa rudaH) and hence the name marut.  
The prakRRiti pratyaya vibhaaga for marut according to vAcaspatyam is मृ उति. This isn't connected to maa or rudaH. But the nirvacana is valid because it comes from an ArSha grantha.

I don't know how seeing a pattern writ all over the bAlakANDaH is tantamount to attributing our understanding to maharShis. This is the metaphoric equivalent of shooting the messenger. On the contrary, denying the nirvacanas is tantamount to disrespect to them and their granthas.

 I wish to stop here with prostrations at your feet.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
