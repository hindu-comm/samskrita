Sure,

That .css was denoting that it was extension.

When you name some text file created in notepad++ (or any other notepad which supports programming languages) with extension, it changes extension. It recognizes that.

Built-in notepad is not a good tool.

  

And, many users never see extensions in their system, simply because Windows doesn't show it natively. You have to make changes in explorer settings to see the extension. Once you do that, then you can rename the file and change the extension, both.

  

If you felt problems, then I expect that most of Sanskrit knowing friends will face problems in applying this.

We may help them by guiding.
