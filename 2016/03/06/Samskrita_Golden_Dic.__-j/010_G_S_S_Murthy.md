Dear Shankaraji, Lalitalaalitji,

Now that Shankaraji has successfully followed-I could not- Lalitalaalitji's guidelines, could he please give me a tutorial in greater detail? I confess despite using a PC for long time my knowledge of Windows directory etc is abysmally low.

Thanks for the help,

Regards,

Murthy
