Namaste,

  

I am no expert in Sanskrit language, but based on what I have read from the Vedas with the help of translations, I understand that anyone who approaches Vedas expecting technical manuals would be disappointed. 

  

I understand that, they are instead, the unignorable source of \*values\* that should guide the search and development of science and technology. What constitutes relevant and valid science and technology changes over time. But perhaps, someone who pursues scientific research and development after studying relevant parts of the Vedas, they would have had nothing to lose, but so much of sensitive, poetic, pre-scientific inquisitiveness about the possibilities and directions. Nasadiya Sukta and Bhumi Sukta are cases in point.

  

Best wishes,

margie
