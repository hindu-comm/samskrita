\>I understand that anyone who approaches Vedas expecting technical manuals would be disappointed.



Yes, this probably means that expressions of disappointments, if there are any in this thread or elsewhere can come only from those who can be as naïve as to be able to look for technical manuals in the Vedas.



\>I understand that, they are instead, the unignorable source of \*values\* that should guide the search and development of science and technology.



This is also a very good point.



It is particularly from Environmental literature that we are getting new understandings that (a) Technology invented andemployed by a society is influenced by the worldview and values of the society. The presently employed environmentally harmful technology has been identified to be a product of a worldview and values that were anthropo-centric, nature-controloriented and nature-inimical.



It is in this literature that western society, western tradition and western values get highest blame.



Lynn White Jr, in the article "Roots of the ecological crisis" points out loss of pre-Christian animist traditions as the source. (Sharing the pdf here)

  

  

Contras this with the values in the Vedic tradition:

  

सहयज्ञाःप्रजाः सृ‍ष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।

अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥3\\-10॥

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥3\\-11॥

इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः ।

तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुंक्ते स्तेन एव सः ॥3\\-12॥

यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ।

भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ॥3\\-13॥

  

There is a description of eco-cycle and need to follow that in the verses following the above.

  

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः ।

यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञःकर्मसमुद्भवः ॥ 3\\-14॥

कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भव।न् विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम्। ।

तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यघ्Yए प्रतिष्ठितम्। ॥ 3\\-15॥

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।

अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥ 3\\-16॥

  

Thanks for inspiring me to share these views.
