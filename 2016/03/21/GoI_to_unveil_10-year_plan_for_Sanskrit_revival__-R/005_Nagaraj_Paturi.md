Dear Sri Sureshji,



Let the cynical doubting Thomases keep singing their old songs, while the day after day our Professors such as Prof. Vineet Chaitanyaji, Prof. Amba Kulkarniji and a host of such colleagues of us keep taking us forward revolutionizing fields such as computational linguistics using the hidden treasures from Panini and related Sanskrit sources leaving the cynics in their own paradise.
