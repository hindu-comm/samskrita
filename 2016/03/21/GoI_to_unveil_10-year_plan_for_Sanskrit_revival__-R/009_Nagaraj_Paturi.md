The late astrophysicist Carl Sagan (1980) noted that "the Hindu religion is the only one of the world’s great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of births and deaths. It is the only religion in which the time cycles correspond, no doubt by accident, to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang. And there are much longer time scales still."

**Abstract**

Ancient Hindu Texts indicate that cosmic processes are driven by two cycles: a Primary cycle possibly some 311 trillion years long that begins with the formation of the universe and ends with its dissolution and regeneration for a new cycle; and a Secondary cycle of 8.64 + 0.12 billion (Gy) years that begins with the formation of an Earth-like planet that supports life, or by extension the formation of a Solar system, its demise, and its rebirth. Using the history of the secondary cycles described in the Texts we deduce: 1) that our universe is at least, but not much older than 13.2 *+* 0.15 Gy, in excellent agreement with current scientific data; 2) that primeval planets formed within less than a billion years of the beginnings of the universe, in agreement with the observations of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope; and 3) show that the Texts predict the demise of the Earth in the next 4.2 Gy and describe the nature and sequence of events leading to its incineration that are remarkably similar to those inferred from current models of Solar evolution. The Secondary cycle and its history implies: 1) that our Solar System is the successor to a primeval parent that formed \< 0.7 Gy after the dawn of the universe; 2) that the Solar system has the capacity to essentially replicate itself approximately every 8.64 Gy; and 3) that human life may have existed on an Earth-like planet about 8.7 Gy ago. These results and implications, covering 18 Gy from the inception of the universe to the demise of the Earth, are independent of any and all scientific theories and religious speculation concerning the origins of the universe or how stars and planets formed; nor do they rest upon any uncertain interpretations of the Texts. Therefore, the cosmic cycles of Hindu cosmology (HC) are not products of fanciful imagination of ancient Hindus, but most probably have scientific underpinnings. The cyclic universe of HC fits well with the Cyclic Model of Steinhardt and Turok (2002, 2004); and the Sun’s capacity to replicate itself/planets can be explained in terms of the Solar Nebular Model and the evolution of the Sun through the red giant phase.

**Concluding Remarks**

The two major results of this study, if they survive the test of time and I have no reason to believe that they would not, will have major implications. The demonstration that ancient Hindu seers may have unraveled some of the mysteries of the universe begs the question: How did they do it without the technological assets that modern science possesses? The finding that the Sun apparently replicates itself periodically is profoundly important for the understanding of cosmic processes and for the evolution of life and its distant fate. Lastly, the conclusion that the event that took place some 13.7 Gy ago marking the onset of the (current) universe was a seminal event irrespective of whether the universe is conceived to be cyclical or one that began with a bang may turn out to be equally important in reconciling conceptual differences between competing models of the universe.
