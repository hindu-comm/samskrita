Dear Sri Sureshji,



Please go through this pdf  
<http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/108/04/0471.pdf>which was already discussed in another list.



Samples from the same:



The third controversy concerns plastic surgery, which  
seems to have been driven in several parts of the world  
by the need to repair broken noses (apparently an ancient  
and common punishment worldwide), cleft lips, etc. The  
first records go back to Egypt in 3000–2500 BCE. In the  
6th century BCE, Suśruta consolidated Indic ayurvedic  
knowledge in an encyclopaedic and foundational text  
called the Suśruta Samhita. This included the practice of  
plastic surgery, in which India clearly remained well  
ahead of the rest of the world. Thus the first major rhinoplasty  
in modern West was performed as late as 1815 by  
a British surgeon who had served in India for 20 years,  
and was triggered by British press reports about how  
Maratha soldiers who had lost their noses in the Anglo-  
Mysore wars were surgically set right in Pune. There was  
no European competition to so-called ‘Indian Nose’, so  
Indic claims on plastic surgery seem to be on solid  
ground.

Finally, a few words about Indic mathematics, which I  
consider has not yet gained the global or domestic recognition  
it deserves. Apart from the well-known numeral  
system, and the algorithmic/computational revolution  
it sparked, the number of advances made in India long  
before they were (re-)discovered in Europe keeps increasing  
as we learn more of our own history. Look at these  
examples: a large part of algebra, first solutions to linear  
and quadratic indeterminate equations (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta);  
the binomial theorem, the combinatorial formula  
and Pascal’s triangle (Pingala 3rd century); second-order  
interpolation formulas and the Newton–Raphson  
method (Brahmagupta), the Fibonacci numbers (Virahanka  
700 CE, Hemachandra \~1150 CE); the basics of  
differentials, maxima of functions, mean value theorem,  
etc. (Bhaskara \~12th century, Munjala \~ 800 CE); infinite  
series, and a precursor of what later came to be known as  
calculus and analysis (Madhava 14th century): so the list  
goes on. These contributions are not just ‘little’ mathematics,  
and the ‘big picture’ of their collective influence  
on the world was succinctly and accurately summarized  
by Hermann Weyl when he wrote (Preface to The Theory  
of Groups and Quantum Mechanics, 1928):
