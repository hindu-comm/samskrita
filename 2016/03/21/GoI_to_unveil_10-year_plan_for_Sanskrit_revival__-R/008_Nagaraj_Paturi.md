The concluding remarks of the essay are:



The above review indicates that there is growing evidence to suggest that ancient Indian metallurgists have also made major contributions which deserve their place in the metallurgical history of the world along with other great civilizations of the world. As clearly seen in the case of zinc and high-carbon steel, ancient India contributed significantly to their modern metallurgical advances and in the development of metallurgical study leading to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and hence deserve a special niche in the annals of western science. In this Golden Jubilee year of the department it is worth recalling the achievements of the past as a source of inspiration and confidence for future generation of metallurgists in India and elsewhere. Prof. Cyril Stanley Smith has remarked that usually man assays metals. Metal can just as well be used to assay the progress of mankind. In this assay the ancient civilisation of India acquits itself with glory.
