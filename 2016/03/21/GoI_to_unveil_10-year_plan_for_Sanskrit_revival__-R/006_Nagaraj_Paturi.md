One of my friends has completed interesting computational music projects which make a computer give concerts on its own (not synthesized by the user) using the methods of analysis of music provided in our Sanskrit works on musicology only.



His name is Prof. Vinod Vodwans, works as Dean of School of Fine and Performing Arts at the FLAME School of Liberal Education, Pune.
