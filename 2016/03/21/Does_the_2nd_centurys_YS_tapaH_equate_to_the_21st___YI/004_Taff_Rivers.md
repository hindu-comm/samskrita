Yogi,

  

 Indeed, as you say, the underlying thread running right through the YS, from 1st verse to last, is abstraction.

Changing consciousness from outermost to innermost states of mind.

I haven't actuallythought to count and enumerate all those successive though.Thanks for the idea!

  

As to your other observation - the dependency of the results on ones previous lives.

  

Given that we have no access to those previous lives, the only practical course of action to take is to get started on abstracting, and find out the hard way!

  

As one who has actually got to that state and come back again, in this mortal life, I am still not privy to any previous lives.

I can only deduce from my experience that knowledge of previous lives is irrelevant.

  

If I may comment on the many torturous attempts by commentators to explain the term *cittavṛtti*,which is after all the sole objective of the YS,

  

modifications of mind stuff etc.

  

mind stuff! That is to be understood in the same terms as the ether was in the early days of radio waves.

Sound travels courtesy of the air stuff, radio waves must need some stuff too, mustn't they, so let's call it ether while we search for the stuff.

We can point the finger at a certain J.H.Woods for not doing his homework on that one.

I have been obliged to do that homework and discovered that our ancestors had reasoned by the same logic,namely that thoughts also needed stuff to travel through. It's there in the Nyāya's.

  

As for modifications! *Vṛttis.* They are flows, as in streams, of that aforementioned mind stuff, that citta.

  

So into the term, citta, As used by the author it is clearly defined - by that same Author, that we should understand which specific sense of it that he is using.

He introduces his work with the term. YS I. 2.

He signs off with that term n the very last verse. YS IV. 34

  

I do not think that is accidental, I think that author new exactly what he was doing, which was **instructing** not philosophysing.

  

Everyone of his statements readily manifest the hallmark or context of an instruction, do they not?

A simple investigation into to the cohesiveness of the treatise, readily reveals this.

  

Again, have you noticed that the YS and its ongoing stream of commentaries is categorized by the world of international booksellers (the ISBN system) as 'philosopy'

even the the Author(s) himself on the very first line of the very first Pada, i.e. the title line, descriptively says Instruction.

Viz. anuśāsana.**instruction .**Which is one of the very few Sanskrit words that have not acquired, layers of meanings and connotations,

Agian, I do not think that was a coincidence either.

  

  

The whole idea is to stem that flow, stop that that drain on mental energy, To harness it, that we have recourse to it as and when we need it.

This mental power. like any sort of power, is just that, power. Defined as the ability to do. Note, only the*ability* to do.

Putting it to use, if ever, is another matter. Power that is never used, just stands there.

Such is the essential nature of *power*.

The particular power in question though, is ever flowing, powering up the thinking machine non-stop. And its just as well that it does!

The idea then, is to harness this inbuilt *śakti* of ours so that we direct it for a change, not the other way around, which is the unruly native state which we are born with.

  

That's hard work though. One day I'll have to get down to it, one day...

I am a long way from being a saint!

  

More generally, that realization that I speak of occurs under ideal conditions while sitting on ones bottom.

  

To obtain and maintain that condition while walking around the supermarkets in search of good value for my coffee money, or to know the recent past in order to understand were I put my presently invisible car keys is another matter.

One day...

  

Perhaps Mr Murthy as well as Mr Yogi have something to say as advisors to the government in connection with their long term,10 year plans for Sanskrit.

  

But seriously...
