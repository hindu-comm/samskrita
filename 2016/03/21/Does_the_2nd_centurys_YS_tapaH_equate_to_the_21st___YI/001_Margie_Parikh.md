... I am not sure if people have seen the before-during-after fMRI of people for altered brain structures, but in recent past I completed an online course on Edx, titled "The Science of Happiness" offered by professors of UC Berkeley. They presented interesting evidence that people who are more empathetic, people who are into mindfulness (=dhyan), people who give, etc hare less stressed, are happier, etc. They also said that mindfulness alters brain structure.

  

They surely seemed averse to naming any religious terms and phenomena. Perhaps you should volunteer for them - could be interesting.
