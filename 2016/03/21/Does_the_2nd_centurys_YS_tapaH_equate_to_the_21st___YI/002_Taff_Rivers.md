Margie et al,

  

 What I seek is *information*, first hand accounts from those that have achieved full realization of the 'self', i.e. the state of 'pure consciousness'.

  

Accounts not of happenstance as from such as NDE's - as from being revived after drowning or heart surgery, but through inducing it themselves.

\- by creating the circumstances that allow for the results to appear.

  

Many are the survivors of the NDE experience, that live to tell the tale, and describe their experiences in their own words.

Such descriptions are numerous and easy to come by.

  

Though it is true, that media sources, that enumerate those personal experiences, take, shall we say a 'popular' approach, adding a sense of the mysterious by speculating to whom, or what may be responsible for it, divine or mundane.

  

So as ***to bridge two of the causes*** (the Yoga Sutra enumerates five), and unless nicotine and caffeine, count as 'medicinal herbs', only one of which I can speak of from personal experience.

  

The matter of the OBE/ disembodiment, can nowadays, be readily and repeatedly induced in healthy subjects, irrespective of religious or cultural backgrounds.

While the induced state, in my own experience, also had the 'OBE' characteristic, though not so much as an 'Out of Body Experience' as a 'disembodied' one.

  

Innumerable indeed, are the 'scriptures' (i.e. written works), not only from the East and West, but also from the North and the South, that testify to the existence of such a state,

But there is only the one, that I am aware of, that actually details the mean(s) by which anyone, anywhere and any time can actually realize that state or his or her self.

  

It is of course the Yoga Sutra.

  

And the best place to search for first-hand accounts of such experiences? The Indian continent, perhaps.

Not so. Those that have embarked on such missions tell of their surprise and disappointment to discover not a one, much hearsay, much trekking to those heard of places, but nothing...

The only beneficiaries appear to be book publishers and the tourist trade, and good luck to them too.

  

To clarify: I seek not *suggestions* as to where such may be found, but forums/websites or even printed material, containing *actual occurrences* of first-hand narrations.



As to relief from stress, happiness,current fashions that is mindfulness for etc. I am neither stressed, nor unhappy.

  

What I am though is thirsty, for knowledge.

Though such an experiencer of that knowledge of the hereafter, whereby 'nothing remains to be known' ,

I am fortunately, still resident in the here-before, whereby I continue to pursue mundane knowledge, such as a where to get best value for my coffee money.

  

Seriously, any pointers, guys?

Mindfulness: 'Take a deep breath, count to ten':, that will be $29.99 please.

Yoga Sutra:  'Take a deep breath, repeat': that will be 20 minutes, as you please.
