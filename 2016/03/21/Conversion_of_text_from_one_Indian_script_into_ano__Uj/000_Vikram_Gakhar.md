Sometimes a piece of Sanskrit text is available in one Indian script and we want to read it in another script. If the text is in ASCII format then here's a low-tech method to convert it into another ASCII Indian script. The steps listed in the attached file are for conversion from Kannada to Devanagari, but should work in principle between any two Indian scripts.  
  

If anyone knows of a better method, please share. I am sure it would be a no-brainer for software people to write a script.
