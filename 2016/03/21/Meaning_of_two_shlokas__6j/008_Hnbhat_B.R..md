Sorry. I did not notice your remark on भ्रूलतां. Your anvaya identifying Krishna with रतिजानिः is not correct. रतिजानिः = Kamadeva is the subject of the verb अजयत् and रुग्मिणीशः is the subject of पातु in the main clause. Still for correct Anvaya, I would prefer विधाय instead of निधाय. That is why I requested to check again.

The anvaya between the main clause and relative clause will be as following with the correction:

यस्य सौन्दर्यवल्लीकुसुमवत् अभिरामं दशनमुखदृगोष्ठं पञ्चबाणान् भ्रूलतां धनुरपि विधाय बल्लवीनां निवहम् अजयत्, असौ रुग्मिणीशः अस्मान् पातु।

And strict translation would be,

Making five arrows in the form of dents, face, two eyes and lips beautiful as the flower of the creeper of beauty of whom and creeper of brows as bow, Kamadeva conquered the crowd of cowherd girls, let that lord of Rugmini protect us.

Sorry for the omission.
