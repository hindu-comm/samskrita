namaste,

  

A few thoughts to continue the discussion (not in the sense of विद्वांस एव प्रमाणम् :-))

  

For the first sloka, the version I found reads "रतिजानिर्भ्रूलतानां". In some traditions, Krishna is identified as Kamadeva. I wonder if the anvaya is the following, though I'm not happy with the placement of भ्रूलतां.

  

यस्य दशनमुखदृगोष्ठं सौन्दर्यवल्लीकुसुमवत् अभिरामं, \[सः\] रतिजानिः पञ्चबाणान् भ्रूलतां धनुः अपि निधाय बल्लवीनां निवहम् अजयत्। असौ रुग्मिणीशः अस्मान् पातु।

  

For the second sloka, the version I found reads शिवविरिञ्चरमावरार्च्यः, though I don't know how to make sense of that.

  

Forसुधानिधिललामजटाजलौघम्, I think this is a reference to Ganga in Shiva's matted locks, in the sense of सुधानिधिः (चन्द्रः) तेन ललामभूता अलङ्कारभूता जटा, तस्याः जलौघः. i.e, he produced the waters that reside in the matted locks adorned by the moon.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
