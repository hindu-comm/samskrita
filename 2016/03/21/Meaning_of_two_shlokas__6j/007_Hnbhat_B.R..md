This is correct reading.

As I can make meaning, शिवविरिञ्चरमावरार्च्यः it means worshipped by trinity - Shiva, Virinchi = brahma and ramavara = Vishnu शिवविरिञ्चरमावरैः अर्च्यः refers to विष्णोः पादः.  
  

\> Forसुधानिधिललामजटाजलौघम्, I think this is a reference to Ganga in Shiva's matted locks, in the sense of सुधानिधिः (चन्द्रः) तेन ललामभूता अलङ्कारभूता जटा, तस्याः जलौघः. i.e, he produced the waters that reside in the matted locks adorned by the moon.

Here also स refers to विष्णोः पादः as Ganga is born from the feet of Vishnu.

Pradyumnacharya did not check for correctness in spite of my second request and was happy with the explanation provided already. Hence I remained silent.

Thanks for providing correct version.
