Taff,  

Here is the link to keyboard that I am used to <https://ubcsanskrit.ca/keyboards.html>  

I am also attaching letters it can produce with just option and corresponding one letter combination. There are many empty space where I can assign different devanagari letter. I am working on Ubuntu on MacBook Pro.  

Shift + X produces क्ष.  

I agree we would need lot more keys to get all combination but क्ष त्र ज्ञ are taught as letters in Hindi. thats why I wanted to have a key for them instead of typing क ् ष all the time.
