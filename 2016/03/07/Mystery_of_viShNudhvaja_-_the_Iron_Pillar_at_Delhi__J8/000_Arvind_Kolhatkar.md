An article by FitzEdward Hall, with the heading 'Three Sanskrit Inscriptions' may be seen at the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 31, Nos I-V, 1862 at p.111. The following appears in a footnote to the article ’At Bhelsa, within the fort, I recently found a fragmentary inscription, built into the outer wall of a modern house, and looking upon one of the streets of the town. Subjoined is all that remains of a record of which perhaps a full half is missing:' He thereafter proceeds to reproduce in Devanagari the 10 lines of that Sanskrit text. Line 5 thereof is 'भाइल्लस्वामिनामा रविरवतु भुव: स्वामिनं कृष्णराजम्।' (May the Sun God Bhaillaswami protect the King Krishnaraja.) This Krishnaraja, an obscure king in those regions, does not much concern us here. What is significant is that this line records the existence of a temple to the Sun, called Bhaillaswami, that once stood in the precincts of Vidisha. The temple does not exist there anymore and has been totally forgotten.



Sultan Iltmash, upon hearing of the wealth of the temples of the Ujjayini-Vidisha-Malwa area, had, in 1234, fallen upon them and had looted and demolished many of them, including the Mahakal Temple of Ujjayini. A description of this campaign of destruction, recorded by the contemporary Muslim historian Minhaj-us-Shiraz in his history called 'Tabkat-i-Nasiri' may be seen in 'History of India as Told by Its Own Historians V. II', collected by HM Elliot. P. 328 thereof says the following:



“...he sent, in A.H. 632 (1234 AD), the army of Islam towards Malwa and took the fort and city of Bhilsa. There was a temple there which was three hundred years in building. It was about one hundred and five gaz high. He demolished it. From thence he proceeded to Ujjain, where there was a temple of Mahakal, which he destroyed as well as the image of Bikramijít, who was king of Ujjain, and reigned 1316 years before this time. The Hindu era dates from his reign. Some other images cast in copper were carried with the stone image of Mahakal to Dehli."



A translation of the same 'Tabkat-i-Nasiri' was also made by HG Raverty. The following is found on p 628 of it regarding the expedition against Ujjayini.

  

"(Conquering) Ujjain-Nagari and bringing away of the idol of Maha-kal, which they have planted before the gateway of the Jami Masjid in the capital city of Delhi in order that all true believers might tread upon it."



These extracts testify to the existence of a large and ancient temple at Vidisha. It was destroyed in the Itmush's campaign of the year 1234 and all traces of its memory have now been lost.



Research in modern times indicate that the Udayagiri Hill was being used from times before Chandragupta II for making observations of heavenly bodies. On the Southern eminence of Udayagiri Cunnigham has noted the existence of the ruins of a building, as also of fragments of a broken pillar. He says on p.56 of the 'Report of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa, 1874-75 & 1876-77' (Archaeological Survey of India Reports Vol 10):



“On the top of the bill there are traces of buildings in several places. Immediately over the caves there is a large square platform beside which I found the bell capital of a large pillar surmounted by a lion. On the northern half of the hill, which is about 350 feet high, I found a piece of the circular shaft of the pillar, 9 feet 9 inches in length, with a diameter lessening from 2 feet 8 1/2 inches to 2 feet 7 inches. A short distance above this spot stands the massive end of the shaft, 2 feet 11 inches square, and 6 feet 5 inches long. This is still resting on the original site, but fallen towards the west. Apparently this was one of the great Lion Pillars of the Buddhists, which had stood for centuries on the top of the hill - a noble landmark to the country for many miles around. Then came the spoiler to carry it off, who dug down to its foundations and attempted to pull it down; but the pillar snapped just above the square end, where it struck the rocky edge of the excavation; the round shaft was broken into pieces and rolled down the. slope, while the Lion Capital was hurled to a distance and mutilated by its fall. In this broken state the pillar was not worth removing and the pieces remained where they fell.”



Till 1920 the broken Lion Capital remained where it had fallen, as shown below. Around 1930 it was shifted to theArchaeologicalMuseum located inthe Gwalior Fort, where it can be seen till today. Below are shown pictures of the fallen Lion Capitol as it now is in the Museum and as it found fallen to the ground. Some animal figures can be seen on the abacus - round strip - below the Lion. We shall return to these later.
A more careful observation of the recent days suggests that the forgotten Bhaillaswami Temple would have stood on this eminence.

In 1913-14 a survey and excavation on the northern eminence of the Udayagiri was carried out under the direction of Devdatta Ramkrishna Bhandarkar. Both Cunningham and Bhandarkar had hoped that, as in Sanchi, Buddhist remains would be found on Udayagiri but none were found. Instead, a pillar half buried and broken in two parts was found along with a broken part of a wheel with female figures carved on it, as also a Lion Capitol with four lions facing four directions and the round abacus below it. These apparently had rolled down and rested in front of Cave No 19. The Lion Capitol and the broken part of round abacus were carried to the Gwalior Museum. Below are shown pictures of the broken pillar and of the broken part of a wheel with female figures carved on it as these were found, as also of the Lion Capitol with four lions facing four directions and the round abacus below it as these were found. Lastly is shown the same Lion Capitol in the Gwalior Museum and close-ups of the abacus below it.

Surmises have been advanced as to the meaning of the images of animals on the tow capitols. The animals on the abacus of the single-lion capitol represent the six seasons. Those on the abacus of the four-lion capitol represent signs of the Zodiac with the Sun God appearing next to each sign. A closer look at these enable identification of the signs of Taurus वृषभ, Gemini मिथुन, Cancer कर्क, Leo सिंह, Sagittarius धनु, Capricorn मकर and Aquarius कुंभ.  



The city of Ujjayini, located at 23.17 N latitude, almost falls on the Tropic of Cancer and so does the Udayagiri at 23.53 N latitude. The name of Ujjayini was well-known to ancient Hindu astronomers. From Vedic times the Sun-God and Vishnu have been closely associated. It is believed that Vishnu, in the form of the Sun, traverses the world in three steps as sun-rise, mid-day and sun-set. The presence of the carved images of Vishnu and Varaha on Udayagiri, the now-demolished temple to the Sun-God on it, carved images of Rashis discovered there and the fact that Udayagiri almost stands on the Tropic of Cancer suggest the use of Udayagiri as the site on an ancient observatory.



As explained earlier, the north and south eminences of Udayagiri are separated by a long and narrow depression, at the western end of which stands the Anantashayana Cave. The depression is almost perfectly aligned with the Tropic of Cancer as seen in the line drawings shown below. In all places located on the latitude 23.5 N, the sun rises on the day of the summer solstice at a point 23.5 degrees to the north of the true east, at mid-day it is directly overhead casting no shadow and sets at a point 23.5 degrees to the north of the true west.
Thisspecialtyof Udayagiri must have been noticed by the knowledgeable Hindu astronomers because the northern wall of the depression issmoothly carved, leaving no projections on it to cast a shadow. The Anantashayana Cave stands at the western end of that depression. If a gnomon (शंकु) is placed at the eastern extremity of the depression, its shadow at the moment of the surmise will fall in the depression and extend towards the feet of Anantashayana Vishnu. It is thus a fair conjecture to make that the Standard of Vishnu in the form of the Iron Pillar - विष्णुध्वज - must have been erected at that spot. All this will become clear by looking at the following pictures - two line drawings of the depression, its two photos from its two ends as also pictures showing the positions of the Sun in the morning, at noon and at sunset from any point on the Tropic of Cancer, obtained from [this website](http://astro.unl.edu/naap/motion3/animations/sunmotions.swf).
