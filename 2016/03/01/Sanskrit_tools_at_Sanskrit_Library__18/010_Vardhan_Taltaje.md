Hari,  
  
You may try the 'Sanskrit Morphological Analyser' site at <http://tdil-dc.in/san/morph/index_dit.html>.  
  
I tested the first two words that you have given and here is what I got:  
  
For मनसा it gave:  
मनसा=मनस्{नपुं}{3;एक}  
मनसा{स्त्री}{1;एक} .  
  
It did not give anything for पर्युपासते. But when I tried for उपासते it gave:  
  
उपासते=उपासत्{पुं}{4;एक}  
उपासत्{नपुं}{4;एक}  
उप_आस्1{कर्तरि;लट्;प्र;बहु;आत्मनेपदी;आसँ;अदादिः}
