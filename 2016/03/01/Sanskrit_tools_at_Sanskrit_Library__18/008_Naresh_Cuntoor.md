Like you suspected - you're not using it correctly. Sanskrit dictionaries are useful if you can learn to search for the praatipadika or dhaatu of a word. Instead of what you searched for, you should be looking for manas etc. Instead of the verb forms, you could search for its lyuT forms to get the meaning.

In other words, I think it's best to study the basics from a teacher.
