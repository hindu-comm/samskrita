I am forwarding the message by Peter Scharf (who is not a member of this group), President of Sanskrit Library regarding your observation:

Dear Sanskrita list members,

I would like to comment on a recent posting that asserts thatThe Sanskrit Library phonetic encoding is missing two "Devanagari vowels".
Let me clarify a few concepts. The Unicode encoding of Devanagari script includes characters used in many languages. These characters represent vowels in different languages, Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, etc.
Unicode in general encodes writing systems, i.e. scripts, not languages. In sharp contrast to this, the Sanskrit Library Phonetic basic (SLP1) encodes the sounds of the Sanskrit language, not graphic characters in any specific script. The encoding therefore includes only Sanskrit vowels and consonants; it does not include vowels present only in English loanwords into Hindi. Therefore it is not "missing" any vowels; it excludes them from it's scope. It similarly excludes from its scope all the consonants represented by characters with the nukta sign. For an exposition of the principles of encoding both graphic and phonetic, please refer to Scharf and Hyman, Linguistic Issues in encoding Sanskrit available at the following link:

  

<http://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html>

  

If someone would like to design an encoding scheme that includes all the graphic signs in Devanagari, they are welcome to. But perhaps it would be more profitable to design an intelligent input method for Unicode Devanagari instead, since the idea seems to be to mimic what already exists in the Unicode Devanagari script chart.

Yours,

Peter
