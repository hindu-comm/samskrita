Hello Taff Rivers,  
  
I guess, you had selected समासच्छेदः with the input शोचितुमर्हसि.  

If you select पदच्छेदः then you will get the desired split.  
  

The current splitter has been trained on two different sets:  

a\) set of compounds with its components  

b\) set of sandhied words  
  

If a sandhied words has a compound joined with another word, this tool may not work properly.  
  

For more sophisticated tool, you may use the Heritage engine: <http://sanskrit.inria.fr>
