Thank you Amba Ji. I do not know what is the problem but website is not very very slow.

  

Although I got lots of help but in my original mean was something like below.

  

शोचितुमर्हसि =शोचितुम् (तुमुन प्रत्यया of धातु ??? ) + अर्हसि (लट् लकार मध्यम पुरुष एकवचन - धातु अर्) \[I think this dhaatu is wrong?\]  

  

So if I type some Devnagari Pada I come to know what type of Pada it is (Pratipadika, Noun, Verb, Adjective etc) How it is formed and related word formation.

  

Warm Regards

Hari
