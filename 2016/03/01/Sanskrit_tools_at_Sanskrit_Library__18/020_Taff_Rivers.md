Prof,

  

 Would you be the same Amba Kulkarni co-author of the*Discourse Analysis of Sanskrit texts*?

  

 I find the process of discourse analysis very revealing, as it reads what lies between the lines, to arrive at the *inside story,*as it were.

  

The lost art of discourse analysis re-emerging from the mists of time perhaps:  

  

 śabdārthapratyayānām itaretarādhyāsāt saṃkaras tatpravibhāgasaṃyamāt sarvabhūtarutajñānam  YS. //3.17//

  

  
Thank you again.  
  
 Taff Rivers
