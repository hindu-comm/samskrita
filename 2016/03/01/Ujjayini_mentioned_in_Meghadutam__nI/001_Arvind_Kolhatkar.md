Not only this single verse. Kalidasa devotes full 10 verses from No 31, to the description of Ujjayini, its wealth of markets, its Shipra River, old tales of Ujjayini, the temple of Mahakala. Before that, verses 24 to 26 are devoted to Vidisha and the DasharNa country around it. He even refers to the Udayagiri Caves that lie on the low hill - नीचैराख्य गिरि is the name by which Kalidasa describes it - to the west of Vidisha/Bhilsa. The rock-cut caves on it - शिलावेश्म of Kalidasa - are very much a tourist attraction today.

  

From the attention that this area gets from Kalidasa, one may say with some confidence that he lived in this area. However, the 'nine gems' story only has tradition behind it and little else.

  

In a day or two, I shall make a posting about the surmise of some scholars and the epigraphical reasons adduce to say that the Iron Pillar in the Kutub Minar Complex in Delhi originally stood at the Udayagiri Caves. Therein I shall also give my surmise as to how, in later days, the old name of Vidisha changed later to Bhilsa - since restored back to Vidisha.
