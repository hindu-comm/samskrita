Hi Ken

  

Thanks for sharing the link to the SOE version of my book (an annotated and expanded translation with multiple appendices).

  

It is better to use the links of the Flash version which I had shared on this group in [this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/JRuJw-Z5mlw/1ViZ4jjbBAAJ) message.

  

A downloadable PDF version of the sample pages is available from<http://npsbooks.com/upload/2015_NM_HCM_sample.pdf>

  

Thanks, Nityanand
