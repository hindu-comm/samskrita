(Continued from'Mystery of विष्णुध्वज - the Iron Pillar at Delhi - Part 1'

  

The famous Sanchi Stupa, the Garudadhwaja of Heliodorus at Besnagar, the historic city of Vidisha and the Dasharna country specially mentioned by Kalidasa in Meghadoota - all these places lie within a compass of 8 to 10 km from the Udayagiri Hill, as it is currently known. It is not far from Ujjayini, the capital city of Chandragupta II. (This Udayagiri should not be confused with another Udayagiri near Bhuvaneshwar, Orissa, which has the Hathigumpha Cave in its complex of caves.) As a hill, it is not very high. Its high point may not be more than 300 or 350 feet above the surrounding farm land. Rivers Bes and Betwa - Kalidasa's VetravatI - flow along its western and eastern flanks respectively and join together at its northern tip, flowing after that as Betwa, which eventually joins the Yamuna. The Udayagiri Hill lies approximately in a north-south orientation. Its north half is higher than the south half, with a depression separating the two. Rock-cut caves knows as Udayagiri caves lie in and around this depression. Their first modern mention is found in Gen. Alexander Cunningham's 'Bhilsa Topes' published in 1854.
('Tope' was a word much used in colonial times. It is a corruption of the Sanskrit 'stoopa' and Prakrit 'Thupo') Cunnigham visited the area in 1850-51 and has briefly described the Udayagiri Caves. Many scholars have, in later days, visited the caves and written about them.
Cunningham himself described them in more detail in the 'ArchaeologicalSurvey of India Report, Vol X, 1874-75 and 1876-77 at pp 45-56. The present Vidisha township - Bhilsa in the pre-independence days - lies 2-3 km to the east of the hill. Vidisha of the Gupta days was on the confluence of the Bes and Betwa rivers but, due to the threat of floods, shifted to the present location in the intermediate time.
The hill has 20 rock-cut caves as seen in the schematic drawing below.
Of these some are in the Shaiva tradition, some in the Vaishnava tradition and the rest in the Jain tradition.Archaeologicalremains dating further back to the Shunga period are seen on the north and south heights of the hill.

Of these caves, Nos 5 and 13, respectively knows as Varaha and Anantashayana Caves deserve special attention. The pictures show their interiors:

Below is the watercolor drawing of the Varaha cave, drawn by Charles Wade Crump:

In the Varaha Cave is seen mighty Vishnu, in the Varaha Avatara,lifting the earth out of the ocean and holding her up on his tusks. The Anantashayana Cave shows Vishnu reclining on the bed formed by the Shesha Naga. In both pictures two devotees are seen sitting at the feet of the deities and offering a payer.



Another cave, No 7 (the so-called Tawa Cave) has the following inscription of Veerasena, a minister of Chandragupta. (Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III, - Texts and Translations Part - p.34)



सिद्धम्। यदन्तर्ज्योतिरर्काभमुर्व्यां --------चन्द्रगुप्ताख्यमद्भुतम्

विक्रमावक्रयक्रीता दास्यन्यग्भूतपार्थिवा------मन: संरक्तधर्मा-----

तस्यराजाधिराजर्षेरचिन्त्यो------र्मन: अन्वयप्राप्तसाचिव्यो व्यापृत: सन्धिविग्रह: ।

कौत्सशाब इति ख्यातो वीरसेन: कुलाख्यया शब्दार्थन्यायलोकज्ञ: कवि: पाटलिपुत्रक: ।

कृत्स्नपृथ्वीजयार्थेन राज्ञा---संगत: भक्त्या भगवत: शम्भोर्गृहमेतमकारयत् \|

(The dotted lines indicate broken or worn-out text.)



I translate the available portion as:



Born in the Kautsa Gotra, learned, native of Pataliputra, Veerasena Shaba, appointed by family tradition Minister of War and Peace of Chandragupta who is bright like the Sun and awe-inspiring, came here with the King, who had set out to conquer the world and he caused this house of Lord Shambhu to be created.



This inscription shows that Chandragupta himself had come here with his minister Veerasena Shaba in attendance. That fact and also the known devotion of Chandragupta towards Vishnu strongly suggest that the two devotees, sitting at the feet of Varaha and Anantashayana are Chandragupta himself and someone close to him, perhaps Veerasena Shaba.
It is also possible that Chandragupta sitting at Vishnu's feet gave the name 'Vishnupadagiri' to this hill in Chandragupta's time. How the name might have changed to Udayagiri will be seen later.



These caves probably date back to Chandragupta's time around 400 AD, since they appear to have a personal connection with him. In another cave nearby, No 7, is the following partially damaged inscription. The area called 'Sanakanika' therein is mentioned in the Allahabad inscription referred to above as being ruled by Samudragupta along with 'Malava'. This inscription reads as follows:



सिद्धम्। संवत्सरे ८२ आषाढमासशुक्लैकादस्यां परमभट्टारक महाराजाधिराज श्री चन्द्रगुप्त ----- पादानुध्यातस्य महाराज चगलिगपौत्रस्य महाराज विष्णुदासपुत्रस्य सनकानिकस्य महा...।



Translation: Chandragupta's vassal (name lost) who is the ruler of Sanakanika and the grandson of Chagalika and son of Vishnudas, on Ashadha shukla 11 in the 82 year of (Gupta) Samvatsara (made the donation of this cave.)



Alberuni, a later traveler to India, has mentioned that there was a difference of 241 years between the Shaka and the Gupta eras. Thus the Gupta era can be said to start in 318-319 AD. ('History of Guptas' by R.N.Dandekar, pp10-15) therefore the year in which Cave No 6 was donated would be 402 AD. It has been calculated that Shukla 11, Ashadha would fall on June 26. (No 9 below) That this date is close to the summer solstice day of 21 June is significant, as will be seen later on.



Kalidasa knew this hill as ’नीचै:’ and he also knew of the rock-cut - शिलावेश्म - caves there. In his times the hill was probably not known as Udayagiri, otherwise he would have called it by that name. Its name in the local dialect would have been something like ’छोटी डोंगरी’ and Kalidasa changed it to ’नीचै:’. The Dasharna country, Vetravati river, the ’नीचै:’ hill and the caves in it are described by him in Meghaoota as under:



पाण्डुच्छायोपवनवृतय: केतकै: सूचिभिन्नै:।

नीडारम्भैर्गृहबलिभुजामाकुलग्रामचैत्या: ।

त्वय्यासन्ने परिणतफलश्यामजम्बूवनान्ता:।

संपत्स्यन्ते कतिपयदिनस्थायिहंसा दशार्णा: ॥२४॥

तेषां दिक्षु प्रथितविदिशालक्षणां राजधानीम्।

गत्वा सद्य: फलमविकलं कामुकत्वस्य लब्धा ।

तीरोपान्तस्तनितसुभगं पास्यसि स्वादु यस्मात्।

सभ्रूभङ्गं मुखमिव पयो वेत्रवत्याश्चलोर्मि ॥२५॥

नीचैराख्यं गिरिमधिवसेस्तत्र विश्रामहेतो:।

त्वत्संपर्कात्पुलकितमिव प्रौढपुष्पै: कदम्बै: ।

य: पण्यस्त्रीरतिपरिमलोद्गारिभिर्नागराणाम्।

उद्दामानि प्रथयति शिलावेश्मभिर्यौवनानि ॥२६॥



My translation:

The Dasharna country, whose gardens are looking whitish being covered as they are by sharp Ketaki flowers, the trees of whose villages are crowded by crows occupied in starting to build their nests, whose forests are full of ripening Jambu trees, will, upon your approach, be the residence for a few days of swans. 24.

In that direction, after reaching the capital city of Vidisha, you will earn the reward of fulfilling your desires, when you will drink the waters of Vetravati of river banks resonant with the sound of waves, like the face looking beautiful on account of the knitted brows.

25.

There, stay on the hill called ’नीचै', with Kadamba flowers in full bloom by your touch. It announces the boisterous youth of the citizens by exuding aromas of the love play of courtesans. 26.



If the possibility is established that the hill known to Kalidasa as ’नीचै:’ and the one called as ’विष्णुपदगिरि’ in the inscription on the Iron Pillar of Delhi are the same hill, search starts as to the probable original location of the Pillar on the hill. For this, we have to turn to knowledge of heavenly bodies and their motions possessed by Indians in the 5th century.
