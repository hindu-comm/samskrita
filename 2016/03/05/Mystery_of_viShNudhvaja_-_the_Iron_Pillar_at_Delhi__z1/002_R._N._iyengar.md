Dr.Balasubramanyam (Late) Professor at IITK did considerable research on the Iron Pillar. You might have seen his papers already, I am giving a link to one of his publications that some members here may like.

  

"Date of Sanakanika inscription and its astronomical significance for archaeological structures at Udayagiri."

The articles referred by him listed at the end are also equally interesting.
