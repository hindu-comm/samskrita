Earlier it was said that the Sanskrit texts put at GRETIL site have sandhi vicched already done. I want to know if the sandhi vicched is correct, especially in "  
nāsty andha" and "apy anarthāya" in the following text-  

  
  
aneka-saṃśayocchedi parokṣārthasya darśakam \|  
sarvasya locanaṃ śāstraṃ yasya nāsty andha eva saḥ // Hit_0.10 //  
  
yauvanaṃ dhana-sampattiḥ prabhutvam avivekitā \|  
ekaikam apy anarthāya kim u yatra catuṣṭayam // Hit_0.11 //
