I offer to make a font converter to convert the legacy font to Unicode (without any charge) . I can make three types of such converter-  
  

\(1\) a JavaScript based converter which will run in major browsers and convert plain text in legacy to Unicode.  
  

\(2\) a FoxReplace based converter which will work with Firefox browser and convert html legacy files to Unicode html files.  
  

\(3\) a macro for converting legacy doc files in OpenOffice/LibreOffice/MS_Office.
