hariH om!

Thanks Anunad Sing for your kind offer.

  

I'm not yet sure that we have digital copies in legacy fonts. Those were old days when maTha printed those books.

So, I'm expecting that most important works need to be keyed in Unicode from scratch.

  

Some recent publications are available in digital form. They may need the converter.

But, I'll have to confirm about how many they are, and how many types of legacy fonts were used?

  

I'm trying to get that information. I'll let you know.

Please, allow me some time to respond.

  

Thanks for your kind help.
