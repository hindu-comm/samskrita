In (1) above, 'labdham' in the first blank, 'prapsyante' in second blank are to be filled.

In (2), the word 'punyam' is to be filled, because it is in 'dwiteeya-vibhaktiH' which is needed being 'karma' the object & not the word 'punyaaya' which is in 'chaturthee-vibhaktiH' and it is not suitable.

God bless you.
