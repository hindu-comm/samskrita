Thanks for providing correct answers.

  
In (2), the word 'punyam' is to be filled, because it is in 'dwiteeya-vibhaktiH' which is needed being 'karma' the object & not the word 'punyaaya' which is in 'chaturthee-vibhaktiH' and it is not suitable.

Sorry for this explanation. It is in कर्मणि प्रयोग and प्राप्यतेे needs a कर्तृ प्रथमाविभक्ति and पुण्यं is in प्रथमाविभक्ति and not द्वितीया as you suggested. Here the will कर्म take प्रथमा.
