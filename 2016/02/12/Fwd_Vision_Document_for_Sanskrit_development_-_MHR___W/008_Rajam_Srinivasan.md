Sir;

  

This is a great idea. If the EducationDepartments/Ministries both at the center and state levels could be persuaded to encourage (with money and other resources) the Samskrut - teaching institutions (colleges, universities, PaaTHA shaalaas, Temples and Aashramaas etc) the project could be undertaken and completed in no-time. Each institution can select one or two "varNa"s, (aksharaas) and compile the dictionaries for their selected portions (within an alloted time-span). They could be ultimately "consolidated" into a delightful little volume with in say, 5 or 10 years. Once such a preliminary document is on hand, we can keep on editing and adding to it, and continuously enrich it.

  

There is a small and beautiful dictionary -- Kannada to Samskrut/English, created by some one (sorry, forgot the name) who was a scholar of Kannada and Sanskrit and was a member of a family (if I recall correctly) connected with the Mysore Kings'Court's "Pandit Sabha" or Assembly of Scholars.

  

Perhaps many of the erstwhileIndian rayal families' archives/librarieshave similar works strewn around (unpublished, of course) which could be discovered!

  

Regards
