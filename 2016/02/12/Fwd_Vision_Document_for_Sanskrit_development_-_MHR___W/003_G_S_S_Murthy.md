An excel sheet based project can be envisaged where different groups will work on different local languages simultaneously. However, we are a motley group with differing capabilities in our own languagesand Sanskrit. Sustained time-bound efforts are required which we may not be able to put in. It is best done by Sanskrit Academy, which can select scholars and fund the project.

Regards,

Murthy
