I think the target to complete these dictionaries should be less than ONE year and not 5 to 10 years. Also, these dictionaries need to be simple, by which I mean-  
  

1\) less than 20 thousand words,  

2\) only common words  

3\) No vyutpatti etc  

4\) targeting 10+2 level or less,  

5\) 'dominant' meanings only,  

6\) should be in Unicode text form, available for download and use on common digital platforms.  
  

Somewhere I read that some Sanskrit dictionary project is running in a college in Pune which has managed to complete one letter only in last 55 years or so.
