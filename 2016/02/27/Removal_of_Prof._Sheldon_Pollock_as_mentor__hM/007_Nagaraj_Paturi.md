Looking at the emotional aspects of some of these messages, I thought I should share the response of some dispassionate responses from which one can pick up a leaf or two:



First is the response from Prof. Dominik Wujastyk and the second is by the venerable young genius Sri Nityanandji both on the Indology forum.

> 1) While the petition of [change.org](http://change.org) has been > started by Prof. K  
> Ramasubramanian, as many as 131 Indian intellectuals apart from Prof. > K  
> Ramasubramanian signed the original plea to Mr. Narayana Murthy and > Mr.

> Prof. Ramasubramanian himself is a recipient of the Badarayan Vyas > Samman.  
>   
> 2) Apart from the aspects highlighted in Dr. Wujastyk's email, two > other  
> aspects which are very relevant to this petition: the letter by the  
> academicians mentions Mr. Rajiv Malhotra's \*Battle of Sanskrit\* as > well as  
> Prof. Pollock's recent signing of the solidarity statement with the  
> “students, faculty, and staff of JNU”: the petition against Prof. > Pollock  
> may well be a reaction to this. On the first aspect: Recently, Mr. > Rajiv  
> Malhotra's book has been widely discussed in Indian universities of > late.  
> Mr. Malhotra has been hosted by several Indian universities and > institutes  
> (e.g. Karnataka Sanskrit University and TISS) for talks where he has  
> received both support and opposition, but more support than opposition > as  
> far as I can say. On the second aspect, there was a discussion on > the  
> \*Bhāratīyavidvatpariṣat  
> \*mailing list (Mr. Rajiv Malhotra recently joined this mailing list). > The  
> thread was started by me, and I remarked in my short initial post > “Before

> decision.” The discussion can be read here:

>   
> My quick comments:  
> If it can be argued that the petition against Prof. Pollock is based > on  
> ‘misunderstanding’ or ‘wilful misconstrual’ (as members on this list > have  
> described), then it can also be argued that the solidarity statement > (to  
> which Prof. Pollock is a signatory) on the JNU issue is based on a > ‘lack of  
> understanding’ of jurisprudence in India or ‘wilful misrepresentation’ > of  
> facts. On jurisprudence: The Delhi Police has the documentary (video > tapes)  
> and non-documentary (eye-witnesses) evidence, and the Indian courts > will
