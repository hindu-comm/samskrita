I went through the petition and the list of signatories.

Sanskrit and the Vedic civilization has stood the test of time for so long that it does not need such petitions for survival. Let there be people expressing contrary opinions. It only strengthensSanskrit and Vedic civilization. This way of smothering contrary opinion is alien to our culture.

Regards,

Murthy
