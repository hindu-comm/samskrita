Sign the petition/don't sign the petition - that's your choice.  

But you certainly don't help your case when you make statements like these. Leaving aside the hissing "this" aside, why should anyone be ashamed for speaking one's mind?  



May I suggest you (and others as well) search for Prof. Ramasubramanian's lectures on youtube? You may learn a thing a or two.. If that's at least part of the reason you are here, that is.
