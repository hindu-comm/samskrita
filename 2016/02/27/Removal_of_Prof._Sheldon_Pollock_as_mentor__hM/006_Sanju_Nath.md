Please read Mr. Pollacks's work which emphasizes the exact opposite of Vairyaga, Samyama and respect for the great Saints of India who lived these values in the pursuit of truth. Throwing words like nationalism for a discussion on merits of one's argument and meeting criticism with sound answers - that's what is required by Mr. Pollack and perhaps Mr. Rivers given his support for Mr. Pollack. 

  

Convene a conference of purva-pakshi and siddhanti to defend the stand
- instead of a one sided assault from those who lead Sanskrit, Indian, Vedic studies at Harvard, Columbus, University of Chicago and other places in the West with mostly money power. Try doing it on Islamic culture and the real meaning of Nationalism will dawn.

  

Indians only want to debate, but this onslaught will also come to pass on a culture that has been around for millenia while many empires have come and gone because Vedas are based on Sat.

  

Cheers to all,  
Sanju
