Several sanskrit devanAgarI dictionaries released in the past have been updated to include latin keys. So, earlier you could search भानु and get results in several dictionaries, and you needed separate dictionary files to lookup "bhaanu". No more - every sanskrit dictionary with a devanAgarI key now also has a latin key, so, several old dictionaries are now rendered redundant and deprecated. You are welcome to delete them from your devices and reinstall dictionaries (eg: using scripts suggested here <https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/dictionaries> ).
