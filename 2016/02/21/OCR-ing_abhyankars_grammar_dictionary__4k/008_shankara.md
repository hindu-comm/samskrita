Vishvasji,

  

I appreciate your efforts in digitizing Sanskrit kosas. In the case of Abhyankar's dictionary it is necessary to note that this book is not yet in open domain. It was first published in 1961. I am not sure about the year of demise of the author (It must be after 1961). As per Indian Copyright act, a book goes to public domain only after 60 years from the year/date of demise of the author if the copyright is with the author or his family. If the copyright is with the publisher, then the book enters open domain after 60 years from the date of publication i.e. in this case it is in 1921.  



regards  
shankara
