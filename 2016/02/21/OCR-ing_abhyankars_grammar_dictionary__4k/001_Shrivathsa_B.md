hariH OM,  
sakhe,

If it is mixed (devanAgarii + english), it will be very difficult. send me a few page scans I can tell you how easy or difficult it is. For mixed content you may be better off typing from scratch.

If it is only devanAgarii content, send me the scans and I will do it. if the scans are of 300 dpi, the OCR output will be quite good.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
