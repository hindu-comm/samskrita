I am planning to seek volunteers for (what I hope) will be a [big OCR-ing project](https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/ocr/0-introduction) . But before that, I want to figure out the smoothest flows for proofreading. Can anyone help me achieve the views suggested by shrIvatsa for [this book](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/sanskrit-ocr-r0/tree/master/vaak/vyAkaraNam/abhyankar-grammar)?
