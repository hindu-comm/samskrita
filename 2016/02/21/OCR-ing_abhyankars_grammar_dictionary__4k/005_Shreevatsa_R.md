This is wonderful!

  

It may be better to keep the OCR result as separate pages, and have them associated with the original images.

  

This can help in two ways:

\(1\) whoever volunteers to proofread it can use something like Distributed Proofreaders (<http://www.pgdp.net/>) or Wikisource (see screenshots in attached images) to proofread the text by seeing the scanned book page beside it, and

\(2\) it may be helpful to include with each entry a link to the page in the book, so that even if the reader/user suspects OCR errors, they can click on the link and see the original page. (I've used this feature in the MW dictionary a few times.)
