Ken,  
  

 Communication is about communication.  
  
Its purpose is the transfer of information.  
  
Whatever the form it takes, in this case written, the information must be *meaningful*.  
  
The root problem here, is the Devanagari script itself - it was never designed with the QWERTY keyboard in mind!  
Have you not noticed that Roman/Latin/English employs capital letters to convey meaning?  
  
The International Standards Organisation on the other hand, certainly have, and much, much more, besides.  
Including the cost of a few billion new school text books on IPA. Not to mention all the world's grown ups having to be persuaded to learn a new alphabet - the teaching of the teachers to teach us all...  
  
I am beginning to suspect that you short of a noodle or two in your packet of Patanjali's (:-)  
  
Taff  
  
 I declare no affiliation whatsoever, neither with the ISO, nor indeed with Patanjali's Noodles.
