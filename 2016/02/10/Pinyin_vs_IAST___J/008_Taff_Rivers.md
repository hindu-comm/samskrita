Many people are not so much interested -in- Sanskrit as in the material content *of* Sanskrit - logic, reason wisdom and so on - medicine to name a few.  
I was able to read Plato's Republic and get wised up to sophistry at age twelve, in English text, not a Greek letter in sight.  
  
Not only was no Greek alphabet necessary, but neither was IPA.  
  
The subect matter of the emails in this topic is scripts, diacritics and IPA pronunciation, not language, however revered.  
  
Appropros, this being Valentines day, there is the expression *Love is blind*.

Did you get showered with the perfect IPA gliitter storm in your adventures with Cryllic?
