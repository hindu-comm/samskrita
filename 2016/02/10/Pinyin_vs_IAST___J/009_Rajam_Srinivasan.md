Sir;

  

Thank you, thank you AND thank YOU! :))

  

Finally, some down-to-earth, common sense statement!

  

Although I have been in awe of the stupendous cerebral adventures involved in these various attempts tocreate alternate designs (should I say "scriptal" or "lipi" or epigraphical designs?)to facilitate "learning to read-write-communicate" Samskutam, I Wondered --"Why not simply learn Devanaagari"? It will notconsumemore time, effort and energy. It may even be delightful or at least interesting!

  

Regards
