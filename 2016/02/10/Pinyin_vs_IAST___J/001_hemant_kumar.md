The article only mentions "Sanskrit be taught in Sanskrit only" with no mention of Devanagari script i.e. the language of instruction should be Sanskrit when teaching Sanskrit. It has no mention of script. I think all Indian scripts are sufficient to denote Sanskrit alphabets' sounds. Samskrit Bharati uses Kannada script in Karnataka region as far as I'm aware.
