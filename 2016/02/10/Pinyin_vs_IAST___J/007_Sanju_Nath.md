The projection is that Chinese will be the most common language on the net in recent future (in terms of number of users). Does English keyboard need to adapt to Chinese keyboard then, if the call today is to convert all other scripts to English because of them being inconsistent with QWERTY?  
  
How can देवनागरी, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, etc. letters not made for QWERTY keyboard be the root problem with any script other than English?  

  

There are millions of people creating content using the respective languages' original script on iphones/android/PCs - QWERTY is no longer a barrier, and there are overlays to QWERTY keyboards being used.  
  
The world's grown ups in India and China and elsewhere are already familiar with their respective script - no need to teach those teachers. They should not be forced to learn new ITRANS or equivalent which requires significant upfront effort and never quite seems to catch the sound and feel of the original script.  
  

Do we want to learn Chinese, etc. without learning their alphabet? Why so with Sanskrit?  

  

Sanju.
