Mr Ken,  
  

"Don't we need standard Roman Transliteration with improved transliteration scheme for Indian proper nouns?"  
  

There is no need for anyone to have to learn Chinese to transliterate Indian scripts into Roman.  
  
Please be advised that such has been availble for a few years now.  
  
**ISO 15919** has prescribed vowels for Vedic accents and much, much more.  
  
For those vowels see <http://homepage.ntlworld.com/stone-catend/trinoun3.gif>
