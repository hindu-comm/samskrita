Dear List,

  

Vast millions of students and scholars, from the last 1200 years since the modern Devanagari evolved out of the ancient Brahmi, have been mainly using Devanagari for the reading and writing of Sanskrit and, barring, a few insignificant regional exceptions, they, across all ages and regional boundaries, are comfortable doing so. It is true that some learners whose mother tongues are like Kannada, Telugu, Bengali do occasionally employ their regional scripts for writing Sanskrit. The result of doing so is that their writings remain confined to their own regions.

  

There may be all over the world a few thousand Sanskrit students and scholars who might think that it would be a good idea for everyone else to unlearn Devanagari and take up a Romanized version of Devanagari to read and write Sanskrit. So where does the balance of convenience lie?
Should the dog wag the tail or the tail wag the dog?

  

I learnt the Russian language several years ago. It has its own Cyrillic script. At the start the sript is somewhat confusing. That is for two reasons. Some of its letters are altogether unfamiliar and have to be learnt and internalized. A few others resemble normal Roman letters but are pronounced differently, such as the Roman 'p'. It is the 'r' of Russian. All these initial problems got sorted out with a few days of practice. Devanagari is somewhat more complex than Cyrillic but not beyond the scope of any common student.. 

  

So, IMHO, anyone wanting to pursue study in Sanskrit would be well advised to master the Devanagari and all his difficulties will vanish after he does that
