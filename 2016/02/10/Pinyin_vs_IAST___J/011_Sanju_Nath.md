Ken,

  

Appreciate the link. Good luck to the French in improving their keyboard, though not sure why without devoting time to understand the Ministry of Culture's approach to protecting French language or its purity.

  

I think artificial ways of communicating in any language is not required when the original script is so established, accurate and easy to pick up.

  

I did not know देवनागरी as a teenager. Took some effort spanning a short month, but now on an iPhone I can type on a देवनागरी keyboard almost as fast as I'm typing this in English.

  

I don't think India needs her English keyboard. India can use the American keyboard when needing to communicate in English. Likewise, a person wishing to communicate in Chinese needs to learn and use the keyboard that the Chinese use, same with other Indian languages, such as Tamil, Telgu, Gujarati, Bengali, etc. Same with हिन्दी and संस्कृत, given most written work of our saints and ऋषिs are in देवनागरी although much effort has been undertaken to convert a small fraction of that work to English alphabets. 

  

Here's the screen capture of the देवनागरी script used by nearly a billion people:

Why not go down the natural road?

  

I also have the other link sent which shows the ability to type in English Hindi words and it converts to देवनागरी. Here's a screenshot of that on my iPhone again:

Makes it even easier to transition. Such functionalities are available on all popular computers/phones, etc.

  

Personally, I think itrans scheme or similar was good when technology and choices were older, but hard to make a case for it now.

  

Apologize for the long email. 

  

Sincerely,

Sanju
