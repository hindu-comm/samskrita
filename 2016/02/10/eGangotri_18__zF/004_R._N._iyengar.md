Dear Sri Pandey,

This is a great service to the knowledge traditions of India. I am personally interested in the "history of science and intellectual concepts" as developed in India, particularly before the common era. In this search, I find that Bhattotpala (10th Cent.) a Kashmirian had access to more ancient literature than others. His commentary on Brhatsamhita is available in print. He quotes from the original Parasharatantra and Vrddhagargasamhita extensively. I am wondering whether manuscripts of Parasharatantra are still available in J&K. I request you to make available manuscripts if any on astronomy/Jyotisha attributed to Parashara and Garga.

regards

  

RN Iyengar
