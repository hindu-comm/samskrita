Dear List Members

  

Can you please explain the traditional way of learning Samskrita [i.e.in](http://i.e.in) a step by step approach.

  

My idea of learning is

1.Teaching Sabda Ratnakara & Dhatu Ratnakara

2.Teaching of Pancha Mahakavyas

3\. Focus on Vyakarana, Alamkara and Other sastraic aspects of Mahakavyas

4.Mahabhashya and other texts.

  

Is this the right approach.

please guide

  

Regards

Ravikumar Dhulipala
