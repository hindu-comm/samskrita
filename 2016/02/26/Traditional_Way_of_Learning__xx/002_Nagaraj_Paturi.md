Response:



1\. Traditionally Sanskrit was learnt as different streams of Shastras : Saahitya, Tarka / Nyaaya, VyaakaraNa, Meemaamsa, and Vedanta



2\. To enter into any stream, basic learning was usually through one of the chapters of a Kavya such as Raghuvams'a or Kumarasambhava, where through aakaankshaa method basics of comprehending Sanskrit were taught. Before this stage was begun, Amarakos'a, Subanta tables and Tinganta tables were made to be taken by heart. Usually, this stage of teaching was done by a senior student (Aas'ramaagraja) to a junior student (Aas'ramaanuja). Sometimes teacher did the first round, repeating( chintana)was made to be supervised by the senior students. Some basic sutras of Laghukaumudi were also provided.



3\. Learning Pancha Mahakavyas, Alankara texts etc. forms part of Saahitya stream only. One could go to, say, tarka / nyaaya stream without doing this.



4\. Mahabhashya is considered part of the advanced stage of , that too, only the Vyaakarana stream.
