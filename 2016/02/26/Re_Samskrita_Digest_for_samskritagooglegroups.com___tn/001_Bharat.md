Further on the crowd-sourcing idea, PyBossa might be a good way to do the crowdsourcing proofreading and correction.

It supports importing PDF files and micro-tasking the review of each page. It is free, open-source and doesn't restrict our activities in any way (for example, by stipulating that the resulting work be placed in open domain).

  

Below is an excerpt about how to use PyBossa to crowd-review pdfs of books etc.

## I have a set of poorly scanned PDFs

We've got you covered! PyBossa can import PDF files and make them available to your users, so that they can extract key information. All you have to do is upload your PDF files (with scanned images included, no problem!) to your Dropbox account (PyBossa is integrated with Dropbox) or host them in your own web server. Then, use our 'PDF data-mining' template to ask your users to extract the information you require.

The template allows you to zoom in and out of the PDF (pretty handy when documents are hand written) and navigate between pages. A task might involve analysis of a whole document, or just a few pages – it's up to you to decide. Moreover, you can use the PyBossa.JS library to integrate your template with third party online services like Open Corporates or Encyclopedia of Life. This allows you to run queries about the data contained in the PDFs, so your users can input the best possible information. Simple yet advanced!

If there is any positive reaction to this post, I can look into setting it up and trying it out.
