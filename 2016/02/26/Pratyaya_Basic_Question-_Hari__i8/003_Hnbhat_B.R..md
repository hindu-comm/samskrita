\> Because पठis dhatu then my example below must be wrong, am I correct?  
\> तद्धितान्तप्रातिपदिकम्example is'पठवत्' 'पठवती' 'पठवत्'

It is because मतुप् suffix is added noun, to give the meaning "one having the noun " like धनम् अस्य अस्ति --  
धन-मतुप् = धनवान्।

\> If no then what could be the meaning of it.

You have to answer the question if पठ is not धातु - what is meaning.

\> You mean accusitive case is incorrect use and Genetivecase is correct?

\> धेनुम् दानम् (Accusitive Case ) Donation of Cow  
\> धेनोः दानम् (Genetive Case) Donation of Cow

If you mean Donation of Cow, then धेनोः दानम्, or धेनुदानम् both are correct. धेनुुं ददाति is correct. धेनुं दानं ददाति is also correct according to the usage what do you mean?

\> पतितम् has what pratya and what is the meaning it "has fallen" / "had Fallen" /"is fallen"  
\>

पतिततम् क्त suffix with. meaning "fallen" past passive participle of धातुु - पत् meaning "to fall".
