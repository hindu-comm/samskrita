महोदय,

  

I got following information from internet but I am little confused. Can you please help me clearing the doubts.

  

Question 1

क्तवतु प्रत्यय is कृदन्तप्रातिपदिकम् Pratyaya used to convert verb into Past Tense verb. For example.गतवान्, गतवती, गतवत्

  
मतुप् प्रत्यय is तद्धितान्तप्रातिपदिकम्example is'पठवत्' 'पठवती'
'पठवत्'

  

what is the difference between these two pratyaya.

  

Question 2

Which one is correct out of these three? And what is the meaning of others.

वृक्षं नष्टम भवति

वृक्षं नष्ट: भवति

वृक्षं नाशति

  

Question 3

Which one is correct out of thesethree? And what is the meaning of others.

धेनु: दानम्

धेनुदानम्

धेनुम् दानम्

  

I know my questions are very basic but I donot know who can help me so posted here.

  

Warm Regards

Hari
