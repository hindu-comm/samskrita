We're seeking volunteers to contribute to a sanskrit OCR project (which may be particularly useful for existing projects such as sanskrit wikipedia/ wikisource). Particularly proof-readers.

  

Details about the scope of the project, what's involved and how to join up (from the[Project homepage](http://i.imgur.com/h4K8Jqk.jpg)[here](https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/ocr/0-introduction)):

========================

  

## Purpose

-   OCR important Sanskrit texts whose digitized versions are not
    available. -   Proofread OCR-ed texts to fix errors.

### Why digitize?

-   Want to easily search for the source of that amazing shloka someone
    mentioned? -   Want to look up a certain term in (say) the abhyankar grammar
    dictionary on your phone? -   Want to read flowing text comfortably on your tablet on phone? Want
    your annotations to be safe for ever? (See advantages
    described[here](https://sites.google.com/site/sanskritcode/tutorials/book-making)) -   Want to carry an entire library on your tablet? -   Want your phone to read out a certain text? -   
    

    Dream of a richer sanskrit wikipedia, wikisource etc..?
