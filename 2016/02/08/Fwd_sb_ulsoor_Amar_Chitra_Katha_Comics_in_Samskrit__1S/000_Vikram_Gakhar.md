Amar Chitra Katha Comics in Samskritam: Show your Support !

How would you like the highly fascinating Amar Chitra Katha comic books to be available in Samskritam ?

Samskrita Bharati’s Bangalore volunteers are taking precisely this task in a big way. They are working with Amar Chitra Katha Publications to be their Samskrit translation partner to persuade them to publish their comics in pure and simple Samskrit.

For this, they need to do a readership survey to assess the demand for Samskrit comics among the public.

SB Ulsoor division has been posting Ramayana in pictures for months now in their mailing list sb_ulsoor AT [googlegroups.com](http://googlegroups.com) as well as their website: <http://sites.google.com/site/ramayanasanskrit/page49>

As a Samskrit lover, we urge you to participate in this survey and show your support for this exciting activity. You can also participate in the translation effort, if you feel comfortable.

Please click on the link below to participate in the survey: <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/S37T8RP>

Exciting times are ahead for Samskrit literature for kids (both in age and at heart)!!
