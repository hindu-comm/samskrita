Upadhmaaniya is pure oshthya. Apart from that, in Sanskrit a vowel cannot be combined after that. Similarly, the aspirate 'h' in English is defined as 'breathing upon a vowel' i.e. there cannot be 'h' not followed by a vowel in English. In Sanskrit, ha or other aspirated consonants like kha can occur not followed by a vowel also.

  

Due to the influence of English where ph and f sounds are same in some places, while transliterating Sanskrit to English, people use 'f' in place of proper 'ph' as in 'Prafulla' 'Fagun' in place of 'Phalguni' etc. I have come across the spelling 'prafulla' many times - I have not come across anyone writing as praphulla so far.
