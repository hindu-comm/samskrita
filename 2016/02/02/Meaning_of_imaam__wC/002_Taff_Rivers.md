Prabha,  
  
 Not as an entryword, but within the body of the definition for *ima*, in the Monier-Williams,  
there occurs *imām:  
*  

ima  
 • the base of some cases of the demonstrative pronoun idam, q.v. (acc. sg. m. imam f. *imām*.; nom m. pl. m. ime, &c.  
 • irregular gen. sg. imasya, ṚV. viii, 13, 21 \[once\]). \[167,3\]  

  
  

Where *the demonstrative pronoun idam,* simply means *this*.  
  
  

BTW.  

A capital letter I, transliterates as a the long vowel ī, which was probably unintentional, but will lead to missing the word with the short vowel.
