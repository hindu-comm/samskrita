Kavya (poem)s are classified into Gadya (Only prose ), Padya(only verse )and Champu(Verse interspersed by prose ). Kadambari is a great Gadyakavya.



Nataka (play)s have both prose and verse. Prose here is spoken/ conversational. There is a huge repertoire of Sanskrit plays.



All commentatorial writing in Sanskrit is in prose form. This is huuuuuuuge.



Patanjali's Mahabhashya reflects a rich environment of spoken Sanskrit in prose in day to day life situations.
