hariH OM,

There are many online sources available for basic to advanced Sanskrit. Hence please plan as to how you will prevent reinventing the wheel.

You can also think of devoting your time to organizations such as Samskrita Bharati or Vyoma Linguistic Labs and work as a force multiplier for their efforts.

Contact me off list if you want to discuss the above.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
