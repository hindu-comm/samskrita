Namasthe,

  

Kindly let me know if anyone knows Sanskrit and if you are interested to volunteer in helping with basic tutorial of Sanskrit. Planning to post from scratch VERY basic Sanskrit lessons in FB group to motivate and make people start learning Sanskrit, and need mentors who could answer simple question if arises. You need not prepare any posts , but only help if any simple questions arises. Your support will be really helpful.

  

Thanks in advance.  

Sincerely
