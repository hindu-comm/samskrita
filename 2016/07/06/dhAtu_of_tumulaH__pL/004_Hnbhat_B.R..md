What is your problem? You asked whether it can be used as verb and I answered. It is a noun or adjective as per lexicon तुमुलं रणसंकुलम् and I have given the meanings धातु for deriving the word. If you have seen it used as verb, than noun or adjective, you can use it in two ways.

It does not mean you can use पठति or पठयति for the धातु - पठ व्यक्तायां वाचि which is never used as noun or adjective. With णिच्, it will be पाठयति and would mean make one to read or to teach. It will be depending on the meaning you want to make.
