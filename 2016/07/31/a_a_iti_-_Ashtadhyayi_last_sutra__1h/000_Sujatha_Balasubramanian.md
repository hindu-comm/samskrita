My doubt pertains to the last sutra of Ashtadhyayi अ अ इति

  

I read Bhattoji DIkshita's explanation in the Siddhanta Kaumudi that the during the प्रक्रिया, अकार was विवृत.

  

Now in the final sutra, after all the प्रक्रिया is over and when it is time for प्रयोग, Panini makes the अकार as संवृत.

  

What does संवृत. mean, practically? What is the difference between अकार being विवृत and अकार being संवृत.?

  

Will this mandate- अकार being made into संवृत apply to इकार also ?

  

Thank you.
