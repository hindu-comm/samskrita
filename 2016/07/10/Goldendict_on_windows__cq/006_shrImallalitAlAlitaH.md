Try this:

  

Copy paste from older thread on this Group:  
  
  
1. Paste the following into a notepad (text file). I use notepad++. You may have to download it.  
  

**body  
{  
margin-top: 1px;  
margin-right: 3px;  
margin-left: 2px;  
margin-bottom: 3px;  
background: white;  
font-family: Siddhanta, Sanskrit2003, Kokila;  
font-size:18px;  
}**  
  
2. Paste the following in the 'save as' field and save the file.  
**%appdata%\\GoldenDict\\article-style.css**  
Replace, if it asks for that.  
  
3. In Windows folder options, disable 'hide known file extensions'.  
  
4. Open the following folder (replace \*\*\*\* with your Windows username).

**C:\\Users\\\*\*\*\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\GoldenDict**  
  
5. Check the extension of the file. If it is .css, then OK. Otherwise, change the file extension of the text file to css. i.e. article-style.txt(or anything) to article-style.css.  

  

6\. If GoldenDict is open. Close it - by right clicking on the icon situated in notification area and pressing quit/exit -- or by clicking File>Exit in the application window.  
  
7. Restart GoldenDict.  
  
I hope it helps.

  

If it doesn't, then inform us.
