Krishna went to the Kauravas to negotiate a settlement after the Pandavas went for 12 years Vanavasa and 1 year

Ajnaatha Vasa. They were supposed to get back Indraprastha.

  

Duryoydhana was not prepared to give the Pandavas even one house to each of the Pandavas.

Finally he said -

  

"yaavad hi thiikkshnayaa suchyaa vidhyedagrena kesava /

thaavadapyaparityaajyam bhumernah paandavaan prathi //

  

I will not yield to them even as much territory as will be

covered by the point of a needle.

  

The same meaning is contained in a Malayalam saying -

  

suuchi kuthuvaan pazhuthu paandavrku kotukkilaa /
