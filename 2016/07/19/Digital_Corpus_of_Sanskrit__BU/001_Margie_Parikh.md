Dear Professor Hellwig,

  

Thank you for sharing the update. I visited the site and was fascinated by the richness of its content.

Out of curiosity, I searched for tagged parallels for Gautamadharmasutras. A list of parallels appeared (Manusmruti and Mahabharata having 16 and 14 parallels). However, Gautamadharmasutra also appeared, and showed 10 parallels. I wondered how this correspondence could have been arrived. I would appreciate it if you or any one else in the forum could shed light.

  

With my namaskara to everyone on Guru Purnima,

margie
