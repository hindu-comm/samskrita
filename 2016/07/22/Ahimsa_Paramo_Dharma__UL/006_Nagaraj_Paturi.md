When I say, it is not there in Mahabharata, I mean that I was not able to find the exact words in Mahabharata.

  

But the spirit of the words 'dharma himsaa tathaiva cha' can be defended to be not in contradiction with the spirit of the book Mahabharata which in turn is not in contradiction with the Vedic worldview that is in the upabrimhita form in the Panchama Veda.

  

Himsaa has two meanings : 1. Any violence in general 2. violence that is not justiciable (violence inflicted on the helpless innocent persons)

  

Violence (in the meaning of any violence in general)committed in order to punish or preventa person resorting to violence that is not justiciable (violence inflicted on the helpless innocent persons)is considered to be nonviolence 'ahimsaa' (nonviolence) only.

  

Kshatriya is viewed as the one who savespeople from getting kshati. A kshatriya's violence is violence (in the meaning of any violence in general)committed in order to punish or preventa person resorting to violence that is not justiciable (violence inflicted on the helpless innocent persons) and as suchis considered to be nonviolence 'ahimsaa' (nonviolence) only.

  

Kshatriya's violence is 'paritraaNaaya saadhoonaam vinaas'aaya cha dushkritaam'

  

Ahimsaa in the meaning of no violence of any kind

  

and himsaa in the sense of violence (in the meaning of any violence in general)committed in order to punish or preventa person resorting to violence that is not justiciable (violence inflicted on the helpless innocent persons)which in this senseis considered to be nonviolence 'ahimsaa' (nonviolence) only

  

are distributed among varNas and aas'ramas.

  

There are mantras in the Vedas ending in 'sugrichcha' and alsothose ending in 'maa himseeh'. This apparent contradiction gets resolved when the Vedic worldview is understood from the above described perspective.

  

Butdefending that theexactwords are available in Mahabharata is what I leave to someone from Swami Chinmayananda's organization
