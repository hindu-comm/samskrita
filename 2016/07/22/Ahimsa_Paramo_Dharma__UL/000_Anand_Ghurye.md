Dear Friends ,

  

This following shloka though is attributed to Mahabharata , does not seem to be there in Mahabharata .

  

Can anyone tell me as to where this shloka appears ?

  

Secondly is the first part , Ahimsa .... and the second part match with the chandas of Mahabharata time ?

  

### Ahimsa paramo dharmaha, dharma himsa tathaiva cha »Non-violence is the greatest dharma, so too is all righteous violence. –*Mahabharata*

  

Thanks in advance. 

  
  
Regards ,
