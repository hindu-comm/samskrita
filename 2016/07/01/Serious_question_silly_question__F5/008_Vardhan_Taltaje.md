Mr. Taff,  
  
It looks like Dr. Bhat was answering a side question asked by Sri Pradyumna Achar and not to your question.  
  
I think that in case of indeterminable gender, the masculine is used. We often see questions like कोऽस्ति (कः अस्ति)? कोऽत्र (कः अत्र)?  
I don't know if there exists any rule that specifies this or if it is just a convention.
