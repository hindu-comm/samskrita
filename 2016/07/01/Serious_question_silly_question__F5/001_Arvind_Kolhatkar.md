Taff,

  

I would think that in Sanskrit writings no attempt is seen to distinguish between lions and lionesses. They are allसिंह or one of its synonyms. Amarakosha does not give a separate word for the female of the lion.

  

The situation is different for other animals. A female elephant is करेणु, a female fox is शिवा, a female dear is कुरङ्गी, एणी. or हरिणी etc.
