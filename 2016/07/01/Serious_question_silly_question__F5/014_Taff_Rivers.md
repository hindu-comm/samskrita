All,

  

 Am I correct in thinking that under the circumstances, a genderless indeclinable is appropriate.

  

A non-specific adverbial, ***हन्त******hanta***! perhaps?

  

*hanta*

   • ind. an exclamation or inceptive particle (expressive of an exhortation to do anything or asking attention, and often translatable by 'come on!' 'here!' 'look!' 'see!' in       later language also expressive of grief, joy, pity, haste, benediction &c. and translatable by 'alas!' 'ah!' 'oh!' &c. ; often repeated or joined with other particles,         e.g. hā_hanta, hanta_hanta, hanta_tarhi), ṚV. &c. &c. \[1288,2\]

  

Taff,
