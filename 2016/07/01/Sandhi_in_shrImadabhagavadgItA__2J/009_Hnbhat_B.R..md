There seems real problem in the verse itself. On the other hand, राधन without prefix does not have the meaning "worship". If you split as तस्या आराधन it will get required meaning, but the आ will make a letter redundant in Anushtup meter making 9 syllables instead of 8.

Your splitting has to be accepted assuming that even without the prefix, the verb gives the same meaning. The other way is to split as तस्य आराधनमम् and the masculine pronoun refers to देव assuming तनु in the previous verse implicit in the verse and explicit in the next verse. This is the second solution. In both you have to make some compromise has to be made.
