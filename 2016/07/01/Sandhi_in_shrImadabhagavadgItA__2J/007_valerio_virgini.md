Respected members,

Thank you all for your suggestions.

  

In this manuscript the two words seem separate,

and the feminine pronoun could be referred to tanum, in the previous verse.  

In addition, the masculine pronoun tasya does not seem to have meaningful connections.

This verse is too complex for my Sanskrit level.  

  

Thanks for your help.  

  

valerio
