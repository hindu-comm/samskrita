Valerio and others,

  

 There is neither a **tasya ārādhanam** nor a **tasyāḥ** **rādhanam** present in the **devanagari** sutra:

  

       स **तया श्रद्धया** युक्तस्तस्याराधनमीहते।  

  

  Both **tayā** and **śraddhayā** are feminine.

    Valerio. Are you really asking why those two Devanagari words (incorrect transliterations aside) are not co-joined (sandied)?

    Because a word having a final vowel, after inflection, followed by an initial consonant doesn't get sandied.

  

    Anyway, the Gita is a work that tells of ways that us mortals can reach the beyond, adapted to our individual abilities.

    It's not the ideal text to use as exercise book on Sanskrit grammar, speaking from personal experience.
