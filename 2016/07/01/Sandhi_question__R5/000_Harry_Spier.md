Dear list members,  

  

Are both these spellings correct according to the rules of sandhi?

  

नानाछित्र or नानाच्छित्र

  

Looking at the grammars of MacDonell and Whitney I thought that both these spellings were OK but when I did a search through the texts in the Muktabodha digital library **ch** was never doubled in a compound after **nānā**  

  

Thanks,  

Harry Spier
