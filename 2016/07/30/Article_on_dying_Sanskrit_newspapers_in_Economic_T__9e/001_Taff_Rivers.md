Nityanand,

  

  The movement away from increasingly uneconomic paper media to the more economical electronic media has been going on for at least a decade.

  

  There is a wealth of digital material to be had for anyone interested in Sanskrit itself, for whatever reason.

  Thankfully, there is no copyright for Sanskrit, though there are those to would like to monopolise it.

  

  However, no amount of promotion is ever going to make Sanskrit 'popular' and break box office records. Not even in its assumed home country.

 

  Sanskrit is intellectually challenging, to say the least.  

  And those that have mastered the language are deserving of respect.

 

  Under the circumstances one would question the wisdom of those that would promote the unpromotable.

  Surely any government funds are better invested in training Sanskrit scholars, not in propping up uneconomic newspapers.

  As is actually done in many countries, east and west of India.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff
