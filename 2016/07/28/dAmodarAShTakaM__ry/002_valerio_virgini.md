Thanks dr. Bhat  

  

but your response makes me cast doubt that perhaps I did not understand something else:  

  

आख्यापयन्तम् is it apresent participle active ātmanepada causative?So I read: "is doing to understand" ... right?  

  

तदीयेशित-ज्ञेषुamong those (because it is locative) who are aware of such majesty...It can be right?

  

thans
