In the book Pranama Ramayanam by Late Subramania Sastrigal, the opening verse of BALA KANDAM is “:वेलोल्लङ्घनकृद्दयाजलनिधिर्व्यालोलभृङ्गोल्लस-

त्कालोत्फुल्लसरोजचारुवदनो नीलोत्पलश्यामल: ।

लीलोत्खण्डितभीमकार्मुकवर; कालोऽसतां पालने

लोलो दीनजनस्य कोसलसुताबालोस्तुऽ मे श्रेयसे ॥”

  

Sri Rama Ghanapatigal of Hyderabad has translated the meaning of all the 682 verses of this Kavyam in TAMIL. He has translated the opening wrd “वेलोल्लङ्घनकृत्” - as “ RAMA,-who has crossed the ocean limit to save Sita Devi”-ஸ்ரீ தேவியான ஸீதையைக் காப்பதற்காகக் கடலெல்லையைத் தாண்டின கருணைக்கடலும்”

Presumably he has construed the word“वेलोल्लङ्घनकृत्”-वेलाम् उल्लङ्घन कृत् कर्ता -वेलाम्- as the ocean limit - ‘समुद्र्कूलम् .

It is Hanuman who crossed the ocean first and SRI RAMA thereafter As the opening verse is ‘मङ्गलाचरणम् , I doubt that this could have been the intention of the poet to use the word .वेलोल्लङ्घनकृत् in the beginning of the verse in BALA KANDAM.

According to शब्दकल्पद्रुम the word वेला -काल:।तत् पर्याय:।समय: . Therefore the intention of the poet could have been to indicate ब्रह्मor
बह्मतत्वम् , which transcends both time and space-कालदेशावधिभ्यां निर्मुक्तं. .

Is such interpretation tenable? I request scholars to clarify.
