There was a girl who was very learned in Sanskrit. Many eligible bachelors wanted to marry her. When one such person

approached her she tested him with some questions.

  

Question 1. What is the noun of Vihasya.   Answer given - Shashti vibhakti of Vihas such as ramasya.

Correct answer - avyayam

  

Question 2. What is the noun of Vihaaya.   Answer given - Chathurthy vibbakti of Vihas such as ramaya.

Correct answer - avyayam.

  

What is the vibhakti of aham - answer given - dvitiya of ah

Correct answer - prathama

  

What is the vibhakti of katham - answer given - dvitiya of katha Cirrect answer - avyayam.

  

The girl did not agree to be his dvitiyaa or wife stating that he has answered all the questions wrongly.

  

yasya shashtii chathurthii cha vihasya cha vihaaya cha /

aham katham dvitiiyaa syaat dvithiiyaa syaam aham katham //

  

Meaning - How can I be a wife to him who says vihasya is shashthii

and vihaaya is chathuthii (both are avyaya) and aham and katham are

dvitiiya (aham is pratahama and katham is avyaya).
