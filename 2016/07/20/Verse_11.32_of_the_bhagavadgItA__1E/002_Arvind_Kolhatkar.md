Sorry that I was misled into writing the above. I had checked the word ऋत in the online version of MW which only showed the meaning of that word. When I double-checked with the printed copy of the same dictionary, it showed the word ऋते, meaning \`excluding\`, as an अव्यय.

  

Dr Bhat\`s helpful reply below says the same.
