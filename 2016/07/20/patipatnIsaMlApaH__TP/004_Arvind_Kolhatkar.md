Manishji,

  

Quite a few English translations ofचौरपञ्चाशिका are available on the internet. The best-known is Edwin Arnold's translation of 1896.
Artistically produced with lots of paintings, it is a good translation but not very faithful to the original. It shows the Sanskrit verses side by side with their translation. ( I also did not like some of the pictures because they are more representative of Islamic culture that old Indian culture and do not fit well in a Sanskrit book. Perhaps, to colonial Brits, both looked alike, but we, as Indians, can distinguish the nuances.). It is available in [archive org](https://archive.org/stream/chaurapanchsika00bilhgoog#page/n10/mode/2up)

  

Another translation, this by E.Powys Mathers, is available at [Sacred Books.](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/bilhana/bil01.htm)This also is somewhat of a loose translation.

  

The Sanskrit text is available at several places, for example in the Kavyamala Series.
