Dear Arvind ji,

  

Thank you! I think your translation is quite magnificent! I also liked your tal tiip.तळटीप : प्रस्तुत लेखकाच्या इच्छेनुसार या लेखात शुद्धलेखनाचे नवे नियम पाळण्यात आलेले नाहीत. I really hate the 'new rules of Shuddha Lekhan' in Marathi. They have simply destroyed the spellings. No wonder younger kids today are clueless about basic vartani. It reflects negatively in their writing as well as their inability to appreciate good, solidly written literature.  
  
To come back to the point, I loved your translation and saw the inherent flaws in the two English translations you kindly directed me towards. So how about you translating this text into English? To me, you are equally proficient in Sanskrit, Marathi and English. So if you are willing to carry out an English translation of the same standard as your Marathi translation, you have got yourself a publisher.

  

I would love to publish this Sanskrit text along with an English translation under my imprint.It will be a simple paperback edition, but it will be lovingly and proudly published.

  

Manish
