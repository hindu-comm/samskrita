Dear Dr Kolhatkar,  
Jay Jinendra

  

Since my Marathi is better than my Sanskrit, I enjoyed the beauty and simplicity of your translation. In fact, your translation helped me appreciate the subtle nuances of the mula patha, which would otherwise have been lost on me.

  

I would love to publish an English translation of the Caurapancashika. Has it been done? If not, would you be interested in doing it?

  

Yours,

Manish
