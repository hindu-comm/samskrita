Dear All,

My poem पतिपत्नीसंलापः has been published in !-16 July issue of संस्कृतसंवादः, a Samskrut fortnightly from Delhi.As the PDF of the periodical is too large, I am circulatingin thisgroup the PDF of my poem only. Members are requested to spare time to peruse the same. Comments and criticisms are welcome. I have already circulated the same in Bharatiya VIdvat Parishat. I may be excused for cross posting.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
