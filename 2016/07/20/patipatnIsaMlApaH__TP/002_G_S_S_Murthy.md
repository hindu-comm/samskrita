Many thanks, Aravindji.

I went to your web-site where "Chaura-panchasika" with your Marathi translation is posted. Unfortunately, I do not know Marathi. I was aware of the refrain of the verses and the back ground story associated with "Caurapanchasika", but I havenot read through the text.

Regards,

Murthy
