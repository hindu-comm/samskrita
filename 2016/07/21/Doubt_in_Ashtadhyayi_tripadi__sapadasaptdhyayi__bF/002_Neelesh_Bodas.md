Kashika Nyaas mentions this in the commentary of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् -
"कार्यकालं संज्ञापरिभाषम् । कार्यकालाः कार्यप्रयुक्ता: हि संज्ञाः परिभाषाश्च ।" That is, theसंज्ञा and theपरिभाषा are applicablewhere-ever there is an appropriate place / time for their application (evenacross the boundaries ofसपादसप्ताध्यायी/त्रिपादी ). This allows the इत्संज्ञा of उँ from रुँ. Now, the only reason why "तस्य लोप:" existsis to elide theइत्संज्ञावर्ण, and hence it logically follows that we applyतस्य लोप: and elide उँ, leaving behind र् on which खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीय: can be applied.
