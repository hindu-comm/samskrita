"The Sanskrit Library site has an integrated dictionary page at <http://sanskritlibrary.org/integratedDictionaries.html> "It is The Sanskrit Library and CDSL in a collaborative project that developed some 35 dictionaries that are now available at both sites, not CDSL by itself. The funding for these projects came from a joint program by the U.S. NEH and the German DFG (the grant proposal for which was written by Professor Peter M. Scharf). All of these sources are available at the Sanskrit Library in an integrated interface. Although the default page shows just four dictionaries, additional dictionaries are displayed by adding them in the preferences/dictionaries menu."
