एक: नास्तिक: विमाने उपविशन् बालिकां कृते संभाषनार्थं स्वस्य इच्छां प्रकटितवान् \|

पुस्तकं पठन् बालिका तं पृष्टवती - कस्योपरि ?

  

नास्तिक: - देव: नास्ति खलु, स्वर्ग: नरक: इत्यादि भ्रान्ति एव \|

  

बालिका- अश्व:, गाव:, मृग: इमे तृणम् एव खादन्ति परन्तु तस्या: मला:सदृशम् किमर्थंन भविष्यति ?

  

नास्तिक: - अहं न जानामि \|

  

बालिका- भवान् मलस्योपर्यपि न जानन्ति , भगवद्विषये अथवा स्वर्ग: नरक: इत्यादीनां विषये संभाषणं कर्तुं योग्यता अस्ति वा ? इति पृष्ट्वा पुन: स्वपुस्तकं पठितवती \|

  

  

An atheist (nastik)was seated next to a little girl on an airplane and he turned to her and said, "Do you want to talk? Flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger."

  

The little girl, who had just started to read her book, replied to the total stranger, "What would you want to talk about?"

  

"Oh, I don't know," said the atheist. "How about why there is no God, or no Heaven or Hell, or no life after death?" as he smiled smugly.

  

"Okay," she said. "Those could be interesting topics but let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same

stuff - grass. Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, but a horse produces clumps. Why do you suppose that is?"

  

The atheist, visibly surprised by the little girl's intelligence, thinks about it and says, "Hmmm, I have no idea."

  

To which the little girl replies, "Do you really feel qualified to discuss God, Heaven and Hell, or life after death, when you don't know shit?"

  

And then she went back to reading her book.
