Bhatt Mahodaya.

There has been some lack of clarity in my earlier letter and would like to express the same doubt again, rephrasing itin different words.

I desired to know this: If one wants to express 'Once Chitragupta told (or said to) Brahma', would it not be natural to say: एकदा चित्रगुप्त: ब्रह्मम् अवदत्। What is the significance of ब्रह्मा समीपे in this context. Is it for conveying (he said to) Brahma or is it for conveying he spoke standing near Brahma (to anyone)? In Tamil, it is common to use 'near' in the context of telling some one. eg नान् अवन् किट्ट् सोन्नेन् - I told him. एन्किट्ट पेसादे - do not talk to me etc. As I mentioned earlier, I have come across use of 'सन्निधि’ to convey a similar meaning:

त्वत्सन्निधौ यत्कथयेत् पतिस्ते यद्यप्यगुह्यं परिरक्षितव्यम् । in a work on स्त्रीधर्म

I have not expressed any doubt about the usage 'तव भर्तु:कर्णमूले प्रणवपदविशेषम् बोधयमास '\| I only said that 'into the ear' in this context was used to convey 'secrecy'.

With reverence,

R Subrahmanian
