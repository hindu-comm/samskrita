**C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer practiced law on his own and made a reputation as a
lawyer.^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Ramaswami_Iyer#cite_note-cpp39-13))He fought and won over 300 cases^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Ramaswami_Iyer#cite_note-cpp39-13))  
and was offered a judgeship of the[Madras High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_High_Court "Madras High Court")which he, however, turned down.

**I had heard that when the post of a judge was offered to him he said =**

**  
**

**I earn enough as a lawyer by telling lies for halfan hour, more than what I would earn as a judge by**

**hearing lies for six hours.**
