There is no पश्यति in the first joke.

But चित्रगुप्तः ब्रह्मा समीपे उक्तवान् does not mean any thing like you said. Both are in प्रथमा and only one क्रियापद for both. ब्रह्मणः समीपे/सकाशे etc. would convey the idea yousuggested.

It is purely Sanskrit likeतं कर्णमूलमागत्य रामे श्रीन्यैस्यतामिति कैकेयो शङ्कये वाच पलितक्कद्मना जरा ॥ २ ॥ in RAghuvamsha and no need to go for regional langugage idioms.

  

  

In all the highlighted portions posted by me it is not Sanskrit at all.

  

साम्यत्व पति:एव प्राप्स्यन्त:???  

  

etc.
