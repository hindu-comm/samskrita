I came across some humorous dig at grammarians.

  

These are to be taken lightly and left at that, no point in taking it as blasphemy here. No offence meant.

  

Some say AdiShankaracharya's in BhajaGovindam "nahi nahi rakshati dukrinj karane" itself is a humorous quip on grammarians.

  

There is also a story I heard that Panini Maharaj was killed by a tiger while he was giving out Ashtadhyayi Sutrapatha to students. As the tiger attacked him he shouted "a A" and the students dutifully wrote that cry also as a Sutra which is the last one in Ashtadhyayi.

  

Another idiom goes like this, Taddhitamoodaa: Vaiyaakaraneeyaa:... One meaning is, the grammarians are obsessed with Taddita pratyayas as they are so huge in number and so many possibilities. The other meaning is Taddhitam oodaa: - the one that carries tadditham... meaning the grammarians carry the treasure of tadditha pratyayas in their mind.
