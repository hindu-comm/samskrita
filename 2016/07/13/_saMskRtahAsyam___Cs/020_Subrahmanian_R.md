Sir, No doubt the jokes are enjoyable, even if some of them have been seen or read elsewhere. It gives an opportunity for better familiarity with Sanskrit.

  

However, I seek the views of scholars on the following usage, which appear to be using a regional idiom in Sanskrit

1\. In the first joke, when it was meant so and so looks after such and such department - in place of look after, take care of - पश्यति was used. In Hindi, I think देखिए and देखलीजिए is used for distinction. Is पश्यति appropriate. If not, what is a better substitute?

2. In the daughter-in-Law mother-in-law joke, the words ब्रह्मा समीप in एकदा चित्रगुप्त: ब्रह्मा समीप उक्तवान् looks like word by word translation from Tamil or some other regional language. Is it appropriate in Sanskrit?

The 'proximity' is used as an idiom some times in Hindi also - Do you have Rs.100 with you ?

आप की पास सौ रूपये हैं and mee daggire in Telugu and unkiTTe in Tamil etc. In one place I did see the word सन्निदौ in a similar context to convey 'with you' than actual proximity. Of course in Sri Lakshmi Kanta Sarma's Kamakshi Suprabhatam - तव भर्तु:कर्णमूले प्रणवपदविशेषम् बोधयमास - is used, the into the ear to show secrecy.

With reverence to all
