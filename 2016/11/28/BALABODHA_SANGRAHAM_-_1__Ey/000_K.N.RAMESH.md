A series of fundamental books on Sanatana Dharma under the title of BALABODHA SANGRAHAM is being authored by Pujya Sri Kumbakonam Swamigal in Samskrit and Tamil under the instructions of Sri Kanchi Acharyas and published by Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham.

They are being translated by me into English as instructed by the Acharyas.

  

BALABODHASANGRAHAM-1 is sent herewith. It has very useful information on basics of Dharma and the Advaita Vidya Guru Parampara.

  

BALABODHASANGRAHAM-2 was circulated by me sometime back.The book is a treasure of information on Advaita Vidyacharyas, Sanskrit poets and many other ancient fields of knowledge. The translated bookis available at:
