All,

  

 Members may like to know that the **Ganakashtadhyayi,**[**www.taralabalu.org**](http://www.taralabalu.org)****site, that went offline way back in 2008, is reborn.

  

I Quote***DrShivamurthy Swamiji***:

  

*"I am pleased to inform you that the long awaited new version of Ganakashtadhyayi 2016 (Ver 7.0.35) has been released and is made available on our website for free download as a Diwali gift to all the members and the public at large. Click the following link:
[www.taralabalu.org](http://www.taralabalu.org) and select the menu Softwares and click Gnakashtadhyayi. Follow the instructions given on the screen.*

*  
*

*This new release covers all the Sandhis (AC, Hal and Visarga Sandhis) and also the nominal stems (both Ajanta and Halanta) in all the genders.
It gives the derivational history of any word in all the cases and numbers in three different modes (Brief, Moderate and Details)."*

  

I have given it a quick once-over, and it's working well.

However, most sutra still lackan English rendering. Devanagari, Hindi, French, Romanised Sanskrit diacritics ... but little English for first language native English speakers.
