Thank you Professor,

  

 However, things easily get lost in translation across the continental divide.

  

I would understand व्याप्तौ to mean 'inherent', not 'spread'.

'Spread', to me, means something else entirely,and in no way does it equate to the more meaningful 'conventional' as provided in the bilingual book in question.

  

Whatever.

The knowledge gained from this discussion has inspired me to diminish my pounds sterling bank account by transferring a quantity of Rupees to Motilal Banarsidass to buy the Book.

  

Best Regards,
