Professor,

  

*as per **Nirukta**. Reasonable standard would be to derive where the roots could be traced to the noun directly to the meaning as per Panini's rules and a discussion is found in Nirukta on this point.* **Iti Professor**.

  

This must be the quote:

  

Those (nouns), such as cow, horse, man, elephant, etc. are conventional (terms and hence ***are underivable***).' (**Nir. 1.12**).  

  

*Conventions, of course, are dependent: on time and place, the influence of one's given ƒÅgama, **local guru...* Iti,Taff

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
