Professor,

  

*There is no need of deriving every noun deriving from root. iti*

*

 That man,**Panini** is the real root of all our pains (:-)

  

**Yaska**in his Nirukta has a better way with words:

  

***Don't memorize, seek the meaning***

Even so, by using the **TITUS Sanskrit retrieval engine**, to track down a source, since forum member **Sinu S**. doesn't provide a context,

I get ****

**  
**

 daśa puruṣe ***svarganarakāṇi***

 tāny enaṃ svargaṃ gatāni svargaṃ gamayanti **narakaṃ** gatāni **narakaṃ** gamayanti /

 ekādaśe 'nuvāke caturtʰaḥ kʰaṇḍaḥ //

  

 *Sama-Veda: Jaiminiya-Upanisad-Brahmana: SV, JUB, 4, 25* 

  

Which reads na+**r**+aka and not as yourna+aka,

- unless that r has come from another one of them**Panini**rules?



On Earth on least, Etymologists and Grammarians are eternally on the field of battle.
