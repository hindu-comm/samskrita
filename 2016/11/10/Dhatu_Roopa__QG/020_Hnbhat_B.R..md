The translation of vyāpti by pervasion is from vyāp = 

  

to reach or spread through, pervade from the verb aś will be the same.

  

This is the direction of the meaning of verbs in Dh.P

  

aś = vyāptau means the verb means act of pervading or spread through.

  

vyāpti as convensional noun technically defined as in Nyaya, gives the technical meaning as noted by you.

  

Sorry, if my translation is too literal, without the preposition.

  

Thank you
