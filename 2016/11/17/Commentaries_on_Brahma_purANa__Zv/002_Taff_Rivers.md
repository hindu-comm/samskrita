Nityanand,

  

 Your quotation has a different context to the Brahma Purāṇa.

It is from the different philosophical school of the Vedānta Purāṇa.

  

Hense the conflict in interpretation, perhaps.

  

For what it's worth, my searches for *tridaivatyā*in an English version of Brahma Purāṇa come up negative.

  

 Regards,
