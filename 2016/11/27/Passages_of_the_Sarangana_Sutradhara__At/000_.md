Hello, everybody.  
  
I would like to access to some passages of the Samarangana Sutradhara (in English, French, Spanish, Modern Greek or Italian…) because here in Spain it is not easy at all to find a copy of this book. I need it for a study about the raise of buddhist architecture, I need to read exactly S.S. 49, 56, 63.  
  
If you need some help with any Ancient Greek or Latin passage, I can help you as well.  
  
Thank you very much anyway. Best regards.  
  
José
