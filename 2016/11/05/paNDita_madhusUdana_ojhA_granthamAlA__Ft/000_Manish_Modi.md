No other ancient literature has been subjected to so many divergent interpretations as the Vedas. The authors of philosophical texts interpreted the Vedas in their own way. Some scholars emphasised the ritualistic aspect of the Vedas while others focused on the intellectual aspect. Heterodox scholars questioned the very authority of the Vedas. The four great Acaryas - Sayana, Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva each interpreted the Veda in their own way. Aurobindo and Dayananda Sarasvati read the Vedas in their own unique way. The result of all this wonderful attention given to Vedic study and interpretation is that the modern student is baffled by all the exegetical information available today. Each scholar seems to have perceived the Vedas differently.

  

The presence of many seemingly contradictory statements in the Vedas, Upanishads and Brahmanas, leads to divergent conclusions. Only one who has thoroughly studied all three - the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Brahmanas - shall be able to develop a nuanced understanding of these texts. The proliferation of technical terms in all these texts also adds to the confusion if they are not understood properly.

  

The Vedas, Upanishads and Brahmanas are interrelated. Studying one helps a deeper understanding of the other. A deeper study of the Brahmanas, in particular the section known as ‘Arthavada’ found in the Shatapatha Brahmana, is the key to proper understanding of the Vedas.

  

Few scholars have devoted their lives to a proper, contextual understanding of the above texts. Fewer still have studied them with an ecumenical spirit and an open mind.

  

Vidyavacaspati Pandit Madhusudan Ojha was one such person. He was a Vedic scholar applauded worldwide for his integrity and wisdom. His encyclopedic knowledge of the Vedas, Upanishads and Brahmanas as well as his enviable command of Sanskrit enabled him to gain true insight into the teachings of Veda Vyasa and other ancient seers. This, coupled with his extraordinary analytical ability ensured that Pt Ojha did great justice to the Vedas and made an invaluable contribution to our understanding of them.

  

Pt Ojha was a formidable scholar of Sanskrit and wrote exclusively in Sanskrit. However, his close disciples Motilal Sharma, Giridhar Sharma and Surjandas Svami translated his writings in Hindi for the common man. Thus, Pt Ojha’s writings are published in Sanskrit + Hindi. The original text in Sanskrit, written by Ojha is given first, followed by a lucid Hindi translation.
