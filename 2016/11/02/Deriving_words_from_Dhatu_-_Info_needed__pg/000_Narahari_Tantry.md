Namaste,

  

I have been studing vyakarana since last six months and have knowledge about pratyayas for Namapada and tinantas etc.

However I would like to know if there is any book or grantha which gives the moola dhatu of words.Currently I am refering to Shabda kalpa druma, but is there a way to form words by adding pratyayas to moola dhatus.Where do i get this information.I am talking of Basic form of word , not tadhita,krudanta etc  For example as below.

**(१) कृ**(करना)

**संज्ञा**: कार्य, उपकरण, कर्मन्, प्रक्रिया

  

Here all the above words are formed by adding relevent pratyayas and upsargas.How were those words created i want to know.

Or Is there commemtary on Amarakosha where mool dhatu for words is mentioned.

  

My requirement is simple: Is there a book(I can understand sanskrit) or technique which lists pratyayas to derive words by applying those on Dhatu.

Please pardon me if requirement is lame.I am only starting out into magnanimous vast ocean of Vyakarana. My humble request for knowledgeable to guide me regarding this.

  

Thanks

Narahari
