Dear list

  

I am looking for Unicode text of Devi Bhagavatam (Devanagari or IAST would do). Does anybody have it or know of a website that hosts it?

  

The Satsangdhara site has the entire text in Unicode with a Marathi translation but over 319 html files. I could write a shell script to lynx dump all html files (or wget and convert html to text), isolate Sanskrit part from Marathi, and then combine all files into one. But if somebody already has the entire text in Unicode, I would rather not.
