Dear Taff/Eddie

  

Have you read the book? If not, I suggest you please read the book and then comment whether the writing by Malhotra (or my review of it) is emotive or logical. Malhotra's book as I have noted is more a motivational book than an academic book. However, it does have reason and logic, not that it is not there. Whether the logic or reason is strong enough to convince people is a different thing. If you see subsection 4 in my paper, as many as eight Indian and international scholars of Sanskrit and Indian studies who have authored or edited close to 200 books put together have endorsed the book. Some of them have even co-opted Malhotra's terminology. The appreciation by academics shows that the book is not entirely emotive or to be debated in Indian Parliament.

  

Please do read the comments of Dilip Chakrabarti in subsection 3.4 of my review.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
