This is composed by KalIdasa.

  

The original story of Sak/unthala is in Mahabharatha.

  

Kalidasa added some story of a ring taking it from ValmIkI Ramayana.

  

Here Rama gives his ring to Hanuman to identify to Sita that he is the

messnger from Rama.

  

ददौ तस्य ततः प्रीतः स्व नामांक उपशोभितम् \|  
अंगुलीयम् अभिज्ञानम् राजपुत्र्याः परंतपः \|\| ४-४४-१२  

  

In Abhijnana Sakunthalam Dushyanta gave his ring to Sakunthala.

The angry-prone Durvasa arrives whenShakuntala is lost in herfantasies.Soshe fails to attend to him, and he curses her bybewitching Dushyanta into forgetting her existence. The only cure for Sankutala is toshow him the signet ring  

She is given a ring by the king, to be presented to him when she appears in his court. She can then claim her place as queen.

The anger-prone sage[Durvasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durvasa "Durvasa")arrives when Shakuntala is lost in her fantasies, so that when she fails to attend to him, he curses her by bewitching Dushyanta into forgetting her existence. The only cure is for Shakuntala to show him the[signet ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring "Signet ring")that he gave her.

  

Kalidasa has taken the idea from Ramayana the ring and abhijnanam.
