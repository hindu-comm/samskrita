Abhyankarji,

  

I write this to specifically state that I very much appreciate the novel ideas you throw out from time to time in the matter of study of Sanskrit. I am not a professional Sanskritist. My knowledge of Sanskrit grammar does not extend to Panini, so I cannot comment upon what you are doing here but do feel that I must put on record my appreciation of you desire to work.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
