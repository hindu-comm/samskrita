SL.

  

 Something that would indeed be useful, would be an annotated Structure Chart of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.

 Normally developed from a general idea - and sheets of blank white paper.

  

 Quite a strenuous mental task.

  

 However, with that mental work already done, as in this case and fully expressed on the paper in words, Reverse Engineering a chart from those words is a routine matter.

  

 These are everyday tasks for Software engineers who often have to work with undocumented spaghetti-like program instructions.

  

 I would love the challenge, but for a slight handicap regarding the writings of a certain ancient language.
