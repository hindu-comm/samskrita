नमस्ते सीताराम-महोदय !

Thanks for the information on totals by six types of सूत्र-s. As mentioned in the post, the bar chart is prepared by focusing on only 23 अधिकार-सूत्राणि as advocated by पं. ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासुin his book. When I prepared the chart, I was impressed byपं. ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु's selection of the23 अधिकार-सूत्राणि, such that the command-ranges of these 23 अधिकार-सूत्राणि cover *almost* the whole of अष्टाध्यायी. By that one gets a good at-a-glance view of अष्टाध्यायी. One does not get any such view by merely knowing that अष्टाध्यायी has eight अध्याय-s with four पाद-s in each अध्याय.

  

At least for myself I got a good at-a-glance view of अष्टाध्यायी, which I had never had before. I guess anyone who is new to अष्टाध्यायी, would get sort of a head-start on अष्टाध्यायी by such at-a-glance view. Crux lies inपं. ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु's selection of the23 अधिकार-सूत्राणि and the at-a-glance view obtained by my outlining their command-ranges in the bar-chart.
