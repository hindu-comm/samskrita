There is no harm in running such exercise howeverI can not see the benefit of it can you please elaborate?

For example (These number does not mean anything I just put to get my point across)

1\. Sangya sutras = 170

2\. Adhirakara sutra = 535

3\. Paribhasha sutra = 100

4\. vidhi - 1850

5\. NIyama- 1090

6\. atidesha - 250

  

let say based on above numbers you created a Bar chart or pie chart. whats the use of that?? its not going to help anyone understand the structure.

If you can elaborate your rationale to undertake this tas, it would be great.

Thanks

Raama
