Margie,

  

I tried to understand the meaning of the verse quoted by you:

  

कालमानं त्रिधा ज्ञेयं चान्द्रं सौरं च सावनम् ।

भृतिदाने सदा सौरं चान्द्रं कौसीदवृद्धिषु ।

कल्पयेत् सावनं नित्यं दिनभृत्येऽवधौ सदा ॥

  

The commentary of Jeevananda Vidyasagara on this is as under:

  

कालस्य मानं परिमाणं त्रिधा ज्ञेयम्, चान्द्रं चन्द्रवृद्ध्यावधिकं शुक्लप्रतिपदादिरूपमित्यर्थ:, सौरं संक्रमणदिनावधिकं, सावनं उत्पत्तिदिनावधिकं च। भृत्या वेतनस्य दाने सदा सौरं, कौसीदवृद्धिषु ऋणव्यवहारेष्वित्यर्थ: नित्यं चान्द्रं, दिनभृत्ये दैनिकपरिचारके अवधौ च सदा सावनं कल्पयेत्।:

  

I understand the verse as follows: the चान्द्र measure - परिमाण - of time is counted from शुक्लप्रतिपदा and is thus the lunar months of चैत्र, वैशाख etc. The amount of interest payable on a deposit increases with the passage of चान्द्र months. The payment of salary for service is paid, not by the चान्द्र months but by the transits of the Sun from one राशि to another, called in Indian Astronomy/Astrology as संक्रमण.
The wages of daily workers are paid by theसावन दिन or the Civil Day.

  

Different outcomes follow from the use ofचान्द्र परिमाण or सौर परिमाण.
It is known from 'Meton's Cycle' that 14 सौर years of 228 सौर months are equal in length to 235 चान्द्र months. (The need for insertion of an intercalary months roughly every 3 years arises form this fact, so as to keep the lunar and solar calendars in synch.) Thus a permanent servant will be paid 228 salaries in 14 years but interest payable per month on a deposit will be paid 235 times in the same period. The time of service of a daily-wager is for a day and he is to be paid by the day. For him the complication of चान्द्र or सौर months is not relevant.

  

I would like to know how you construe the quoted verse.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
