Pranam, Shri. Kolhatkar,

  

I have not been able to work further on this topic since my query. But I since I do not know much about the differences in calendars, my general approach would have been similar to what you suggest:

  

1\. Arrive at the largest common divisor, and find out how many durations of each would be included therein.

2\. Determine how many salaries, periodic interest payments, and equivalent of wages by daily method would have to be paid under each

3\. Verify if what is suggested is actually working out to be the best as quoted in the shloka.

  

Thank you!
