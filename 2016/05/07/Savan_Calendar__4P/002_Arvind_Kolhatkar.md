Aसावन day is the interval of time between two successive risings of the Sun. This is also called the 'civil day'. This period varies in length, according to the season. The average of all such days in a year is called as the 'mean civil day' orमध्य सावन दिन and is divided into 60 घटिका or 24 होरा.

  

the wordसावन is derived fromसवन, a collective name for morning, noon and evening as also for the three religious bathings associated with these periods.
