Dear Friends ,

  

There is one more type of year . The duration when the sun returns to the same point on earth is called as tropical solar year . This is 365.2524 days . But the due to the wobble of the earth , the duration when the sun returns to the same point on earth \*with respect to \* the stars is called as sidereal solar year . The sidereal solar year is about 20 minutes different from the tropical solar year . Hope this helps .

  

  

  

  
  
  
Regards ,
