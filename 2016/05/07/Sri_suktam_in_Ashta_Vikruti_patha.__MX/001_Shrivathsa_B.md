hariH OM,

What is so special in the mantra that you think vikRRiti isn't possible?

Are you familiar with saMhitaa pATha for you to be asking for its vikRRitis?

One is at a loss to know how one can learn intricacies of saMhitaa, leave alone vikRRitis through audio recordings.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.

Shrivathsa.
