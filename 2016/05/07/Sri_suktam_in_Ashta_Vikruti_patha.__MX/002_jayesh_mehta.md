Namaskaram !

  

I have recvd below mentioned message from one of the person.

  

{Only a portion of the vedas (typically the samhita) is recited in vikritis like the ghanapatha. In the case of the shri sukta -- which is a rig veda khila sukta -- even the swaras in the samhita patha were likely lost and re-added at a later time. There are many violations of standard vedic swara rules in popular renditions.

  

If "Panch sandhi" refers to the popular five शान्ति mantras, these are also not recited in vikriti form}  
  
I am familiar with Samhita Patha of Sri suktam but new learner to Vedas.  
  
Regards,

  

Jayesh  
  
  

  

Thanks
