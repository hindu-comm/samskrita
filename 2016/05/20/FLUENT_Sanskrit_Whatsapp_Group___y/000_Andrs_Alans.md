Hello everyone.  
My purpose is to reach fluency in the Sanskrit Language by the end of the year. I am aiming towards B2 Level (According to European Language Classification). I began my Sanskrit studies since last year and now I am only beginning to understand oral speech (Interviews in Vartavali Tv Show and the daily DD News). I struggle with basic sentences so I need to practice my oral skills as well in order to create the appropriate motor neural circuits. I began a Sanskrit whatsapp group last month with some friends here in Mexico. A new Indian fellow has been added. He is currently working in India, he is in charge on making materials to learn sanskrit (images, videos, tables, conversation examples, etc). He is very friendly and eager to help. He is fluent and speaks sanskrit everyday at his job with his workmates. He is very serious in teaching sanskrit at a fluent level.  
  
In the group, he posts images that help in the sanskrit study, I send voice messages about conversations I read out loud, or questions and sentences out of my own. We write in devanagari. Our time zones are different so an instant reply is not expected, rather each one of us answers or participate on their own pace, when you have available time during the day or the next day. No hurries. Nevertheless, we are online at the same time often so real conversations can take place. I also post voice messages overshadowing interviews of vartavali and some news to practice my oral skills and in order to be corrected by him if I make mistakes. I just book about 13 books in sanskrit, including the sankrit version of "The Little Prince". I post a pic of a page and send a voice message of me reading it. Again, looking for corrections in my pronounciations.  
  
The general idea is to be learning this marvellous language without a formal structure. Some of my mexican friends are just beginning so they are there to listen and to get a background of the language. They omit the "difficult" questions.  
  
Sometimes I plan skype conversations with my Indian Sanskrit-fluent friend to practice in a more one-to-one session.  
  
If you are interested in joining the group tell me and I'm be glad to add you. As I said, the general mood-theme is a friendly one, so respect is mandatory. Even if some friends ask very "easy" questions we should answer respectfully.  
  
Cheers!  
Saludos desde México.
