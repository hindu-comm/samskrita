Namaste!  
  
I would like to know if there exist any data regarding the articulatory duration of different phonemes in Sanskrit. How similar or different is the articulatory duration when compared with other languages written in Devanagari? Also, is there any data regarding the articulatory duration of different phonemes in Hindi?  
  
Thank you in advance.
