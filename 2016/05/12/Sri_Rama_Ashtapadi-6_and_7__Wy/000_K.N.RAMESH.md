Some virtuous man contemplates with love in his heart on Rama, who shines with his neck yellowed with turmeric; his wrist displaying the marriage vow string and bracelet; with the shining ritual silk dresses even more glorified by the fragrances used by Janaki; who is in beautiful marriage attire.

Some virtuous man contemplates with love in his heart on Rama, who is seated in front of the altar in the marriage hall among groups of Rishis; who is handsome, followed by Bharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna in marriage attire.

Some virtuous man contemplates with love in his heart on Rama, who is honoured by waving the lighted lamp studded with the nine precious gems by aged sumangali (whose husbands are alive) women; who relieved Janaka of his inexorable worry by breaking the matchless Siva’s bow.

Some virtuous man contemplates with love in his heart on Rama, who is adored by heaps of Kalpaka flowers, dropped by Devas with grace on the occasion of his marriage with Janaki; who is in the palace, in the midst of chiming sound of musical instruments played by Narada, Tumburu and all Gandharvas.

(रामं)

Some virtuous man contemplates with love in his heart on Rama, who shines with his smooth dark body glorified with application of freshly prepared dense camphor; like a stream full of flowing water, flowing in zigzag manner, and beautified with the dense rays of the moon.

Some virtuous man contemplates with love in his heart on Rama, who is happily surrounded by the exclamations of Deva women singing ‘Gowri Kalyanam’; whose feet are decorated by the edges of the gem-studded crowns of kings who prostrate.

 (रामं)

May this auspicious song on Sri Raghupati’s marriage by the great poet Sri Ramakavi be sung every day in homes, giving rise to continuous festivity every day.



श्लॊ ॥ याते गाधिसुते वनं रघुपतिःपित्रादिभि-स्स्वां पुरीं

 कुब्जा-विघ्नवशा-दरण्य-गमनेऽप्यासीत् समानस्थितिः ॥

Slokas

After sage Viswamitra left for the forest, Raghupati, accompanied by his parents and others, left for Ayodhya. On the way, he robbed Parasurama of his conceit. In Ayodhya, people were very happy. His father Dasaratha, who was enchanted by the virtues of Rama, nominated him as Crown Prince (Yuvaraja). Then owing to the obstacle created by the hunch-backed woman (Manthara), Rama had to go to forest. However he retained equanimity in both these conditions.



 सीतां वना-नुगमनाय पुरः प्रवृत्तां

 प्रीत्या निवर्तयितु-माजनुष-स्सुखार्हाम् ।

 वस्तव्यतां प्रति वने बहुदॊष-जातं

 भीतिप्रदं मृगदृशां निजगाद रामः ॥

When Sita was eager to accompany Rama to the forest, Rama spoke to her on the many dangers in forest life including the terror of animals, with a view to dissuading her from the idea of proceeding to the forest, keeping in mind her high birth and comfortable living.



 सरयू-सैकतॊद्यान-सञ्चारेऽप्यतिखॆदिनौ ।

 चरणौ तॆ महारण्ये कथं दॆवि भविष्यतः ॥

Devi, in the great forest, what will happen to your feet, which feel very miserable even in the sands of Sarayu river and the gardens.

***In this Ashtapadi, the great poet Ramakavi draws an enchanting word-picture of the grand marriage celebration of Rama with Sita. He makes a quick reference to his encounter with Parasurama. The much acclaimed equanimity of Rama, when told to accept the position of Yuvaraja and then to go to the forest for fourteen long years, is beautifully and succinctly brought out by the poet. Valmiki refers to this state of mind of a Sthitapragna (one whose awareness is ever steady) in many slokas, one of which is:***

***उचितं च महाबहुर्न जहौ हर्षं-आत्मवान् ।***

***शारदः समुदीर्णांशुश्-चन्द्रस्-तेज इवात्मजम् ॥*****

***“The valorous Rama, who always had control on his mind, never left his natural happy disposition, just as the moon of shining rays of autumn does not leave its natural radiance.” (2:19:37)***

Humble woman, the forest life – with sleeping at the foot of tree; eating food of no taste, that too, at the close of day; wearing bark of tree, that too, of unsuitable size and shape- is not at all suitable for you.

In the forest you will continuously experience suffering due to severe conditions. Your body is much more delicate than the flower of the Sirisha tree. The forest is not suitable for you.

O beloved, accept whatever has been told to you by this Rama as it is in your interest. Change your mind immediately, o woman of slight belly. The forest is not suitable for you.

Slokas

The charioteer Sumantra seated in the chariot, Raghupati, who had been cheated by Kaikeyi in the guise of boons (given by his father) and dispatched to the forest by his father. Rama was accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana. Sumantra crossed many towns and villages and reached the shore of Ganga, where Guha, who was strong and would become the friend of Rama, lived.



 ततस्सुमन्त्रं नितरां रुदन्त-माश्वास्य रामः पितृ-गौरवॆण ।

 भार्या-नुजाभ्यां वनमेव गन्तुं तदाभवत् तापस-वॆषधारी ॥

Rama consoled Sumantra, who was crying very much, with the respect due to his father. With the appearance of an austere man in penance, he proceeded towards the forest along with his wife and younger brother.



 तं तया कान्तयारण्ये वस्तुं दशरथॊ गतम् ।

 रामं विचिन्त्य हृदये तत्याज धृतिमात्मनः ॥

Dasaratha was worried in his heart about Rama, who had gone away for living in the forest, together with his beloved wife, and lost his steadiness.

******

***In this Ashtapadi poet Ramakavi has employed the ‘bhayanaka’ (fearsome) rasa with telling effect. Rama’s repeated and deft reference to the delicateness of Sita’s form is to accentuate the fear of the forest and heighten the pathos in the situation. The poet’s jump to Rama’s departure to the forest along with Sita and Lakshmana is an indirect pointer to Sita’s successful persuasion with Rama for accompanying him to the forest. Even in the brief narration of events, Sri Ramakavi does not fail to mention the great respect due to father shown by Rama towards the aged Sumantra, the minister and charioteer.***
