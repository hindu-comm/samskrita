Dear Sanskrit scholars,

  

When wishing someone on birthday, we use "जीवेत शरदः शतम" and also many use "जीवेम शरदः शतम". I think both should be correct but which one can be used when? As per my understanding, जीवेत शरदः शतम can be used to wish someone "You live for 100 years" while जीवेम शरदः शतम can be used for "We live for 100 years". Is that correct?

  

Thanks in advance for your time.

  

Best regards,

Ashvin Ambaliya
