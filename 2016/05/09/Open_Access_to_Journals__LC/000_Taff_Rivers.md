All,

  

  When searching for knowledge on the web's journals, coming up against the '*payment required to access articl*e' restriction, can be quite frustrating.

  

  However, there is joy to be had at the **DOAJ**\* organisation.

  

##   \*Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)

##      an online directory that indexes and provides access to high quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals.

  

     <https://doaj.org>  

  

  

   One does not even have to undergo the hassle of registering.

  

  Happy hunting!
