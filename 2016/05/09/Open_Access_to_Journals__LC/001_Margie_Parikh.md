... also, sometimes I get the free author versions or author-paid Open Access papers on Google Scholar:

  

<https://scholar.google.com>

  

Although it doesn't help 100% of the times, but I have seen that most of the work considered seminal is accessible.

Further, if you have a Jstor account (www.jstor.org/), and if they have a relevant paper in their database, they allow you to add up to three papers to your 'shelf', and you can read them online for free.

  

Best wishes,
