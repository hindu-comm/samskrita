hi everyone,

  

i am working on creating a platform where the rich indology information could be created as self paced videos supported by sufficient materials.

the idea behind this thought is that there are many people who would like to gain the knowledge in indology however the access to people who could teach is still limited.

so an online platform could help. the beta version of the platform is in the works.

  

let me know your thoughts.

  

regards,

rakesh
