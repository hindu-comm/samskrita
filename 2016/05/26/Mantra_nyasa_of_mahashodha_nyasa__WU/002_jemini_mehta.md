Thank you so much for your reply.  
But this link <http://www.shivashakti.com/shodha.htm> gives details about laghu shodha nyasa though the name given is maha shodha.  
Because this nyasa is about ganesha, planets, constellations, yogini etc. Which is laghu shodha nyasa.  
In maha shodha nyasa you can find murti nyasa, mantra nyasa, matrka bhairav nyasa etc.  
  
Please reply to my first post.
