Respected members,  
I want to know how to do mantra nyasa mentioned in maha shodha nyasa.  
I am following Sri vidya Ratnakara book  
I am unable to understand following words from it.  
  
Murti Nyasa:  
Ardhendu  
Rodhinyam  
Nade  
Nadante  
Bindau  
  
Mantra nyasa  
Shaktau  
Vyapikayam  
Semana sthane  
Unmaniyam  
Dhruvmandale  
  
I also don't know how to do mantra nyasa whether we need to touch any part of body or its inner one(we just need to chant mantra?)  
  
Please suggest.  
  
Thanks and Regards,  
Jemini Mehta
