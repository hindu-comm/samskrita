The Upamiti-Bhava-Prapanca Katha is an allegorical work, comprising of 16000 verses composed in the anushtupa metre. It was written by Siddharshi Gani in the 10th century, CE.

It is an outstanding text, even by the standards of Classical Sanskrit literature.

  

Prof Hermann Jacobi described it as being the first allegorical novel found in Indian literature. It precedes both, John Bunyan’s ‘The Pilgrim’s Progress’ (17th century) and the less well known ‘The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man’ (14th century) by Guillaume de Deguileville; by several centuries.

  

Introduction

  

This is a metaphorical text where the chief protagonist experiences the trials and tribulations of worldly life in a state of awareness. The author has personified abstract concepts and made them comprehensible to the lay reader.

  

The enduring strength of this novel is its relevance even today. Each of the travails that Anusundara undergoes, are as real today as they were a thousand years ago. It is human nature to feel anger, arrogance, artifice and avarice and this is as true in the Microsoft Age as it was in the Stone Age.

  

The Plot

  

This allegorical novel moves on two levels, the temporal and the spiritual.

  

At the temporal level, it is the story of the the key protagonist Cakravarti Anusundara, and what he undergoes in his worldly sojourn. Used to living in the fast lane, Anusundara experiences the full gamut of human emotions and has to endure the most extreme vicissitudes. 

  

At the spiritual level, the reader finds that the travails of human life are merely an expression of the dynamic interaction between various life forms. The reader is invited to form his/her own conclusions vis-a-vis the viability of a life spent in the pursuit of material wealth.

  

The author is skilful enough to ensure that his reader stays on the roller coaster of emotions, exulting in Anusundara’s victories and grieving his losses. Simultaneously, he inculcates the message of awareness, insight and detachment, through which the seeker may attain freedom from the cycle of rebirth and death.

  

This novel traces the worldly journey of Anusundara through several births until he attains moksha.
