śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Lord said;mayi—unto Me;āsakta-manāḥ—mind attached;pārtha—O son of Pṛthā;yogam—self-realization;yuñjan—so practicing;mat-āśrayaḥ—in consciousness of Me (Kṛṣṇa consciousness);asaṁśayam—without doubt;samagram—completely;mām—unto Me;yathā—as much as;jñāsyasi—you can know;tat—that;śṛṇu—try to hear.

TRANSLATION

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4519)

Now hear, O son of Pṛthā \[Arjuna\], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4520)

PURPORT

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4521)

In this Seventh Chapter ofBhagavad-gītā,the nature of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is fully described. Kṛṣṇa is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to Kṛṣṇa, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to Kṛṣṇa are described in this chapter.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4522)

In the first six chapters ofBhagavad-gītā,the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types ofyogas.At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Kṛṣṇa, or in other words Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the highest form of allyoga.By concentrating one's mind upon Kṛṣṇa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonalbrahmajyotior localized Paramātmā realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kṛṣṇa, and everything is revealed to the person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness one knows that Kṛṣṇa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types ofyogaare only steppingstones on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who takes directly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness automatically knows aboutbrahmajyotiand Paramātmā in full. By practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousnessyoga,one can know everything in full-namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4523)

One should therefore beginyogapractice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kṛṣṇa the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of whichśravaṇamis the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, "tat śṛṇu," or "Hear from Me." No one can be a greater authority than Kṛṣṇa, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One has therefore to learn from Kṛṣṇa directly or from a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa-and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4524)

In theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatamthis process of understanding Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4525)

śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāṁ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ  
hṛdyantaḥstho hy abhadrāṇi vidbunoti suhṛt satām.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4526)

naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā  
bhagavaty uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4527)

tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhadayaś ca ye  
ceta etair anāviddhaṁ sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4528)

evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ  
bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ mukta-saṅgasya jāyate.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4529)

bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ  
kṣīyante cāsya karmāṇi dṛṣṭa evātmanīśvare.

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4530)

"To hear about Kṛṣṇa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through theBhagavad-gītā,is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about Kṛṣṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is dwelling in everyone's heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kṛṣṇa from theBhāgavatamand from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thusbhakti-yogasevers the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of'asaṁśayaṁ samagram,'understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead."(Bhāg.[1.2.17](http://asitis.com/7/1.html?g=6478)-21)

[](http://asitis.com/7/1.html#4531)

Therefore only by hearing from Kṛṣṇa or from His devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can one understand the science of Kṛṣṇa.

That the highest conception ofyogaperfection is Kṛṣṇa consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And, unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durvāsā Muni picked a quarrel with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, and Durvāsā Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful ayogīas the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage's injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The King was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam:

"King Ambarīṣa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting thetulasīleaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to become amat-paraḥdevotee of the Lord."(Bhāg.[9.4.18](http://asitis.com/2/61.html?g=68603)-20)

[](http://asitis.com/2/61.html#1811)

The wordmat-paraḥis most significant in this connection. How one can become amat-paraḥis described in the life of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great scholar andācāryain the line of themat-paraḥ,remarks:"mad-bhakti-prabhāvena sarvendriya-vijaya-pūrvikā svātma dṛṣṭiḥ sulabheti bhāvaḥ.""The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa." Also the example of fire is sometimes given: "As the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Viṣṇu, situated in the heart of theyogī,burns up all kinds of impurities." TheYoga-sūtraalso prescribes meditation on Viṣṇu, and not meditation on the void. The so-calledyogīswho meditate on something which is not the Viṣṇu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Kṛṣṇa conscious-devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the realyoga.
