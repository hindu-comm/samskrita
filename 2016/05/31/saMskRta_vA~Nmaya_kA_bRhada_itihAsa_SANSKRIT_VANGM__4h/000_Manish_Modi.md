The pre-Classical form of Sanskrit is known as Vedic Sanskrit, with the language of the RigVeda being the oldest and most archaic stage preserved, its oldest core dating back to as far back as 1500 BCE or earlier. This qualifies RigVedic Sanskrit as one of the oldest examples of any Indo-Iranian language, and one of the earliest attested members of the Indo-European languages, the family which includes Sanskrit with English and most European languages.

  

Classical Sanskrit is one of the oldest languages to emerge from India. Preceded only by Vedic Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali and Sangam Tamil, Classical Sanskrit was the lingua franca of Indian elite for centuries.

  

Right until the Islamic conquest of India, Sanskrit was not only the medium of expression for the arts and philosophies but also the administrative language.

Classical Sanskrit is the standard register as laid out in the grammar of Panini, around the 4th century BCE. Its position in the cultures of Greater India is akin to that of Latin and Greek in Europe and it has significantly influenced most modern languages of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

  

Sanskrit was spoken in an oral society, and the oral tradition was maintained through the development of early classical Sanskrit literature. When it was written, the choice of writing system was influenced by the regional scripts of the scribes.

  

Therefore, Sanskrit has no native script of its own. As such, virtually all of the major writing systems of South Asia have been used in writing Sanskrit manuscripts. Since the late 19th century, Devanagari has become the de facto standard writing system for Sanskrit publication, quite possibly because of the European practice of printing Sanskritic texts in this script.

  

The oldest written inscription in India appears on the famous Prakrit pillar inscriptions of king Ashoka. These were in Prakrit, written in the Brahmi script. These were written in the 3rd century BCE. The earliest South Indian inscriptions in Tamil Brahmi, written in Sangam Tamil, belong to the same period.

  

The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit date to the 1st century BCE. They are in the Brahmi script.

  

When Sanskrit was written down, it was first used for texts of an administrative, literary or scientific nature. Religious texts were transmitted orally, through the guru-shishya parampara.
