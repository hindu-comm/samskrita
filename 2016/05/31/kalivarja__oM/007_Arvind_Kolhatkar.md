My thanks to Sunder for these valuable leads.

  

(Incidentally, the happy state of cooperation from DLI's newly revamped opening page, which lasted till yesterday, appears to be transitory.
Till yesterday, upon conducting a search, I could see a link to a pdf file and I could download that. Today, you only see the result of the search but there is no pdf after that! Also, since bar-codes are not seen, I cannot use the downloader that was the main tool used earlier for accessing DLI books. Users can only hope that the current unhappy state will pass with the passage of time.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
