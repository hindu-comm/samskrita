Dear members

  

I am aware that the literal translation of a tantric text may not show the deeper meaning of the work. However, even the literal meaning of this verse is obscure to me. In particular, the compound in red:

  

कर्णिकारं महद्यन्त्रं षट्कोणं वज्रकीलकम्.

षड्अङ्गषट्पदीस्थानं प्रकृत्या पुरुषेण च .5.3.

  

The only comment that I have found is to Jiva Goswami.  

Are there any other comments of this work?  

  

Thank you very much  

valerio
