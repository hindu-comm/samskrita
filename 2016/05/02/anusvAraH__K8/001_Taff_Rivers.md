> 

> > • mfn. nasal, uttered through the nose (as one of the five nasal > > consonants, or a vowel, or the three semivowels y, v, l, under > > certain circumstances; in the case of vowels and semivowels, the > > mark ँ is used to denote this nasalization). >
> > • the nasal mark. >
> > • (am), n. a nasal twang. >
> > • speaking through the nose (a fault in pronunciation). \[34,1\]
