महेशाम्सात् जात:मधुरम् उपतिष्ठाद्वय नय:

महामोहद्वान्त प्रचमन रवि:षण्मतगुरु: \|

फले स्वस्मिन्स्वायुषि शरचराब्देअपिचकलेर्

विलिल्ये रक्ताक्षिन्यतिव्रुष सितैकादशि परे \|\|

  

please correct the above sloka as I just typed it from tamil version given at<http://www.kamakoti.org/tamil/d-san115.htm>

  

This is mentioned in the punya zloka manjari book which speaks about the peetaadhipati's siddhi dates.

  

The key word is शरचर in the above sloka which gives the number of 5262 as per katapayadi. This when reversed gives 2625, which means Acharyal attained sidhi after 2625 years since kali yuga started on an ekadashi day in Raktaakshi year.

  

kali was born in 3102 BC, so after 2625 years means it is 477 BC.

  

Age is mentioned in the word फले which is 23, after reversal gives 32.

  

I have just translated the message given in the hyperlink above.

  

I am not here to debate the age & siddhi date of Adishankara, as various opinions are there.

  

My requests are:

  

1\) Please verify the above sloka & give the correct version.

2\) If some one has the book punya zloka manjari , please share.

  

namaskarams
