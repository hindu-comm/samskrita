Dear All:

  

10 Years+ Already, my Java Devanagari Transliterator was first made online.

  

I just revamped it into a Gradle-Groovy enabled JAR and made the following important Change:

  

Formerly Input from One Encoding only was possible to Devanagari and IAST.

  

Now, I have made all Encodings transliterable to All Other Encodings.

  

The New JAR File can be downloaded from below:

  

<https://github.com/eGangotri/indicTools/tree/master/jarLocation>

  

Only a Java Runtime Engine 8 or above is needed.

  

Code as usual is available at:

  

<https://github.com/eGangotri/indicTools>

.

The eGangotri Transliterator currently supports the following encodings:

  

1\. ITRANS

2\. SLP-1

3\. Harvard Kyoto

4\. Velthuis

5\. Unicode Devanagari

6\. IAST

  

I will be happy to incorporate more encodings if someone can prove there widespread usage.

  

Hindi Phonetic encoding such as by uninagari is also in my mind. I wonder if a standard has been established somewhere which I can follow.

  

Screenshot with Velthuis transliterated to Devanagari and IAST can be seen attached.

  

Velthuis Text is courtesy of Muktabodha.

  

Similar revamping of my Sandhi Engine, Pratyahara Decoder and Monier Williams Dictionary shall be done over the weeks and I will be releasing them in GitHub also.

  

Infact after seeing so many stardict dictionaries, I realize most of the Data of Apte, Cologne and other dictionaries are already in a Independent DB.

  

I can expand my Monier Williams to incorporate all the Several Dictionaries available - untilI discover or if someone already knows how to convert the stardict format into MySQL.

  

stardict's serious handicap is inability to view/input Devanagari which my Dictionary addresses

  

The Web Version of these inside a Embedded Jetty is also planned.

  

Thanks and Regards,
