Manda,

  

 As you have been advised, the word is an adverb, not a verb.

  

Furthermore śrad has an alternative form,*śrat,* having the sense of*'truth, faithfulness';*

butonly in comp. with √ kṛ and dāna and √ dhā and its derivations,

*  
*

śrad-dadhāna

 • mfn. having faith, trustful, believing, ṚV. &c. &c.

  

  

Hope this clears things up for you.
