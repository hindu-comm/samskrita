Many historical linguists have commented that श्रद्-धा literally means "to place in the heart." श्रद् is said to be cognate with हृद्. The reasoning behind this comes from cognate verbs such ascrēdō ("I believe") in Latin. The parallel becomes clearer when by seeing forms such as crēdidī, which show it is formed by a suffix cre(d) (cf. cor ) added to the verbdō ("I give"), which is cognate with दा दाने.  
  
(The roots दा and धा are said to be merged in Latin, due to the lack of महाप्राणाs in the language. This explains the substitution of धा (धारणपोषणयोः) with dō (दाने) ).
