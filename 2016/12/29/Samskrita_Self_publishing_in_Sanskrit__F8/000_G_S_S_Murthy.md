Dear Scholars,

I am attempting self-publishing a book of my poems in Sanskrit. Although there is much information available on the internet, I have some gray areas. There may be several among you who have experience in this area and who are willing to help me and throw light on my gray areas. I request them to contact me directly at [murt...@gmail.com](). As this is not of general interest I should not waste the precious time and space of this group.

I apologise for cross-posting.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
