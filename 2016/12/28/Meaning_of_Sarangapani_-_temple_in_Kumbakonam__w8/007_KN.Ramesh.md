Slightly off the topic ,in carnatic music there is a raga called saarangaa. heard the word saaranga means having all the colors.. as told by Violinist Sriram parasuram in one of his lecture demonstrations in IIT, Chennai.

  

How to interpret saaranga here?

Can we say having all angas ( saara ang - in hindi)?
