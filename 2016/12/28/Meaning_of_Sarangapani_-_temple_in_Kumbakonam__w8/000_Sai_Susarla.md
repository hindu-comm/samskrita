There is a temple called "Sarangapani' in Kumbakonam of sheSha-shaayi viShNu.  
  

But I thought sAraNGga-pANi means shiva - one who holds a deer in his hand.  
  

What is the meaning of saaranga-paaNi that connects it to Vishnu?  

Is it a distortion of shaarnga-paaNi (one who wields the shaarnga-dhanu)?  

\- Sai.
