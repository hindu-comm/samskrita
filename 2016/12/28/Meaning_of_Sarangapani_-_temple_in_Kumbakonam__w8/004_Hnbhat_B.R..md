In fact, for शा and सा there is one letter "cha" read in both ways. And in conjunct letter, epenthesis a is added "a:" is added. Hence शार्ङ्ग will be read as सारङ्ग creating confusion and it is already cleared by Mr. Nagaraja. In this case it is used for विष्णु as already mentioned by Sarala. It is possibility confirmed as the Tamil pronoiunciation is common for both.
