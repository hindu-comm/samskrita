In Tamil script, श and स may be represented by same alphabet, even though the pronunciation is different for these two letters. Equally, one may observe that in Tamil it is very rare for three consonants tooccur together without an intervening vowel. This causes matra (time duration of pronounciation)difference in Tamil when you vocalize one of the consonants (र). Then "Sharnga" and "Saaranga" both have same matra duration and sound similar
