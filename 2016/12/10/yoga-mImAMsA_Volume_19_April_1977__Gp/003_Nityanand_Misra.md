Thanks Ajit Ji. For those who may be interested, I purchased the digital archive from Kaivalya Dhama for Rs. 1145. They sent me links to download two files. The first file is a 450 MB zipped file which has a single PDF of all issues from 1924 to 2010 (14,500 pages!). The second file is a 45 MB file having separate PDF files for volumes 42, 43, and 44. The very helpful staff of Kaivalya Dhama sent the links within minutes of receiving my online payment. I only wish they had bookmarked the archive file for easier look-up.
