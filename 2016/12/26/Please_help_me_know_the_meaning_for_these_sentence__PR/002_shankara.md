Namaste,

  

Giving below a different translation from Devi Mahatmya edited by Alexandro Passi.

  

"If, however, you would give us a boon, O great Lady, may you, whenever called to mind, destroy our worst troubles. And whatever mortal praises you with these praises, O immaculate-faced one, may you, Arnbika giver of all, graceful in our regards, act through possessions, prosperity and power for the increase of his endowments of wealth, wife, and so on."



regards  
shankara
