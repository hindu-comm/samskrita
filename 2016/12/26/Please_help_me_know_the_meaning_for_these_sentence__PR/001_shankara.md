Namaste,

  

These are verses 35 to 37 from chapter 4 of Devi Mahatmya (Durga Saptasati). Giving below English translation extracted from Swami Jagadisvarananda of Ramakrishna Math.  

  

35. And if a boon is to be granted to us by you, O Mahesvari, whenever we think of you again destroy our direct calamities.  
36-37. O Mother of spotless countenance, and whatever mortal shall praise you with these hymns, may you, who have become gracious towards us, be also for his increase in his wealth, wife, and other  
fortunes together with riches, prosperity and life, O Ambika!



regards  
shankara
