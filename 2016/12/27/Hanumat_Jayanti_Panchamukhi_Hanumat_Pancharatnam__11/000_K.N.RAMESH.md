Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. At the outset, apologies for the long hiatus in my postings due to preoccupation with professional work.

  

As **Hanumat Jayanti** falls on 29-Dec-2016 (Thursday), I am glad to share a short and sweet prayer on **Lord Hanuman** on his five-faced form (**Panchamukhi Hanuman**) by **Sri. Venkatacharya Panditha**. As per South Indian tradition, Lord Hanuman's Jayanti is celebrated during the **Dhanur Masa/Moola Nakshatra** day.

  

**May I also extend my best wishes for a very happy and prosperous New Year 2017**, though not a Samvatsara by Hindu traditions! **May Lord Hanuman bestow you and your family/friends with health, wealth, opportunities, accomplishment, reward, bhakti and fulfillment in the new year!**

  

With best regards and Pranams,
