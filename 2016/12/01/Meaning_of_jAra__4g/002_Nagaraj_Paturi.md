These are mystic(ist) expressions.

  

जार literally means a person engaged in extramarital relationships.जारःis masculine. जाराis feminine.

  

Since Sri Krishna is depicted as having relationships with the married gopis, he is described as जारः.

  

But since the narratives in Puranas are undisputedly accepted as meant for vēdārtha upabr̥mhaṇa, narrative versions of the theoretical content ofśr̥ti, particularly Bhagavata is well established to be vēdārtha upabr̥mhaṇaof the vēdānta /upaniṣad part of theśr̥ti, ̐hat is described as'extramarital relationship' has to be understood in terms of the vēdānta /upaniṣad meaning of this motif/narrative element.

  

One way of looking at itis as follows: Attraction of jīvātmans towards iha lōka is viewed as 'marriage' of the gōpīs to their husbands. The'right' connection ofjīvātmansto the paramātman is viewed as the 'relationship' of the gōpīswith Sri Krishna. The mystic(ist) fun in this is, (as is with all mystic expressions), what is 'right' in the inward meaning is shown as 'wrong' in the outward meaningand vice-versa.
