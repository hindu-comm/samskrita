The problems with literal interpretations are as follows:

  

1\. The 17th 18th century literature, which in Telugu has been given, among other names, the name 'age of decadence', on account of the prominence of 'immoral' 'indecent' and 'explicit' themes, reflects an environment of justifying multiple relationships, some of them extramarital and some of them with sex workers etc .of the kings, in the name of 'emulating' Krishna or the justifying sycophants using the analogy of Krishna to justify the behaviour/lifestyle of the kings etc.

  

2\. Some of the 'Hindu' religious/spiritualpopular figures resorting to rampant sexual misbehaviour and excesses too use the 'emulation' / analogy of Krishna for their 'Hinduism'-defilingbehaviour.

  

3\. Detractors of 'Hinduism' too use the literal meanings to malign 'Hinduism'.

  

4\. Younger generation is denied the opportunity of grasping the minute subtle nuances of 'Hindu' Sanskrit culture, literature etc.
