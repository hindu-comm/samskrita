Dear Nagaraj ji,

Jay Jinendra

  

I quite agree with you. Verse should never just be read in the abhidha. We ignore the vyanjna and the lakshana arthas at our own peril. There are beautiful padas by Mirabai and Surdas which read differently when seen from the non-literal perspective.  
  
I would be happy to share some of my translations of those padas on this list but since it is a Sanskrit list, it would be improper to do so.

  

Manish.
