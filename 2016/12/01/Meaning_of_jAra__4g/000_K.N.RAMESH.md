In bhajan I heard the bhagavatas saying thus-

जार चोर शिखामणे - जय विजयी भव \|  

What is the meaning of जार here?  

Why is this ill repute epithet for Krishna?

Any story behind this apart from his known habit of stealing butter & stealing our mind with his mohana roopa?

What is the meaning of जार here?

  

namaskarams
