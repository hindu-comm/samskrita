Dear list

  

Another request for a commentary. In his *Hymn to Kālī: Karpūrādi-Stotra*, Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) refers to an 1891 Calcutta publication of the *stotra* with a commentary by Durgārāma-Siddhāntavāgīśa Bhattācārya. The publication had a translation by in Bengali by Gurunātha Vidyānidhi.

  

Is this book available online? I searched DLI and archive with several spellings but could not find it.

  

Is any other publication of the said commentary available?
