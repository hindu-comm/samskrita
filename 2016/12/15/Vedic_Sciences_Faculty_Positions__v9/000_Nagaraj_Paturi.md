**Enriching Modern Education with Vedic Thought**

** Inviting Applications for Faculty Positions**

MIT ADT University, Pune’s School of Vedic Sciences is uniquely positioned to explore proximity to its substantial student pool pursuing contemporary higher and professional education through **Graduate, Post graduate and Research Programs.**



The MIT School of Vedic Sciences (SVS) offers unique programs and curriculum that equip students of mainstream education with working knowledge of India’s native scientific tradition including Darshanas to enable inter-disciplinary innovation. Vedic knowledge offers deep insight into the inner springs of human behavior, the nature of knowledge, its instruments, methods, obstacles and remedies. By drawing upon and applying them innovatively, we aim to also nurture in our students the Assimilation, Communication and Empathy (ACE) skills required for success in any chosen career. SVS has a technology lab to facilitate research into Indian knowledge systems and their contemporary applications. The primary medium of instruction at SVS will be a mix of English and Samskrit. Samskrit communication will be taught to all upon entry.
