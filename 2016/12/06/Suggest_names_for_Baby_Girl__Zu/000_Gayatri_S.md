Hi,  
  
Namaskarams. I am due with my 2nd daughter in January and is looking for names that go well with my 1st daughter's name.  
  
My first one's name is Vishrutha and we are preferrably looking for unique sanskrit 3 syllable names that begin with 'V' and end with 'A'  
  
I am ok with names starting with any other Letter too..  
  
I would appreciate if someone suggests a few.. Thanks  
  
Also, what does Vivrdha mean in sanskrit?
