Lakshmi,



 namaḥ śrī-sarva-buddha-bodhisattvebhyaḥ\| नमः श्रीसर्वबुद्धबोधिसत्त्वेभ्यः।



 Something is getting lost in the transmission, not to mention in the translation.



You seem to be following a series of translations, Chinese to Malayan to English...



... and hopingto obtain a Devanāgarī version of that third-hand translation, but not surprisingly, can’t find one!

  



Whether you are seeking the prosperity that the maṅgala mantra supposedly brings, or simply the Devanāgarī text of that mantra, you would be wanting the original, authentic version... if indeed there is such a thing.



Perhaps, you should be seeking a Sanskrit speaking bi-lingual Chinese-English Buddhist person to pose your request (:-).



Good hunting,



 Taff Rivers
