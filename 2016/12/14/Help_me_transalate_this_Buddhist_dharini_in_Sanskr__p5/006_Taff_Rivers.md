Lakshmi,

  

The season's greeting to you.

  

 There is a quote*Translated from Chinese originally written in Sanskrit* to be found in a text:

  

<http://www.buddhisttexts.org/free-sutras-amp-shastras.html>

  

But that bald assertion does not seem to be substantiated in the book itself.

  

However, the publishers *Buddhist Text Translation Society* appear to be tri-linguists.

Perhaps you could query them as to the mysterious Devanagari source text.

  

As ever, though, there are degrees' peacefulness', and at all levels it is never the ritual chanting that does the business, but the being mindful of the objective of all those noise making (or word scribling) undertakings, whatever the noise makers inherited language.

  

A matter of active expenditure of native will-power. It is certainly not a passive procedure.

  

I speak of one whose humming-sound (eventually) made the light work.

  

I understand that your *dharini,*the term as in your original post, to be the Devanagari *dhāraṇī*, there being no such word as dharini.

  

  

Taff Rivers,

  

 R & D person, Information Technology, Retd.
