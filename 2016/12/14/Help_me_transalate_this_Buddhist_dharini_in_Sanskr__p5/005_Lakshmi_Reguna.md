Hi Taff,

The shurangama mantra was not translated into Malay language. It was only from sanskrit to pinyin chinese. The translation by master Hsuan Hua is considered to be a legitimate translation. I originally studied the shurangama sutra and discovered the chanting in pinyin. I looked for the sanskrit translation and came across this version. I have been chanting this mantra daily for a few months now and have experienced deep peace of mind.
