I have a deep interest in reading and learning Mahayana Buddhist sutras and mantras. These sutras were originally in Samskritam. Today India has lost valuable knowledge about Buddhism but these sutras have been preserved in Samskritam in siddham script in countries as far as Japan. Through a local bay area zen monastery I realized how to this day this precious knowledge from India is deeply venerated and preserved. Key Sanskrit words and many mantras were retained as-is since there was no equivalent in the local language. One of the important Mahayana Sutras is Shurangama sutra. The shurungama mantra which is a part of this sutra is very powerful. I chant it everyday and it has brought me immense peace of mind. I need your help to understand the meaning of Shurangama mantra and have it written down in Devanagiri script. I do understand some of the words in the mantra but not all of them. Can you please help me. This is the link to Shurangama mantra.
