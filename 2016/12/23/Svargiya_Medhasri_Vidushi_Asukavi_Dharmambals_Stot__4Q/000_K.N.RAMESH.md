Pujyasri Kumbakonam Swamigal has taken pains to dig out rare Stotras and Kirtanas of Svargiya Medhasri Vidushi Asukavi Dharmambal in Sanskrit on Devi Kamakshi, Adi Sankara and Sri Mahaswamigal and to get them published in the form of a book. Smt.Dharmambal never had formal education or training; yet by the grace of Sri Mahaswamigal she became an Advaita Vedantist, scholar and poet.

  

Please go through the attached book.
