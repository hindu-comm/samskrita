1\. Vishvamitra was born Kshatriya. Turned into a Kshatriya Rishi (Rajarshi ) first. Then could change (evolve through Tapas) into a Brahmin Rishi.

  

2\. Satykama Jaabaali's birth (from whichVarna father he was born) was not clear. But was accepted into Brahmin studenthood based on has steadfast truthseeking and truth-adherence.

  

3\. In Mahabharata, Paushya tells Uttanka that a Brahmin can withdraw a curse (spell) given /shot by him whereas a Kshatriya cannot. In the end of the story, Arjunaa Kshatriya withdraws his spell of Brahmas'ironaamakaastra, Aswatthaama, a Brahmin cannot. This shows Arjuna born as Kshatriya acquires Brahminhood and the Aswatthaama born as Brahmin acquires Kshatriya nature.
