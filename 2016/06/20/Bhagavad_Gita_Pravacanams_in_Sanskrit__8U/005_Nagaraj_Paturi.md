How is this video connected to Bhagavadgita pravachanams in Sanskrit?

  

Why do you make such sweeping statements on Pundits?

  

It is the pundits who have kept spoken Sanskrit alive through their conversations among themselves.

  

KN Rameshji's place Sringeri is witness to a daily activity of that.

  

Sri Sri Barati Tirtha Swamigal themselves gives lucid discouses in Sanskrit including on the Gita.

  

I do not know why this question was raised at all.
