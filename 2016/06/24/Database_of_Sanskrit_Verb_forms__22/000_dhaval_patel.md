Respected scholars,  

  

As a result of our work on tiGanta generation tool for past some years,  

We present the following database of generated verb forms of Sanskrit language for Sanskrit NLP community.  
  
[www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/generatedforms/verbforms.tar.gz](http://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/generatedforms/verbforms.tar.gz)  
  

The file is in XML format and a typical line is in the following format -  
  
\<f form="Bavati">\<root name="BU" num="01.0001"/>\<law/>\<tip/>\</f>  
  

Data set has a total of 267797 entries.  

Data has verb forms for around 2240 verbs.
