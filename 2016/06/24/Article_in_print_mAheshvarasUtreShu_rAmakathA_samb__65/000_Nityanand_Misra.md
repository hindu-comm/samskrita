Dear list members

  

A slightly edited version of the Rāmāyaṇa-centric interpretation of the Māheśvarasūtra-s (Śivasūtra-s) in Sanskrit grammar from the ‘Prastāvanā’ (introduction) of the “Adhyātmarāmāyāṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ” has been published as a four-page article with the title “Māheśvarasūtreṣu Rāmakathā” in the upcoming (July 2016) edition of “Sambhāṣaṇasandeśaḥ” (published by Samskrita Bharati), the largest circulating Sanskrit magazine in the world. The PDF of the proof is attached with this email. Many thanks to the editorial board of the magazine for publishing the article.Special thanks to Vidvān Janardana Hegde for sharing the proof.

  

The work “Adhyātmarāmāyāṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ” was authored byĀcārya Giridharalāla Miśra ‘Prajñācakṣu’, now known as Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya, in 1981. It was last published in its third edition which was edited with more than 1,000 footnotes by me in 2015. The third edition can be read and downloaded under[https://www.academia.edu/25018408/Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe_Apāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ_Vimarśaḥ](https://www.academia.edu/25018408/Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe_Apāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ_Vimarśaḥ).



Please forward this to those who may be interested.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
