There is really nothing concrete left to tell us why Kumarasambhava terminates suddenly after 8 cantos. The remaining cantos could have been irretrievably lost, the poet could have been stuck with sudden ill-health, or he could have died - anything is possible. What is traditionally heard is that Kalidasa was taken by remorse - or that his colleagues etc expressed their displeasure at his depicting so openly erotic scenes between Shankara and Parvati, something as abhorrent as describing love scenes between parents.
