My guess is thatपुण्ड्रेक्षु is a type of sugarcane, known in the rural areas of Maharashtra in sugar cooperatives as पुंड्या ऊस. Its juice is particularly sweet and it is used in road-side stalls that sell ready-extracted sugarcane juice by the glass. The cane is sweet and, at the same time, somewhat hard in its skin and eating it by using one's own teeth is both hard but rewarding.
