\> In the book I have, I see they have left a question mark as above. Pundrekshu is Sugarcane bow, that is usually attributed to Kamakshi or Manmatha. I am not clear how this is referenced here, may be Shri Dikshita is quoting puranic episode.

I am too confused to see the above remark "Pundrekshu is Sugarcane bow" so boldly that I left attempting reply. I also thought the same way as Arvind Kolhatkar as there is no word to denote bow known to me.

रसाल इक्षुस्तद्भेदाः पुण्ड्र-कान्तारकादयः।२.४.१६३।. अमरः

According to the above citation, पुण्ड्र is a variety of इक्षु only. Hearing from Arvind also I am sure.

Kama is associated with flower as bow as per Amara

पुष्पधन्वा रतिपतिर्मकरध्वज अात्मभूः।१.१.२७।

Its association Devi as in the following पुण्ड्रेक्षु doesn't mean Sugarcane bow:

पुण्ड्रेक्षुपाशाङ्कुशपुष्पबाणहस्ते*नमस्ते जगदेकमातः*॥ ३, ५.१ ॥

I was wondering how made such a bold statement!

Thanks to Arvind for pointing the fact.
