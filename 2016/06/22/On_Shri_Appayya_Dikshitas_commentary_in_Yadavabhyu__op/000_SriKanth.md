Namo Nama:

  

In the first shloka of Yadavabhyudam, there is a passage in Shri Appayya Dikshita's commentary, which is not clear for me.

  

The Shloka:

वन्दे वृन्दावनचरं वल्लवीजनवल्लभम् \|

जयन्तीसंभवं धाम वैजयन्तीविभूषणं \|\|

  

In his commentary, Shri Dikshita writes:

  

वैजयन्तीविभूषणमित्यनेन कृष्णस्य परब्रह्मस्वरूपत्वाभिव्यक्त्या काव्यस्य परब्रह्मगोचरतया पुण्ड्रेक्षुभक्षण (?) वेतनतुल्यं मुक्तिरूपं सूच्यते \|  

  

In the book I have, I see they have left a question mark as above. Pundrekshu is Sugarcane bow, that is usually attributed to Kamakshi or Manmatha. I am not clear how this is referenced here, may be Shri Dikshita is quoting puranic episode.

  

Please help clarify this.

  

Dhanyavaada:

Srikanth.
