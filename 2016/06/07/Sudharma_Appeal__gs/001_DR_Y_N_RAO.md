Dear Mr. SriKanth,  
  

Yes; 'SUDHARMA' needs everyone's support!  
  

What is the amount of present Yearly Subscription of 'Sudharma' (Sanskrit Daily Newspaper)? Will it be sent everyday to the Subscriber by Post?  
  

As regards the 'Donation' mentioned in the Attachment, is there any minimum donation expected?  
  

Please clarfy these points at the earliest.  
  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
