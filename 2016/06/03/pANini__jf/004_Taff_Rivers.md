Valerio,

  

 For a do it yourself approach, for English readers, you cannot do better that to buy this book:

  

 There is a downloadable version that you can checkout before committing yourself to buying it.

  

 It reveals the standardised formular employed by the commentators or old.

  

It's easy - when you know how.
