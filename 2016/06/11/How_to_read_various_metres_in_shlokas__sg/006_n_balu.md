Respected Sri Kolhatkar,

I have read that Gayatri has laghu and Guru syllables in the ratio of 22/7 (or 16 to 10). Is this true ? Are there other examples of meters of meters with this ratio. Please also give a well known sloka as example as you have done for the 31 meters. Maybe one or more of them follow the rule of 22/7 .

  

  

  

Thanks,

Balu
