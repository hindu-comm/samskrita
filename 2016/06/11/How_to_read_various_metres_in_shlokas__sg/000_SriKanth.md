sarvEbhyo nama:

  

While reading Sanskrit shlokas is there any best way to read the various metres? Some shlokas read in certain fashion (for example, Bhagavat Gita reading style employed by Samskrita Bharati etc) suit better and sound better.

  

Some shlokas in metres such as Anushtub, Pushpitagra, Totaka automatically reveal the reading style, others such as shikarini etc are if not read in certain style becomes difficult.

  

dhanyavAda:

srikanth.
