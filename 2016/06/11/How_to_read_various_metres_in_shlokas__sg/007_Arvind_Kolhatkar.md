Dear Dr Balasubramanian,

  

I do not think I have any competence to answer your question as my acquaintance with Vedic meters is very superficial. I may however say that I have so far not come across any such connection between the Gayatri Chanda and 22/7, the approximate value of the mathematical constant 'pi'.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
