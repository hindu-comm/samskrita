Dear All:

  

I have now included IPA in my Transliterator.

  

It will transliterate from Devanagari and Other Encodings of Choice to IPA and vice versa.

  

There was some ambiguity in the Correct Representation of IPA so I have consulted 3 Sites. But stil unsure which is the Standard.

  

The JAR is downloadable from below.
