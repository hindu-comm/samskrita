Namaste,

I have a question regarding verb usage and hope there are sanskrit experts who can answer it for me. I was looking at samskrita sambhashanam video and the teacher says 'bhavan vadatu' to indicate 'you say/speak'. This happens at [2:30 in this video](https://youtu.be/LnAJj2IovQA?t=2m30s)

  

Isn't vadatu a third person singular? Shouldn't this be second person singular**vada**instead of vadatu as in [BG 3.2](http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/3/2)'tad ekam **vada** niscitya' 'tell me one thing decisively'?

  

Thank you

Srinivasa
