Thank you all, the esteemed members, for your valuable answers and elaborations. I came across another usage in Srimad Bhagavatam that relates to the same topic and on which I need some help understanding it.

The verse in SB 9.10.4 says "**kosalendro ’vatān naḥ**" = "May the king of Ayodhya Protect us"

Here **naḥ** is used as an object (dvitiya bahuvacana) of **asmad**. Am I right in thinking the verb **avatāt** is **prathama 1.1 of av\[a\] pālane**? If yes how is the usage "kosalendro ’vatān naḥ" understood? Shouldn't uttama purusa be used here?

  

Regards

Srinivasa
