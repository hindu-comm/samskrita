Are the words भगवान् and भगवती also treated as the respectful forms for you (त्वम्).

In the statement भगवति हरिवल्लभे मनोज्ञे त्रिभुवन्भूतिकरी प्रसीद मह्यम्. It appears भगवती is the respectful form and normally प्रसीदतु would be appropriate, but because of the subsequent 3 names addressed directly to the Goddess, overall the subject is second person and प्रसीद is used.

The sentence भवति बिक्षान् देहि was earlier discussed in this forum and one explanation for the second person verb was 'त्वम् is to be treated as implied' and it is भवति त्वं बिक्षान् देहि.

With reverence to all
