Good question. As naḥ is अस्मद् द्वितीया used as उपपद to अवतात् naḥ, why shouldn't uttama purusa be used here?

As far as I know, '*लः कर्मणि*च भावे चाकर्मकेभ्यः ३।४।६९' says that

लः=लकाराः सकर्मकेभ्यः धातुभ्यः कर्मणि कारके भवन्ति, चकारात् कर्त्तरि च, अकर्मकेभ्यः धातुभ्यः लकाराः भावे भवन्ति, चकारात् कर्त्तरि च। द्विः चकार-ग्रहणात् उभयत्र {} इति सम्बध्यते। verbs are used in कर्त्तरि for सकर्मक and अकर्मक both. Here it is कर्त्तरि प्रयोग, it takes subject in प्रथमा विभक्ति and नः is not with समानाधिकरण same case ending with the कर्ता of the verb. As such it is not समानाधिकरण उपपद अस्मच्छब्द as required by the rule. Hence it will not take प्रथमपुरुष.

Scholars may answer this question.
