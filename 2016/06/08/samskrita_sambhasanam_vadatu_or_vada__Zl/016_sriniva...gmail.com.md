Respected HN Bhat and others,

I am sorry, looking at this sentence again it seems I didn't pay proper attention to it and confused others as well. 

KosalendraH is prathama ekavacana and the associated kriya is avatAt prathama-purusa ekavacana. naH is karma in dvitiya. In that sense there shouldn't be any ambiguity. Is this comprehension correct?
