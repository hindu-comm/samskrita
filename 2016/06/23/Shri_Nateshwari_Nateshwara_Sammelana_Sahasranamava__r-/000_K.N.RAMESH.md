Dear Devotees,



Sometime back I had circulated the Tamil version of Shri Nateshwari Nateshwara Sammelana Sahasranamavali. Please see the revised and updated version, where the errors have been corrected.



Those desirous of reading the Devanagari version may visit the website [www.sanskritdocuments.org](http://www.sanskritdocuments.org) and click Shiva under the heading Deity.



 I am happy to share a link on yet another beautiful ashtottara shatanamavali on Lord Shiva who is called shri airAvateshwara in Sri Nemam, near Tiruvarur.

\[Thisashottaram cannot be accessed without this link because the indexing is pending. Hence,please use the aforesaid link\].



I have translated theintroductory portion of the book to make us generally understand thegreatness of this temple.



You would also find that Shri Radhakrishna Sastrigal's books have been fully uploaded in [www.svradhakrishnasastri.in](http://www.svradhakrishnasastri.in). The hunt for his books can now be stopped. It would be a treasure to fully download these booksand keep it with you.
