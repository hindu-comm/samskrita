DearSir/Madam;

  
Thank you kindly for this wonderful gift. I think, this will beeventually sung, at least in some Indian households. I tried this in my class (in a shishu-vihara, run by a temple). Kids started mimicking and humming it:) Of ourse they were gigling and having good-natured "fun" trying to sing it in "happy-birthday" tunes:))

  

It was really nice to see them do it.The age-group is 4-8 years and the students were both Indians and non-Indians. That means, the song will not fade away and will be retained in some form or other! Thank you again.

  

By the way, I would appreciate if anyone can offer some reference (on-line or off-line) to Sanskrit lallabies.
