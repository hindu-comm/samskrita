I think this does not have English translation and may not be useful.

As read from the subject line, he doesn't know Sanskrit and hence looking for English translation:

"search book sri tattva cintamani by purnananda translated in english becouse i am italian and i don' t understand sanskrt or trasliteration"

And not transliteration or Sanskrit.
