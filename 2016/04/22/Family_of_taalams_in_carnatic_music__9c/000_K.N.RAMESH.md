In carnatic music, there are 7 basic types of rhythm, similar to S,R,G,M,P,D,N.

Also there are 5 jaatis or family.

They are Tisram, chatusram, khandam, misram, sankeernam having 3,4,5,7,9 units in them respectively.  

  

Names tisram & chatusram very well represent the units in them by their names itself while the remaining three does not. How to correlate them?

How to write them in devanagari - खण्डम् ,मिश्रं ,सङ्कीर्णं - Is this correct?  

  

My own explanation for this is,

  

Misram & sankeernam means mixing, ie., misram will be had by adding chatusram & tisram,(4+3) similarly sankeernam by adding khandam & catusram ( 5+4) - That means are they expressing a hidden meaning?  

  

Going on the same lines, khandam here in this context means divide, - that means to get 5, 4/2+3--> 2+3 =5 that way..

  

Am I right?
