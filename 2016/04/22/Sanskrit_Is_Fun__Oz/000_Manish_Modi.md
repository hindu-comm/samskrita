Here is a really fine set of 7 books for those who wish to learn Sanskrit. These books have been designed for use in the St James Schools in London but are perfectly suited for use in Indian schools as well.

  

As lovers of Sanskrit it is extremely satisfying to see so many new books available for those who wish to learn Sanskrit. Especially for the youth, it is essential that textbooks are well presented and reader-friendly.

  

These beautifully printed books are the ideal gift for anyone who would like to promote the study of Sanskrit, especially amongst the youth. These books are perfectly designed for Westerners and Indian students who have no exposure to Indian scripts and languages.

  

The books are well-graded and supported by appropriate illustrations that make them very attractive to the young. Today, many Indian schools as well as schools situated outside India offer Sanskrit studies. For such students, these books are the perfect means of making friends with Sanskrit. These books could be useful for those involved in the performing arts: theatre, dance and music, esp. singing. They would be ideal for students of Yoga and Ayurveda.

  

The first group of three books titled ‘Sanskrit Is Fun’ introduces learners to the Devanagari script. Letters are grouped according to their place of articulation called ‘family’ comprising both vowels and consonants. Learners are first taught how to draw the letters. Learning is assisted by the fact that the letters are presented in the form of animal figures. The next step is to add vowel to the consonant. And then to teach joint consonants. Finally, words and sentences are formed. 

  

The second group of four books seeks to teach Sanskrit with reference to the age old stories of Krishna and Rama. These stories which command an interest of their own are pressed into service to teach vocabulary, the formation of nouns and the conjugation of verbs in all three tenses. Adjectives and prepositions are also covered.

  

By the time learners have completed this course, they will have a good basic grasp of the Sanskrit language, its vocabulary, structure and grammar. These books are an attempt to teach Sanskrit in a simple and systematic manner that may well dispel the notion that Sanskrit is a difficult language.

  

This set of 7 books is superb for youngsters who wish to learn Sanskrit. We are happy and proud to promote this set along with the other Sanskrit learning materials that we sell.
