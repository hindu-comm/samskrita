Look the word azvatthAmA, in the Puranic Encyclopedia and you will get all the details.

Here it is from PE:  

    
7)*Aśvatthāmā* *and his jewel.*The anger of Aśyatthāmā didnot abate even after killing Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the butcher \[Page069-a+ 65\]of his father. With a view to destroying the whole Pāṇḍava dynasty he sent against the Pāṇḍavas the all-power-ful Brahmaśirāstra (a missile charged with great power  
by a holy incantation). But Droṇa had given the sametype of missile to Arjuna also and so he sent forth his tomeet the other. It created such a great explosion thatall the elders on both the sides joined together and requested them to withdraw the missiles. Arjuna demandedthe jewel on Aśvatthāmā's head to withdraw his missile.  
But Aśvatthāmā refused to part with it. He said, “Thisjewel of mine is more valuable than all the wealth of bothPāṇḍavas and Kauravas put together. If you wear thisyou need not be afraid of your enemies, disease, hungerand thirst. No harm will come to you from Yakṣas,Nāgas or thieves. I will never part with such a jewel”.(Ślokas 28-30, M.B., Chapter 15, Sautika Parva).

Aftergreat persuasion Aśvatthāmā surrendered his jewel butwithout withdrawing the missile directed it towards thewomb of Uttarā who was bearing a child then. Weare reminded of an incident which happened whenthe Pāṇḍavas were residing in Upaplāvya; a poorbrahmin looking at Uttarā said, “When the Kauravaswill be weakening in power a child will be born to you.The boy will have to bear a test even while in thewomb and so you must name the child Parīkṣit (Onewho has been tested)”.  
When the powerful missile was flying straight towardsUttarā's womb Śrī Kṛṣṇa said, “Even though the childin the womb will die of this arrow it will be reborn.Oh, Aśvatthāmā, you will be denounced by all as asinner for killing this unborn babe. To suffer for thisevil deed you will roam about in the earth for threethousand years. Nobody will associate with you; you willbe shunned by society. You will be tormented by alldiseases on earth. But the babe which you have nowkilled will be a famous scholar and brave King. He willrule this country for sixty years. He will be know as the next Kururāja. Look, I am giving life to the babeyou have killed”. Vyāsa supported Kṛṣṇa, and Aśvatthāmā repenting on his hasty action gave the jewel tothe Pāṇḍavas and left for the forest with Vyāsa.
