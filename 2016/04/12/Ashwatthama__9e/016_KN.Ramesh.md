Thanks a lot Dr.Bhat ji, Taff ji & Arvind Ji for the help.

  

I was only looking for the reference of the slokas from Mahabharat and not from MW.

  

In PE, I did not opt for output to be in Kyoto-havard while in input I left it as Kyoto-harvard & hence the link did not work.

  

Now it is working.

  

Thanks a lot once again Dr.Bhat ji.
