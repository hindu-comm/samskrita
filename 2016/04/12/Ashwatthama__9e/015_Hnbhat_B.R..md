He has given the source in the first posting itself. It is there as he mentioned::

" **Krishna's rage**

Krishna cursed Ashwatthama with terrible leprosy that would haunt him for 3,000 years. Krishna further stated that Ashwatthama would not be helped by anyone or provided food or shelter."

<http://www.speakingtree.in/slideshow/is-ashwatthama-still-alive-the-facts-will-make-you-believe-he-probably-is/krishnas-rage>

He asked whether the information he got from the link are true and in my first post the link for reliable source for looking for correct information. Since he couldn't look up there the word अश्वत्थामन् as suggested by me, he asked the second question and to which I myself looked up the word in the nominative and pasted in reply to his second question relevant portion from the Puranic Encyclopedia.  
This information from PE prooved to be true by quoting relevant text to the curse in the Mahabharata with exact verse numbers to refer. And the question in the first post is answered as the information from the Speaking Tree is not reliable.

And nothing in replies is irrelevant to the questions.

Now only give his confirmation of unreliability of his source of his information.
