Arvind,

  

 What is being sought is *information* that enables*pratyakṣa*of the *source* of these 'beliefs'.

  

 In which *actual texts*do we read about '*Ashvatthama's curse of the festering head-wound',* please?

  

 Thus thatallIndians, not to mentionnon-Indians*,*may see for themselves and f*rom pratyakṣa*of their own eyes may alsobelieve so.

  

 As it happens I am familiar with 'microbiology', having worked in a pathology lab.of a general hospital.



 '*Some*' cure for Hansen's disease, as it was known, was discovered way back in 1941.

  

  

 Bacteria are visible, so too are texts, the evidence, the source text, please, that we all may thus believe.
