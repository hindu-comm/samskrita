Dear Taff,

The curse to be affected with leprosy for killing pandava's sons is
occurring in Mahabharata?

The references in MW gives the occurrences of the word श्वित्र and not the occurrence of the curse mentioned in Mahabharata as required by Ramesh.

***PañcavBr****.*and***Suśr. BhP***  

They refer to पञ्चविंशब्राह्मण, सुश्रुतसंहिता - the first being Vedic text and the second being medical text, the chances of Krishna's curse is nil and in a medical text the word will be used श्वित्र. The third is भागवतपुराण without specific reference as to Skanda, Chapter and verse number, it is difficult whether श्वित्र occurs as part of the curse of Krishna as mentioned by Ramesh and even if be part of the curse, it does not occur as part of the curse in Mahabharata according to the source text cited. Only his mention of the duration of the curse 3000 year and wandering as orphan seems to be corresponding to the nature of curse in Mahabharata cited.

I will check the episode in भागवतपुराण for the occurrence of the word any how.
