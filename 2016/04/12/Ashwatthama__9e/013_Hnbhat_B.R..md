None of the two occurrences of श्वित्र in भागवतपुराण is related to the curse.

The meaning of the word श्वित्र or its sources was not asked for by Ramesh. The source of the curse in Mahabharata was asked for and the source text doesn't contain leprosy or श्वित्र as mentioned by him in the text quoted.
