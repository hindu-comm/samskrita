"श्वित्र - having white leprosy"

  

This mix-up between 'leprosy' and 'white leprosy' (vitiligo) is a creation of the widely-held misunderstanding in the Indian languages about these two distinct medical conditions. They both are called 'कुष्ठ' ('कोड' in Marathi ) and both lead to social ostracism and boycott of the affected person. They were both considered incurable, though 'leprosy' is an infectious disease passed on through contact/proximity and 'vitiligo' a medical disorder that is not passed on through contact. With advancement in the science of Microbiology, some cure is now possible for leprosy but 'white leprosy' remains without cure.

  

As to Ashvatthama's curse of the festering head-wound, the belief prevalent in some parts of India is that he still wanders around in the night and comes to peoples' houses in the midnight, asking for butter to apply to his painful wound.
