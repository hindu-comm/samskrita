  Moreover "*Where is this occurring in Mahabharata?*" is entirely unrelated to the*puranic reference.*

*  Members need to know the specifics of which particular*Mahabharata*text you **don't** quote from.*

*  The source word is*śvitra *'***white****leprosy' but it is not 'leprosy'.

 śvitra or***Vitiligo,***which does turn people white , is something else.

     Myths and legends get *embroideredwith the telling*, the more fanciful the better.

  

     It is vital to quote from the source text(s) themselves, while specifying the version.

  

 ***Leprosy!***
