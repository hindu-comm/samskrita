Dr,

  

 *"I was only trying to guess as to why MW has referred to 'white leprosy' in his explanation of 'श्वित्र'."*

*  
*

  MW's lexicographers invariably justify their assertions by citing their sources, as indeed they do in this instance.

  viz. ***PañcavBr**.* and***Suśr. BhP***

  

  However, it does appear that the ***origin(s)*** of these things are long lost in the mists of time,

  And with existing translations, we are dependent on the interpretations of the translator.

   And with existing translations, we are dependent on the interpretations of the translator, and the philosophical schools that he subscribes to.

  

  Taff,

  

   BTW. Amicrobiologist is a technician that works in a laboratory, with microscopes. He/she is not a physician.
