I gave the story and the source as mentioned in the Puranic Encyclopedia of Vettam Mani, searchable online.

I was only trying to guess as to why MW has referred to 'white leprosy' in his explanation of 'श्वित्र'.

The next verses contain the nature of the curse as given in the story given in PE:

निर्जनानसहायस्त्वं देशान् प्रविचरिष्यसि  
भवित्री न हि ते क्षुद्र जनमध्येषु संस्थितिः१०,०१६.०११  
पूयशोणितगन्धी च दुर्गकान्तारसंश्रयः  
विचरिष्यसि पापात्मन् सर्वव्याधिसमन्वितः१०,०१६.०१२

There is no mention of Leprosy श्वित्र or otherwise, but conclues as सर्वव्याधिसमन्वितः१०,०१६.०१२d.

We have to take the word of the physician and microbiologist diagnosed as श्वित्र as he also has not cited the source to support his statement that it was श्वित्र.

May be some other source may contain श्वित्र.

Index of Names in Mahabharata also gives the same nature of curse without mention of leprosy white otherwise:

**16**(Kṛshṇa, with the assent of Vyāsa, decrees that the unborn  
son of Uttarā-Parikshit shall be born dead, but be called tolife by Kṛshṇa, while*A.,*for having killed an embryo, shallwander about for 3000 years in the wilderness, stinking andoppressed by all sorts of diseases;
