None of these are similar. There is no rule prescribing feminine suffix for सकारान्त words either in compound or not. They are declined like masculine.

Here the question was about नकाान्त words having the form अन् isolated and in बहुुव्रीहि compound and वन्, मन् forms ad exception to  
ङीप् generally prescribed for नकारान्त and ऋकारान्त words.
