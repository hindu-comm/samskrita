नामन्,यशस्,मनस्

,



by themselves are neuter. When they happen to be the end word of a बहुव्रीहि, they morph like in रामनामा, प्रथितयशाः, उद्विग्नमनाः when qualifying a masculine.As per Dr.Bhat उद्विग्नमनाः and प्रथितयशाः will remain unchanged when qualifying a feminine word.and उद्विग्नमनसं सीताम्, प्रथितयशाः सीता are right. Have I understood correctly?
