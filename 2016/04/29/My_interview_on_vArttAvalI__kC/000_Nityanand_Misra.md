Dear list members

  

Please forward to those who may be interested.

  

This week’s edition of the Vārtāvalī weekly Sanskrit news magazine will feature my interview. In the interview, which is in Sanskrit with Hindi subtitles, I speak on scientific and mathematical aspects of Sanskrit language and grammar (mentioned Wiebke Peterson’s work on Śivasūtra-s and the algebraic aspects of Sanskrit derivational rules), balancing a day job in an investment bank with my passion for Sanskrit, my work in the field of Sanskrit, digital publishing in Sanskrit, and thoughts on use of social media for promoting Sanskrit.
