Hello all,

  

While studying Sanskrit I started learning to chant the Bhagavad Gita but ran into some problems.

  

Different versions have the devanagari font displayed in different ways.

  

Is this due to modern printing with Unicode that renders it like this which looks so different from traditional printing?

  

Please find 2 samples attached

  

Looking forward in hearing your replies.

Vivek

  

PS: look especially at the first "dr" from the word "drstvaa"
