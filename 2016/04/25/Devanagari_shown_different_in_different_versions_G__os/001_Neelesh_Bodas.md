Devanagari is not a font. It is a script.

  

Just like latin script can be written using different fonts in different ways -A A A A A

Unicode is only a character set, and different fonts can represent the same character in different ways. That includes theसंयुक्ताक्षर (compound letters) also.

  

Hope this helps!
