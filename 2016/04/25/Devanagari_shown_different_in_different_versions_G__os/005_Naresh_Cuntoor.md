Ken,  

Could you provide a basis/reliable source for this comment?  
  

As far as I know, Devanagari is just a script like any other. Samskrit is written and read in many scripts besides Devanagari.  
  

Traditionally, a notion of daiva bhaava is ascribed to Samskrit (e.g., as Dandi says, "samskritaM naama daivii vaak ..."). Could you provide a similar claim for Devanagari (or some other script)?
