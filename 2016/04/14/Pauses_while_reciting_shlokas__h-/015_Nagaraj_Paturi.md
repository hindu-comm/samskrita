Yati is also called viraama, virati etc. It is a spot location where the recitation of the verse is paused. In Sanskrit and many Indian languages, Yati is maintained in the form of word ending.

  

\>I believe Yati as given in Chandasshastra is not very strictly followed by even the best of poets.

  

This means that even the best of the poets do not strictly break the word at the Yatisthaana. That is, they may not give a scope for pausing at Yatisthaana.

  

Can you give examples?

  

\>Verses in Kannada composed as per Sanskrit vruttasdo not follow Yati at all.

  

-can you give examples?
