Thank you, Prof. Nagaraj Sir.  
A short pause after पपात, (with an equal short reduction in the pause after the पूतनैका), does not seem to affect the meter much, and honours the sentence too.  
  
=======  
Out of curiosity, I followed the link in the earlier post by विश्वास (" वृत्तरत्नाकरादिग्रन्थेषु ([ये ऽत्र](https://sites.google.com/site/padyadhaaraa/) लभ्यन्ते) ") and got to a Google Document that describes this "Pause" as यति:  

<https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bxc_Vgxp0P2RVVRHUEp1bDRvTWM/edit>  
 Page 43  
  
I then searched to see if such adjustments in pauses are actually documented anywhere, and looked for यति, and got a few links.  
  
In one of the documents -- I couldn't decipher the meaning of "क्वचित्तु पदमध्येऽपि समुद्रादौ यतिर्भवेत्‌ " despite the examples given there. Maybe it refers to the same topic?

Another document is hard to read, because the letters are not very legible. (Beginning Page 3 last line on the left side)
