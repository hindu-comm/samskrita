The original question by Sri Pradyumna Achar was to resolve a problem.

  

He expressed his awareness of general style of pause as per meter. But his question was based on the point that the pause at the end of the line वियोजिताङ्गी किल पूतनैकाbreaks the sentence.

  

I think the solution is as follows:

  

There are two kinds of pauses: metrical line end pauses : This is of two types:aarohaNaatmaka (raising)pause, which has a tone of expectancy of the next line and the avarohaNaatmaka (falling) pause, which has a 'concluding-like' tone.

  

In this case, at the end of मुकुन्दविद्वेषविषानुषङ्गात् there has to be aarohaNaatmaka (raising)pause, which has a tone of expectancy of the next line

  

and at the end of वियोजिताङ्गी किल पूतनैकाthere is usually
avarohaNaatmaka (falling) pause, which has a 'concluding-like' tone.

  

But in this case (and in all such cases), because the sentence is continuing the falling pause should not have concluding tone, the length of the pause should be reduced a little, so that the word is quickly picked up.

  

In the lines,पपात धन्या ललनाग्रगण्या and जगाम चान्यामरलोकलोकम्the line पपात धन्या ललनाग्रगण्याshould haveaarohaNaatmaka (raising)pause, which has a tone of expectancy of the next line, but with minute sentence ending pause at the end ofपपात.

  

At the end of the verse, avarohaNaatmaka (falling) pause, which has a 'concluding' tone just fits.
