Method of recitation is inherent to the छन्दस्.  

When a श्लोक is quoted in two lines, each line is called as चरणः.

But eachश्लोक also has four quarters पादाः Meter orछन्दस् is better analysed and understood by studying aश्लोक by itsपाद-s and not byचरण-s.

Givenश्लोक has fourपाद-s, each with 11 letters. Prosodic analysis requires that fourपाद-s of anyश्लोक be first identified.

1.  मुकुन्दविद्वेषविषानुषङ्गाद् - Note, Mr. Ken P has ended thisपाद
    atमुकुन्दविद्वेषविषानुषङ्गा. According to me, this is not correct.
    The 11 letters मुकुन्दविद्वेषविषानुषङ्गाद् have मात्रा-s
    1-2-1-2-2-1-1-2-1-2-2. By making sets of 3 letters,
    (1-2-1)-(2-2-1)-(1-2-1)-2-2 So the गण-s are ज-त-ज-ग-ग. 2.  वियोजिताङ्गी किल पूतनैका - in thisपाद, the first word, according to
    Mr. Ken P is put as द्वियोजिताङ्गी which is not meaningful. When
    identifying theपाद-s, one should be alert that eachपाद, especially
    at its ending and beginning becomes
    meaningful.The11lettersवियोजिताङ्गी किल पूतनैकाalsohave
    sameमात्रा-s 1-2-1-2-2-1-1-2-1-2-2. By making sets of 3 letters,
    (1-2-1)-(2-2-1)-(1-2-1)-2-2 So the गण-s are ज-त-ज-ग-ग. 3.  पपात धन्या ललनाग्रगण्या -The11lettersपपात धन्या
    ललनाग्रगण्याalsohave sameमात्रा-s 1-2-1-2-2-1-1-2-1-2-2. By
    making sets of 3 letters, (1-2-1)-(2-2-1)-(1-2-1)-2-2 So the गण-s
    are ज-त-ज-ग-ग. 4.  जगाम चान्यामरलोकलोकम् - Thisपाद should be read as containing only
    two words and not asचान्या मरलोक लोकम्. Note here also मरलोक as a
    separate word is meaningless.The11lettersजगाम
    चान्यामरलोकलोकम्alsohave sameमात्रा-s 1-2-1-2-2-1-1-2-1-2-2. By
    making sets of 3 letters, (1-2-1)-(2-2-1)-(1-2-1)-2-2 So the गण-s
    are ज-त-ज-ग-ग. 5.  Since all fourपाद-s have sameगण-s - ज-त-ज-ग-ग, this is
    उपेन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम् or उपेन्द्रवज्राछन्दस् Apte's dictionary also
    notes that the 11 letters in each line be recited in two parts 5,6.
    This sets the rhythm for recitation. Splitting given by Mr. Ken P
    for the fourth line asजगाम चान्या मरलोक लोकम् is alright, since the
    code 5,6 recommends a pause at 5. But it ought to be noted that, it
    is only a short pause, not a split. So one may rather put it asजगाम
    चान्याऽमरलोकलोकम् 6.  I thought it good to analyseमात्रा-s andगण-s of all fourपाद-s
    also for a reason. Amongवृत्त-s with 11 letters in eachपाद, there
    is also इन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम् which has very much identical rhythm as
    ofउपेन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम्. In fact one does come across श्लोक-s, which
    may have twoपाद-s inइन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम् and twoपाद-s
    inउपेन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम्. The meter of suchश्लोक-s is then called as
    उपजातिवृत्तम्. One needs to hence always check whether the
    givenश्लोक is inइन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम् or inउपेन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम् or
    in उपजातिवृत्तम्. This checking needs checking all fourपाद-s. By
    the way, inइन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम् the गण-sareत-त-ज-ग-ग. It also has
    pause-notation as 5,6.
