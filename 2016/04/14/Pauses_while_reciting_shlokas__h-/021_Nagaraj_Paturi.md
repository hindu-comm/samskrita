First one " सद्यः

सीरोत्कषणसुरभि क्षेत्रमारुह्य मालम् "is a good example of a pause creating a problem.

Second one is not, because pause separates नूनं यास्यति fromअमरमिथुनप्रेक्षणीयामवस्थाम् which is not a problem at all.

In the first one, सीरोत् + कषण that comes because of a pause after four syllables is a wrong Sandhi split.

It is in such places that the adjustment in pause suggested by me comes handy.

Please note that such cases are very rare and adjustments are possible.
