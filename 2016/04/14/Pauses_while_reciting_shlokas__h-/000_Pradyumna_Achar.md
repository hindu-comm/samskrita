सादरं वन्दनानि\|  
In reciting a shloka, is there a rule as to where the pause should be?  
  
I get confused in examples like this one below:  
मुकुन्दविद्वेषविषानुषङ्गाद्वियोजिताङ्गी किल पूतनैका \|  
पपात धन्या ललनाग्रगण्या जगाम चान्यामरलोकलोकम् \|\|
(श्रीमद्वादिराजतीर्थकृतरुग्मिणीशविजये)  
  
If we follow the "meter", it would have to be at the end of पूतनैका, where it would sound pleasing when recited.  
But going by the meaning, "मुकुन्दविद्वेषविषानुषङ्गाद्वियोजिताङ्गी किल पूतनैका पपात" would sound like one unit. However, it would sound bad if we give a pause after पपात, and then recite the rest of the second part.  
Saying the whole shloka in one breath without a pause would make it sound more like prose.  
  
What is the correct place for pause in such cases, and why?
