Arvind,

  

 ***Irony*** asto convey a meaning that is the opposite of its literal meaning?

    the irony of her reply, “How nice!” when I said I had to work all weekend.

  

  As Webster's has it:  

  

    The essential feature of IRONY is the indirect presentation of a contradiction between an action or expression and the context in which it occurs.

In the figure of speech, emphasis is placed on the opposition between the literal and intended meaning of a statement;

one thing is said and its opposite implied, as in the comment,

“Beautiful weather, isn't it?” made when it is raining or nasty.

Ironic literature exploits, in addition to the rhetorical figure, such devices as character development, situation, and plot to stress the paradoxical nature of reality          or the contrast between an ideal and actual condition, set of circumstances, etc., frequently in such a way as to stress the absurdity present in the contradiction   
      between substance and form.

  

        IRONY differs from SARCASM in greater subtlety and wit.

  

  

     I found these in my customised**MW**, thought they don't seem to distinguish between the two senses.

However, your choices, suggest you are after a different sense than '***irony***'?
