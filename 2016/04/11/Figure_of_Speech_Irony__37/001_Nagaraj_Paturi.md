Among verbal, dramatic and situational ironies, it is verbal irony that you seem to be asking.

  

Verbal irony is the contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning.

  

There are many concepts in Sanskrit Alamkaara S'aastra that involve this feature:

  

vyaajastuti

  

etc. are figures of speech which has this feature.

  

vipareeta lakshaNaa is the lakshaNaabhEda which has this feature.

  

But vyaajastuti and irony are not translations of each other.
