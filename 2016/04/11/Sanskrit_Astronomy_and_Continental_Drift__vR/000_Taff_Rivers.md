All,

  

 The current news has prompted me to wonder if there is any mention of the gravitational effects of the ***Sun and Moon together***, on the Earth's tides.

I understand that the Sun has only half the pull of the Moon, given its distance, but even so, that is a substantial influence.

  

 I am not really expecting to find that the ancients had the concept of *Continental Drift* in connection with the formation of the Himalayas.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff
