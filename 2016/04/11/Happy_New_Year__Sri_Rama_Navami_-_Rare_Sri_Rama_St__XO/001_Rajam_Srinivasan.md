Sir;

  

Thank you for your good wishes. May you and yours also be blessed with contentment, peace and prosperity in this year "Durmukhi" and all the years to come.

  

We were informed (by our temple priest) that this "durmukhi" is the name of this year which is a part of the 60-year cycle based on lunar calendar. Are there similar "cycles" based on other calendars such as solar-calendar? Is there a source (on or off-line) which gives a list of the names of all the years of this "cycle" and all other cycles (if such classification is prvalent)? Are there names of these cycles also? Are these cycles part/s of bigger cycles?

  

Any info in this regard will be greatly appreciated by teachers/students/devotees of our temple.

  

Thank you kindly.

  

With regards.
