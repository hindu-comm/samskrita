How very interesting!

  

I have a niece (by marriage) who has been named 'Heli'. But she was named after the comet.

  

Meaningless names and misspelt names have long been my pet peeves. I cannot understand Hindus/Jains/Buddhists/Sikhs formally naming their children 'Prince', 'Sweety', 'Honey', 'Pinky', 'Shiny', etc. etc. Also names like 'Vivaan' which basically alludes to the art of basket weaving!

  

Of course, we are a secular democracy and everyone has the legal and moral right to name his or her children as per their choice. But really, names based on Sanskrit or other Indian languages sound so much nicer! Besides, parents should think of the child! He shall have to carry his given name for the rest of his life!

  

All this reminds me of a very sweet novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, called 'The Namesake'.
