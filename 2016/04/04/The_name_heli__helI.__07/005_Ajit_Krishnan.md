Most shastra works have samgya prakaranas. It is entirely possible that the word was defined there, or was used in a context where the meaning of the word was obvious.

  

For example, take the word "leyaH" that I mentioned previously. I remember it from the samgya prakaranam in some jyotisha work (IIRC the jAtaka pArijAta).

  

shAstra granthas exist to teach a shastra, and not to appease the sentiments of people who won't be born for another 500+ years. If a stalwart uses it without defining it (and that is a big IF), perhaps it was a common word of the times.
