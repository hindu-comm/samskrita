namaste,

What's the problem?  

  

His purpose is to teach a shastra, and he is certainly welcome to use terminology that is common in field. In fact, one would expect that he \*should\* teach terminology that is common, so that the student can understand other sources ... whether those terms have a perfect derivation or not. There are many instances of words that don't derive back perfectly. Another example in jyotisha is "leyaH" which is said to derive from "Leo". 

  

Samskritam is not a perfect language, and probably never was. It's best to admire it for what it is ... what purpose is served by foisting our own imperfect expectations on Varahamihira and others?

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
