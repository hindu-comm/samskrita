Hi Taff,

  

I am no scholar of Sanskrit and unqualified to discuss its semantics with you or anyone else. But India has been around for a long, long time. She has been called Aryavarta, Bharat Varsh, Hindustan (Persian), Al Hind (Arabic) and several other names. But she has been there. It is an ancient land.

  

So please do not say that there was no India in Varahamihira's times.

  

Manish
