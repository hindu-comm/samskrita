I feel there is a serious problem if you use a 'foreign' word for the first time in a text without saying anything about it, or defining it. How can you expect other's to understand it properly? Terminology is generally taken from other languages without change if such a thing or concept does not exist in your language. Sun being so common and having hundreds of paryaayaas in Sanskrit does not fit for this case. ज्या being a new and complex mathematical concept traveled from Bharat towards west but changing its form in Arabic and finally in Latin (Sine).  
  
Why it should not bee seen from that angle which says that there are hundreds (or thousands) of words which are common in Sanskrit and many other languages?
