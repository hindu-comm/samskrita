I recently came to know that someone has named his new-born son as हेलि/हेली and that it is a Sanskrit name. I was askepticalabout the Sanskrit-origin-part of this name.



I knew of the Greek name Heliodorus (Gift of the Sun) from the '[Heliodorus Pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliodorus_pillar)' near Vidisha. Upon checking with the MW Dictionary it turned out that the word 'हेलि', meaning 'the Sun', has actually been used by वराहमिहिर in बृहत्संहिता. वराहमिहिर must have been aware of this word through his knowledge of the astronomy of the Greeks.
