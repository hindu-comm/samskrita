Namastey Mahoday Bhat and Mahoday Rivers,

  

No, the attempt was just to see how much would that quantity of silver cost at today's price - assuming of course, that it reflected the denominated value (for example, a one rupee coin or one rupee note may cost more in making that the value it carries). Yes, I understand the complexities of Macroeconomics, but at the first go it really seemed exciting. My first trouble was to understand what the Karsha could be made of etc. Now that that is done, the rest is about improvising the estimate and fine-tuning, and I felt so good that I thought I will share it with you all! Thank you!
