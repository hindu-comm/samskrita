Exactly!

I have searched google, also dictionaries, but when the information is "this OR that OR something else..." then it becomes impossible to visualize or establish relationships.

Especially, as I have also quoted verses from Shukraniti, there is the whole hierarchy of kings, established based on their earnings. I want to estimate it and compare it with the average income of CEOs (equalizing for inflation).

  

So, thanks to all the others, but general suggestions won't work for me unfortunately :(

  

Pranam to Bhat Mahodaya.
