Arvind,

  

 The request is for *information*.

 Forum members have already provided useful resources,that give *solid evidence viz.*silver & copper coinage.

  Such is useful as an aid to dating the age periods of ancient literature. Manuscripts are only as reliable as the memories of the script writer.

  Time, may be eternal, but documents are not.  

  Sliver and copper coin last a bit longer and are carbon dateable.

  

  Then again, there are the stone and terracotta rebuses of the famous Indus regions, current studies are recent, work is ongoing.

  

  Maybe in the dry sands beneath lost temples of old...
