I think it would be difficult to answer Margie's specific question as to the presence ofकर्ष in the 11th to the 14th century B.C. Is any verifiable documentary evidence available for anything that goes so far back?

  

In my limited understanding the Vedas do not refer toकर्ष in the sense of 'a coin' anywhere. The wordकर्ष appears once in Rigveda 5.83.7 but there it means 'pulling down'.

  

The earliest that we can go back is the period of the Mauryas.
