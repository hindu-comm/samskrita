Thanks, sir!

  

Well, I wonger if there may be some records, especially in Shukraniti there is a great emphasis on recording - so many things, actually. He insists in different places that one record one's investments and loans, the king keep records of his finances and other affairs, and even that his officials should not accept any order even from the king if it is not in writing!

  

So, I thought that if there were any writings (elsewhere) on Karshas, then I could draw interesting analogy between the top-earning CEOs of today vs the kings of various stature of the yester years - in the times when Shukraniti was written.

  

Best wishes,

margie
