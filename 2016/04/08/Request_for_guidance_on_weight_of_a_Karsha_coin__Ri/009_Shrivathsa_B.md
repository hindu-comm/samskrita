hariH OM,  
  
I got the following definition (slightly than that given by shrii aravind) here:  

पञ्चगुञ्जाप्रमाणं तु माष इत्यभिधीयते ।

माषैः षोडशभिः कर्षः पलं कर्षचतुष्टयं ॥ इति कर्षलक्षणम् ॥  
  

This is in a book called राममहादर्शनम् published by Svarnavalli matha, Karnataka, page 25. There is no reference given for this.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
