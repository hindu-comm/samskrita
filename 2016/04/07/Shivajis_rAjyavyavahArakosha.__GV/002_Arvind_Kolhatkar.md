I could not readily locate where I had taken these texts from. However, I have now uploaded [शिवचरित्रप्रदीप](https://archive.org/details/ShivacharitraPradipBhaISamMam)and [श्रीशिवराज्याभिषेकप्रयोग](https://archive.org/details/ShriShivrajyabhishekPrayogGagabhatta)to [archive.org](http://archive.org) and you will find them there.

  

शिवचरित्रप्रदीप is in Marathi, though you will find the completeराज्यव्यवहारकोश in it in Sanskrit from p. 137 onwards.
श्रीशिवराज्याभिषेकप्रयोग has been edited by the historian the late V.S.Bendre in English. It contains the full Sanskrit text of theराज्याभिषेक ritual designed by Gagabhatta.
