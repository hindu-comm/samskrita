hariH OM,  
aravinda varya,

 It was fascinating to read the koSha. It will be of interest to all those who are interested in meanings of surnames. I have been interested in the history of surnames since some time.

 Thanks a lot for this. Is this the only koSha of this sort? Are there other koShas which list the Urdu / Farsi and Sanskrit equivalents? I am particularly interested in surnames.

Also, is there literature available as to which castes in the society took up the respective jobs? Or is it that they slowly became castes in themselves?

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
