Shivaji was ritually crowned asछत्रपति in his capital at Fort Raigad on June 8, 1674. Gagabhatta, a pandit of Varanasi known throughout India for his learning, prepared the ritual from ancient texts and revived the ancient ritual ofराज्याभिषेक that had fallen into disuse for centuries.

  

The Marathi language prevalent till the 13 century can be seen in texts of that period such asज्ञानेश्वरी - a commentary by ज्ञानेश्वर on गीता or in लीळाचरित्र, a biography of चक्रधर, the founder of the महानुभाव school. This language had words taken from Sanskrit - तत्सम, words derived from Sanskrit - तद्भव, or purely local words not having any Sanskrit ancestry - देश्य. The last class descends from whatever local language existed in the region before the advent of Sanskrit.

  

After the shift of political power into the hands of Muslim rulers from the middle of the 13th century, when the Yadav Rule in Devgiri was overthrown by the Khiljis, the language of the rulers started exerting influence over Marathi. This went on to such an extent that documents purportedly written in Marathi in the 17th century are scarcely recognizable as such.

  

When Shivaji challenged the Muslim Rule and had himself ritually crowned, he asked one of his ministers, Ramchandra Amatya, to compose a
collection of words to replace Farsi words with Sanskrit alternatives.
Ramchandra Amatya did so with the assistance of Dhundhiraj, another learned Brahmin and brought tbefore Shivaji a book called
राज्यव्यवहारकोश, containing 1380 Farsi words in administrative use and their Sanskrit equivalents. In it, Ramchandra Amatya writes as follows:

  

कृते म्लेच्छोच्छेदे भुवि निरवशेषं रविकुला-  
वतंसेनात्यर्थं यवनवचनैर्लुप्तसरणीम्।  
नृपव्याहारार्थं स तु विबुधभाषां वितनितुम्।  
नियुक्तोऽभूद्विद्वान्नृपवर शिवच्छत्रपतिना ॥८१॥  
सोऽयं शिवच्छत्रपतेरनुज्ञां मूर्धाभिषिक्तस्य निधाय मूर्ध्नि।  
अमात्यवर्यो रघुनाथनामा करोति राज्यव्यवहारकोशम् ॥८२॥
