Continuing this topic further, what are the antecedents of the title of छत्रपति that was assumed by Shivaji - and subsequently by his successors - after his coronation? I am not aware of the use of this word in any piece of classical literature. Was this term specially coined for him. If so, would Gagabhatta who wrote down the procedure for the ceremony be its originator?
