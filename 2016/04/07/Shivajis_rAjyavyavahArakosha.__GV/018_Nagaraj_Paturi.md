The point is , the word Chatra being used in a metaphorical sense for royal power or a king's or emperor's rule is older.

  

Shankaraji too provided example from Matsyapurana with such a meaning.

  

Apte's #2 can not be without any basis. Particularly his use of the word jamboodveepa in this definition indicates an ancient source.

  

The very approach of Sri Gagabhatta of drawing material from ancient sources which forms the basis for his work, shows that the word chatrapati could also have been drawn from older sources.
