Kolhatkarji,

  

I am not sure whether this information would be useful to you. The word एकच्छत्र is used in a similar sense in Matsya Purana 272.19.  

  

ततः प्रभृति राजानो भविष्याः शूद्रयोनयः।  
एकराट् स महापद्मो एकच्छत्रो भविष्यति॥



regards  
shankara

Thanks Nagarajaji,

  

I did suspect that the word'छत्रपति' was not in prior common use and that Gagabhatta appears to have coined it specifically for'श्रीशिवराज्याभिषेकप्रयोग'. I wanted to be sure of this fact before I committed this in writing elsewhere.
