Dear Nagaraj-ji,

  

The point of my asking was whether the wordछत्रपति, in the sense of a ruler, or a king had any precedent in the classical or older literature.
If not, I wanted to say that credit for the usage of the word post-Shivaji's coronation is due to Gagabhatta, a significant observation, which, to my knowledge has never been made.

  

Your citations of Monier-Williams and Apte do support what I think.
MW's definition makesछत्रपति an employee, tasked with the care of theछत्र. He obviously is not the ruler who sits under theछत्र. V.S. Apte, in his first meaning does equateछत्रपति with a ruler but does not cite any authority. I think that being from Pune he was certainly aware that छत्रपति was Shivaji's title and he converted this knowledge into his meaning No 1. He did not have any previous authority before him where he saw this word in the sense of a ruler. His No 2 appears to be too obscure to be the source of the use..

  

That is why I saythat the word'छत्रपति' was not in prior common use and that Gagabhatta appears to have coined it specifically for'श्रीशिवराज्याभिषेकप्रयोग'.
