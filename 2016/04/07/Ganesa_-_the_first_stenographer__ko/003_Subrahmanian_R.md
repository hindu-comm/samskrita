Of course sage Veda Vyasa composed sort of deceptively, to make the reader split the way you have done. He intended गंगाज (Bhishma) लंकेशवनारि (Hanuman the enemy of Ravana's vanam or udyanam) केतु: flag.  
It is addressed to Bhishma, and describes Arjuna, who was having Hanuman in his flag.  
नग first time is a tree and second time mountain. नगाह्वयो नाम popularly known by the name of a tree - Arjuna; नगारिसूनु: son of enemy of mountains (Indra, who chopped off the wings of mountains)

  

I do not remember the second line
