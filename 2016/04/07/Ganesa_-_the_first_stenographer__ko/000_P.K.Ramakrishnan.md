Vyasa is the composer of Mahabharatha which is the longest poem in the world.

  

He wanted to select a stenographer. He invited Brahma. Brahma advised him to

seek the help of Ganesa.

  

Vyasa invoked Ganesa. Ganesa appeared in front of Vyasa. Vyasa told Ganesa

that he wanted a writer for the Mahabharatha. Ganesa agreed on condition that

he would not stop taking down the stories after starting. Vyasa put a condition that Ganesa

should not take down anything without understanding the meaning.

  

When the dictation was going on Vyasa found that Ganesa was too smart and could

understand the meaning of any sloka. Then Vyasa started dictating some slokas which

took time to know the meaning.  These slokas are called granthi (knotty) in Sanskrit.

  

There are several ganthis in Mahabharatha. I remember one -

  

patathaam pathatham ghoshah pathathaam pathathaam iva.
