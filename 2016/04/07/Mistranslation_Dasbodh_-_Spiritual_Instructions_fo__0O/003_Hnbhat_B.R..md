Sharma , Varma , Lal , and Das I believe the order was in earlier days of Brahmanas , Kshatriyas , Vaishyas , and Shudras . Shudras were not slaves . They provided services . All the varnas were providing services of different kind and were interdependent .

Just like the word 'dasa' is interpreted diferently out of context, the English word 'servant' taken outside the context would mean differently, male servant or maid servant only, but not the servant of God as the context needs. It may be servant of Rama or Krishna!

I don't think Ramadas himself called as swamy, which his followers used to call him and he himself being a humble servant of Rama. Or himself do not claim himself as master himself. It is not the way dasa-s behave, claiming themselves.

The servant of God would be correction that was needed to understand the compound दास-बोध if translated out of context would mean 'service code of conduct to the servants' which at all suitable in the context. दास्य is one of nine kinds of Bhakti

श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम्।  
अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम् ॥  
इति पुंसार्पिता विष्णौ भक्तिश्चेन् नवलक्षणा  
क्रियेत भगवत्यद्धा तन् मन्येऽधीतमुत्तमम्।।  
— श्रीमद्भागवतम् ७-५-२३

and दास is one who is devoted to His service and not any maid or male servant intended in the compound. दास-बोध means in the context "the instruction of (conduct) to the दास - the servant (of God)" and not the instruction of conduct any slave towards his master/mistress.
