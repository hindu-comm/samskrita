This is hilarious.

  

Ramdas Swami, whose given name was Narayan Thosar, took the name of 'Ramdas' to express the though that he was a Das of Rama or slave-like devotee of Rama. Your translator has rendered the name of his book, Dasbodh, as 'Instruction for Servants'. Dasbodh is actually the teachings of Ramdas to his followers.and not'Instruction for Servants.

  

Such machine-like word-for-word translation, without reference to context behind the use of the word, results into funny situations. The other day in this Group the following query appeared:

  

My sentence to convert is "there, at the 13th nation..."

If i say, तत्र त्रयोदशे वर्षे, is it correct?

Does it mean 'there, at the 13th nation?"

  

The querist was obviously under the impression that वर्ष means 'Country/Nation' becauseभारतवर्ष means 'the country of Bharat'.
