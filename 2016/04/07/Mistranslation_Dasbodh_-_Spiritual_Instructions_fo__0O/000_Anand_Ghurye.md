Height of Mistranslation

  

This is english translation of Dasbodh by Swami Ramdas . Dasbodh has been translated as Spiritual Instruction for Servants ! Phew , never thought that this kind of faulty translation would ever be found .

  

The right translation would be Realisations of a Devotee . Swami Ramdas is noting down his realisations in spiritual path , and calls himself as humble servant of God .

  

Surprisingly the translators of the original book are Indians.
