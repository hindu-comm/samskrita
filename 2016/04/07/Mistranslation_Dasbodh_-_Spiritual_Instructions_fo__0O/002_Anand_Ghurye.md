Dear Kolhatkarji ,

  

Thanks for your reply .

  

I believe the word Das does not translate as slave . Das is a very mild term . Sharma , Varma , Lal , and Das I believe the order was in earlier days of Brahmanas , Kshatriyas , Vaishyas , and Shudras . Shudras were not slaves . They provided services . All the varnas were providing services of different kind and were interdependent .

  

So in this parlance of Ramdas Swami , he called himself as Swami ( Master of self ) and Das of Ram . It would be a true devotee .

  

  

  
  
  
Regards ,  
  
Anand Ghúryé
