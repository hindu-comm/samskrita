The point is to translate elephant from English to Sanskrit, too many synonyms create confusion. For example, करेणु and करिणी are used exclusively for she elephant, and गजी is not so popularly used. Translator is baffled with feminine and masculine gender giving the same meaning "elephant". सुप्रतीक is the name of one of the दिग्गज-s, as per Amara,

सुप्रतीक¦पु० सुष्ठु प्रतीकं यस्य । ईशानकीणस्थिते दिग्गजे

and not used for any elephant in Sanskrit. For translator it will be confusing.
