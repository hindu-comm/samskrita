Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Vasanta/Chaitra Navaratri** is starting on **08-Apr-2016**, I am happy to share a rare short and sweet prayer on **Goddess Bhagavati** from **Vamana Puranam** and **Chapter 56** which condenses the entire **Devi Mahatmyam** in a short chapter of 4 pages.

  

The Chaitra/Vasanta Navaratri is probably not as famous as the **Sharada Navaratri** that comes in Sep/Oct timeframe but **Srividya Upasakas** are expected to observe this without fail, as I learn. **Sri Rama Navami** falls within this Navaratri.

  

As we have seen before, hymns on Devi extol Devi as the Mula-Prakriti and even Trinity are the creations of this **Mula Prakriti**, This is mentioned in this prayer too **'hari-hara-rAjya-dAyinI'** (one who gives the respective kingdoms of Hari and Hara). But the name given to the Mula-Prakriti varies in different purans, though there is absolutely no confusion arising out of this as it is given without any doubt that it is the same Devi who bears different names in different contexts. This concept is exquisitely expounded by **Lord Narayana** in **Gayatri Stotram** in **Devi Bhagavatam** (**Adishakte jaganmAtar bhaktAnugraha-kAriNI**).

  

Though **Radha** is never is mentioned in **Srimad Bhagavatam**, Radha has been extolled as the Mula-Prakriti in many many Purans such as Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Padma Purana, Narada Pancharatra, Rudra Yamala, Adi Purana, etc. **Lord Parashurama** mentions that **Radha** is same as **Durga**.

  

May We Pray To Devi Bhagavathi during the ensuing Chaitra/Vasanta Navaratri festival.
