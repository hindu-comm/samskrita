Hi Taff,

  

Me too from IT. Here you go :

  

1\. BRD? -Business Requirements Document

  

2\. SDLC? - Software Development Life Cycle

  

3\. chasers of project management?

  

4\. development stories? - We usually divide a development sprint (Agile Mathod) in a smaller and workable stories.

  

5\. poc? - Proof of Concept

  

Hope this helps.

Thanks,

Alankar
