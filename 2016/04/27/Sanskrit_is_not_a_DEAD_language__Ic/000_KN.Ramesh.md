I have just uploaded a talk by HH. Paramapoojya anantasri vibhushita Sri Sri Bharati Teertha mahaswamigal, Dakshinamnaaya mutt, Sringeri on Sanskrit language in chaste Sanskrit.

  

Request scholars to give English translations, so that the same can be put as sub-titles so that those who do not know much Sanskrit can also understand.

  

The video is here:
