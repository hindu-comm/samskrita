Very true and helpful.

I have created a Sanskrit based NLP for Quick Software Development. It is quick because the software gets created while writing the BRD. This improves the experience of SDLC and impacts the turn-around-time by 99%\[Because most of time goes in chasers of project management, and only little time in writing development stories. This concept might be clearer for IT people\].

Since, I am Bangalore based, I wanted to work with interested companies/businesses/governments to do poc/pilot for them.

I am planning to do a launch function in Singapore on 23 July 2016.

Please advise www.i-c.tech

  

Best,

Prabhat
