done. update is here.

## 13/04/2016

1.Many fixes

2.Telugu transliteration is completely corrected. now it is errorless as much possible.

3.Very Importaant feature, now added page number and position of word in original book  
at end of each word,, neatly formatted. address is for example like  
'6th word in left half of page 679 in original book' . this will greatly  
easifies referring, and oother.

1.  Paadya layout improved.

5.Digit orders in head words like abhimanyu 1 etc,completely removed for iast head words.  
as when double clicking name in description, it is redirecting to list of those words, instead  
of giving description of all at one page. Now it is fixed by this,

6.Like previous, Digit orders removed for normal english head words too.  
as we searcch mostly with them, instead of giving all list it now gives  
single entry with out digits, and contain all details.same with telugu words too.

7.Due to these changes, when we click on that unified entry, we will get all  
those results in one page.but with same bold titles for all entries. it displays  
first headword of that entry as bold title. that's why we kept devanagari entry  
as first entry in heaadwords.. to display devanagari headword as bold title.  
and IAST headword is there in description. So first devanagari entry is mainly  
intended for display, along with search. So in devanagari headwords, digits are  
not removed. as there is no problem for double clicking, linking with these words.  
And an Unified digit less devanagari word also is appended,and it will be first  
result, when you searched in devnagari, as normal.

8.By these changes , now no problem when double clicked,  
no numbered lists when searched in english, but unified entry.  
when searched in devanagari, though numbered lists desplayed  
but unified entry only first option to click.  
And thus display is not cubersome.titles are well defferentiated.  
and can differentiate words in source file too.  
this screenshot will show, page number details, and numbered titles in unified entry.

9 And a lot of improvements.
