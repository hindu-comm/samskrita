All other words in the accusative are adjectives and qualifiers to श्रीबालकृष्णं - ---

शीतल हृदय विहारम् श्री रुक्मिणी दारम्

As it is typed it is confusingly as दारम् is detached from श्री and रुक्मिणी. It should be a बहुव्रीहि compound and in normal printing in Devanagari script words in a compound are not separated with space like श्रीबालकृष्णं.
