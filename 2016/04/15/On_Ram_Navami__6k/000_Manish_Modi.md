Greetings on Ram Navami!

  



Here is a Braj couplet that expresses the hold that Lord Rama has on the hearts of many.

  

राम तिहारौ रंग तो जनमत है सब ठौर

कहुँ दिखियत है लाल हरि, कबहू स्यामल गौर

\~ रूपर्ट स्नेल

  

raam tihaarau rang to janmat hai sab thaur

kahun dikhiyat hai laal hari, kabahuu syaamal gaur

\~ Rupert Snell

  

O Rama, because you are in everything,

You take on the hues of the world.

Sometimes you appear red or green,

Sometimes dark or fair.



  



Along with the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is one of the two great epics of India. There are various recensions

of the *Ramayana* 

which have been popular in India and South East Asia for hundreds of years. Many Ramayanas have been critically edited. Others have not.

  

  

We are proud to stock a large variety of *Ramayanas*, composed in various Indian languages, expertly translated either into Hindi or into English.
