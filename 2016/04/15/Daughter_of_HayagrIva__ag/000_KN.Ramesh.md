Dear all,

  

Is "durmukhi" the daughter of Lord Hayagreeva ?

  

Is there any reference to support this?  

  

Even in sankara TV and few other TV channels the astrologers quote this without any references.

  

durmukha means horse,serpent & has many other meanings. But does it mean she is the daughter of Hayagreeva...??

  

PE search for दुर्मुख & हयग्रीव did not speak about any daughter of hayagreeva.

  

  

thanks
