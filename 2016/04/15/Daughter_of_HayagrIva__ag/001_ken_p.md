*Here are few links that don't refer to the daughter of Lord Hayagreeva ?*

  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayagriva>

Mythologically Durmukhi is the sister of Vakrasura. When vakrasura was killed, the sister wanted to take revenge and gave lot of troubles. parvathi Devi decided to kill Durmukhi though the latter was pregnant. Devi removed the baby from the womb and wore the baby in her ears and killed Durmukhi.On knowing this we tend to feel that Parvathi was more demonic than Durmukhi herself.
