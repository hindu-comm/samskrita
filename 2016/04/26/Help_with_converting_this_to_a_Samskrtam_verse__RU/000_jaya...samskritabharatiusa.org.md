NamaskArah,

  

A friend of mine was given this verse in Tamil by her Guru. She wishes to have it converted to a Samskrtam verse. Any volunteers?

  

arut perum jothi

arut perum jothi

ennul meiyyAna meiyum neeye

AthmAvum neeyeh

en AthmamahAshakthiyum neeye

  

For those who do not know Tamil, I am sorry this doesn't help.

  

Thanks

Jayanthi
