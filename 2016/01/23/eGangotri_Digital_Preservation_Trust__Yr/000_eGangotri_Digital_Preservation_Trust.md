Dear All:

  

I am sure most of you know about the eGangotri Team.

  

We are into digitizing Rare Books and Manuscripts related to Sanskrit and Indology.

  

I sometimes need a platform to generate awareness about my Work. A Similar Google Group I was posting to , found them filtering most of my messages hence I am joining here.

  

We have currently two sites in [archive.org](http://archive.org):

  

<https://archive.org/details/@indologicalbooks>  

<https://archive.org/details/@dharmarthatrustjk>  

  

The First One is For pre-1957 Books and the second one is for Manuscripts.

  

I had had many accounts in scribd also before but have since moved to [archive.org](http://archive.org) and surprised how much more productive I am , especially because the metadata for bulk uploads I have sort of found a way toautomatizeit using Web-DriverSelenium and the Code is also viewable at

We are targeting Kashmir Shaivism and Agama Collections and anything in Sharada and hope to be in Kashmir for atleast the next 2-3 Years.

  

I hope to meet many nice people in this Group and last but not least - all our Data is for Free Distribution and Viewing and anything we have ever done is available online and will continue to do so in Future as well.
