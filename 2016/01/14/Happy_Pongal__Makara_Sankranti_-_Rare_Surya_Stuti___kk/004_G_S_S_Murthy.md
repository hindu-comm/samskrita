Thanks, Aravindji, for your very informative note. I have very little knowledge of Astronomy in general, and Hindu Astronomy in particular. My query was more like from that of a layman than a competent person. Given all the uncertainties associated with the various calendar systems, it could still be meaningful to fix an upper and a lower bound to when our ancients started reckoning Uttarayana. I believe this exercisewould be too evident for not having been attempted so far.

Regards,

Murthy
