Dear Sri. Iyengar,

I am inadequately equipped knowledge-wise to understand your note let alone respond adequately. My logic, perhaps simplistic, is as follows.Sometime during the hoarypast our astrologers/astronomers determined that Uttarayana occurs on 14th/15th of January. I assume that 21st December which is known to be the shortest day of the year is the same as Uttarayana. Over the years what was occurring on 14th/15th January now occurs on 21st December. This is due to the precession of the equinoxes, which has a period of around 23000 years. The slip of about 22 days corresponds to 365/22 degrees. If precession is 360 degrees for 23000 years, 365/22 corresponds to 23000x22/365 years 1386 years. That means about 1386 years back, shortest day occurred on 14th/15th January. I am aware this is a ball-park figure and may need several corrections associated with calendar systems.

I shall attempt to read your paper a leisure.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
