Murthyji,

  

You say "If Uttarayana has started on Dec21st, can we work back and determine when our panchanga system started taking one cycle of precession of the equinoxes as 23000 years? At that time in the past uttarayana would have come on or around 15th January."

  

The issue of the history of Panchanga is a very complex one. Some idea of its complexity can be gathered from standard books like the classic 'भारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास' by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit, published in 1896. This book is in Marathi, although an English translation by RV Vaidya, authorized by the Department ofMeteorology, Government of India, (under whom the observatories in India fall,) is available. Its digital version is also available on theinternet at several places, including at [scribd.com](http://scribd.com). A perusal of this book will give you some idea as to when did Hindu astronomers become aware of the precession of equinoxes -अयनचलन -and what was their measure of it.

  

The subject is further complicated by the lack of any all-India non-regional system of reckoning, itssynchronizationwith solar reckoning and also by the complex history of theChristian calendar and its progress from the Julian to the Gregorian. 

  

One small instance of this complication is present even today. Lokmanya Tilak, apart from being the leader of masses in the freedom struggle, was also a recognized scholar in Indian Jyotisha. He and his followers were trying to reform the Panchanga as it wastraditionally being drawn in Maharashtra. They called it the Shuddha Nirayana -निरयन -Pamchanga. (I do not understand why it was so called, except that it hadsomethingto do with the calculation of theprecession.) Tilak's Nirayana Panchanga never achieved any mass following. Only die-hard followers of Tilak, a minority, followed it. It was followed in my household. One oddity of that Panchanga was that its Makarasankranti fell on the 10th January each year, and not on the 14th as with thetraditionalPanchanga.
