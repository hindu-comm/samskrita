Introduction

  

For all grammarians of Indo-European languages, particularly those who study ancient and medieval languages, Prakrit represents an important development in Indo-Aryan. The Prakrits, a group of languages rather than a single homogeneous entity, are amongst the oldest languages known to mankind. The Prakrits were the spoken languages of the common man in ancient and medieval India.

  

A great deal of ancient and medieval literature, both ecclesiastical and secular, has been written in Prakrit. In fact, Prakrit was used in a wide spectrum of literature, from the austere texts of the Jain religion, to highly erotic poetry. India’s oldest surviving written materials, the Ashokan inscriptions, are composed in Prakrit, using the Brahmi script.

  

The Subject

  

This book highlights three works on Prakrit grammar composed by three distinguished grammarians - Markandeya, Purushottamadeva and Ramasarman - who lived between the 12th and 17th century of the Common Era. All three belonged to the Eastern school of Prakrit grammar and composed elaborate works on Prakrit grammar in Sanskrit.

  

All three grammarians borrow from a common pool of knowledge. They show enough links with each other and cite from a common store of poetry and plays to indicate that they were aware of each other.

  

The Book

  

This book starts with an introduction to the study of grammar in ancient and medieval India, and describes various Prakrits from the linguistic and usage-based points of view. Short monographs on the lives of the three Prakritists - Markandeya, Purushottamadeva and Ramasarman are also given.

  

The chapters based on each of the Prakrit languages under study:

Pracya

Avanti

Magadhi

Paishaci

are perfectly translated into English and critically analyzed. Comparison is made between the different Prakrits. The style and content of the three Prakrit grammars is studied in depth. Uniquely, the Prakrit text is printed in Devanagari, instead of the Western academic custom of publishing the original text in Roman. This makes the book more reader friendly.

  

This aesthetically produced book is ideally suited for Indologists, scholars and all those interested in Prakrit.

  

The author, Saartje Verbeke, is currently working on her doctoral research on the ergative construction of Indo-Aryan languages from syntactical and semantic viewpoints at Gent University, Belgium. While she works with Prakrit and Sanskrit, and studies their grammatical and literary developmental aspects, another area of interest for her is the study of Marvari, Assamese, Kashmiri and Nepali. This book was originally written as a Master’s thesis.

  

We are proud to publish this book as part of our ongoing Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series. We hope to publish many more works by this fine young scholar as part of our series.
