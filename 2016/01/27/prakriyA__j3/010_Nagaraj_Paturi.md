One of the ways polysemy occurs is through semantic change. Multiple meanings can not be beyond explanation. It is not wrong to take semantic change as the explanation until an alternative explanation is found.



Other explanation could be : a coincidence of two different homophonous words being taken as one word with different meanings.



In this case, that explanation doesn't seem to work.



Semantic change need not necessarily be diachronic.
