I said in one of my previous posts:

  

One may ask, 'how do you then connect affection and oil ?' I am not yet equipped to make this connection. Ido not even know if this is a case of two different words that are homophonous.  

  

Sharing snapshot from Monier Williams for snih-.

  

" to be adhesive or sticky or glutinous or viscid or moist " makes me feel that 'to be adhesive' and/or 'moist' have connections to affection.
