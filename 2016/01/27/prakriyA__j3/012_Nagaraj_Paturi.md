AadaraNIya Nityanandji,



1\. Let me start with



\>Also I would be interested to know why you hold the direction of the change to be "oiled" to "shiny" and not "shiny to oiled".



If I knew any meaning (such asshine, light, polishor lustre)for स्नेह other than affection and oil , I would have considered 'shiny to oiled' also as one of the possibilities.



2\. Now, diachronic vs synchronic: Let us take the discussion on vriittis. When we say a certain laakShaNikaartha comes through lakshaNaa vritti extending from the original abhidhEyaartha we are talking synchronically. Explanation for most of the idioms islakshaNA.lakshaNais an extension of meaning from abhidhEya to laakShaNika. One of the explanations for multiple meanings in a polysemy is lakshaNA.



3.One may ask, 'how do you then connect affection and oil ?' I am not yet equipped to make this connection. Ido not even know if this is a case of two different words that are homophonous.



Thanks,



Nagaraj
