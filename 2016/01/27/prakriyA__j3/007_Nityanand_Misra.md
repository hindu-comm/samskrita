Prof. Paturi Ji

  

Is there any evidence to show there was a semantic change in the meaning of the word from 'oiled' to 'shiny'?

  

The root ष्णिहँ प्रीतौ (धा॰पा॰ १२००) being intransitive, the formस्निग्ध्वा is also intransitive.

  

The form is Pāṇinian, and hence there is no uncertainly whatsoever on whether the from can be used or not. It is listed in standard Dhātu works including the *Mādhavīyā Dhātuvṛtti* and *Kṛdantarūpamālā*. Here is a reference:<http://sanskritlibrary.org/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvscan/disp/index.php?page=487>

  

Thanks, Nityanand
