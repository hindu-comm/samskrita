Does not the statement below indicate a change over time:

  

"but स्निग्धा through semantic change moved from 'oiled' to 'shiny'"  



The way I understood it was that the meaning was "oiled" which changed to "shiny" over time. If it meant something different, I am sorry to have misunderstood it.

  

Are there examples of semantic changes which are not diachronic? Even if we bring geography into semantic change, would not the change of meaning of a word in a different region happen at some point of time or over a time range? 

  

Also I would be interested to know why you hold the direction of the change to be "oiled" to "shiny" and not "shiny to oiled".

  

Thanks, Nityanand
