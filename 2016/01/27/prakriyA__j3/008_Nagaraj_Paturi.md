\>Is there any evidence to show there was a semantic change in the meaning of the word from 'oiled' to 'shiny'?



You have स्निग्धा = anointed and you have स्निग्धकपोल .I would not say anointedkapola. The only explanation for this meaning in स्निग्धकपोल is a change from anointed andnot from affectionate.
