Good News for Sanskrit Lovers!   
  
<http://www.navelgazing.net/2014/08/good-news-for-sanskrit-lovers.html>

  
As a lover of dharma, sanskriti and bhasha, I am always enthused on seeing new approaches and new books for learning/teaching Sanskrit. I am a very, very junior beginner level entrant in the world of Sanskrit who was lucky enough to learn under a guru. But for those of you who are less fortunate, here is a selection of books that you could use to learn Sanskrit on your own.
