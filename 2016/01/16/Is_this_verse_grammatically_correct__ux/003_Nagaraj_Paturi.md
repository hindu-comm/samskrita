Just to make Vidwan Arvind Kolhatkar's words more clear:



Those who told Vidwan Harry Spier that there was an error probably wanted to point out that the visarga at the end of लक्ष्म्याःis wrong; because due to sandhi it is already changed into स् .



Whether they noticed/pointed out or not, the second problem is in तनत. It is not तनत. It isतनुत. Here again originally it is तनुतः. Since it is followed by the vowel उ in उत्पन्न the visarga gets omitted.
