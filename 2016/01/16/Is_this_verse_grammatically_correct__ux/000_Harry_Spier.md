Dear list members,

  

An on-line version of the Bilv°∏«akam has verse 6 as

  

lakṣmyāḥ stanata utpannaṁ mahādevasya ca priyam bilva-vṛkṣaṁ prayacchāmi hyeka-bilvaṁ śivārpaṇam \|\|

  

I've been told that there is a grammatical error in this version. I've been told that in the phraselakṣmyāḥ stanata utpannaṁ " the word "lakṣmyāḥ " doesn't make sense. But I don't see the error. Can any of the knowledgeable Sanskritists on the list confirm whether the verse is grammatically correct or not and if not give me the details of whats wrong.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
