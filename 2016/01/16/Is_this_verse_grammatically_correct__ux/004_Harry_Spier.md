According to the grammars I have a final visarga before the letter s can either optionally change to " s" or remain visarga. I'm also aware of the version of the verse posted by Arvind. But I'm trying to determine if this version though different from that other version posted by Arvind is grammatically correct. I.e. is "lakṣmyāḥ stanata utpannaṁ "
grammatically correct and does it mean "arisen from the breast of Laksmi " ?

  

Thanks,
