I think the word has undergone some corruption in the process of transferring into vernacular languages.

  

Neither MW nor Apte show any word asनीराञ्जन. Instead they show
नीराजन as the light-holding receptacle used inपूजाविधि. I know it for a fact that in current Marathi the word employed isनिरांजन as in the old song [निरांजन पडले तबकात](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWdHnogmmIs) Yet, Molesworth's Marathi-English dictionary does not show that word. Instead, it hasनिरंजन. I would therefore presume thatनीराञ्जनं समर्पयामि is an error caused by old habit.
