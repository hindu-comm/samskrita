Gioni Silva:Within the grammar of Pãnini, who rises first: the verb or noun? Historians claim that Pãnini said: "The noun was born before the verb."

  

------ The historians you mention are wrong. Panini's Ashtadhyayi does not deal with the question of noun roots originated from the verb roots or vice versa. It is a descriptive grammar and does not deal with such issues. It is a rule based grammar. The rules generate grammatically correct forms. There are no explanatory passages where there is a scope to discuss such issues.

  

Yaska's Nirukta has a discussion on the issue ofnoun roots originated from the verb roots or vice versa. Yaska quotes opinions in favour of both sides of the argument.

  

Please compare the Greek books that discuss the issue ofnoun roots originated from the verb roots or vice versa with this and not all the general grammars of Greek that are not concerned with the issue ofnoun roots originated from the verb roots or vice versa.
