Dear Nagaraj Paturi, I am sorry that my thanks (for your answer) took so long!

  

Thank you very much for your teaching on the birth of the verb (from Pãnine) before the noun. But somebody said that Pãnine stated that the verb was invented first.

  

I love Pãnine even though I never met him!If I traveled in time I would love to be with him!  

  

All the best,

  

  

Gionei
