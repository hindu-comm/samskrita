Gionei,  
  

From the material perspective, a verb, being an action, derives from that what so acts, i.e from noun things.  
On the world's stage, without an actor, there is no action.  
And one would be entitled to a refund.  
  
From the immaterial perspective, that is Sanskrit, the language of the gods,  
the matertial arises out of the immaterial.  
The immaterial gods, act, and out of that activity arises matter.  
Here, the nature of the matter that so arises is in the lap of those gods,  
  
And so viewed from the Sanskrit perspective, in the beginning was the verb from which was born the noun.
