Please, who was born first: Pãnini's Grammar or Grammar Greek? In Yãnka’s Niruktayhe noun from at least the 5th century. In Anciente Greekwasónoma(noun), referred to by Plato in theCratylus dialog, and later listed as one of the eight parts of speech in The Art of Grammar, attributed to Dionysius Thrax(2nd century BC). Within the grammar of Pãnini, who rises first: the verb or noun? Historians claim that Pãnini said: "The noun was born before the verb."

I appreciate any help,

Gionei
