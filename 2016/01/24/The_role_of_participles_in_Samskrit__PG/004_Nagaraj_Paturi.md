Dear Mr Gopi Sudarson,



Is your interest in suffixes or participles? You titled your first post /the thread as 'the role of participles in Sanskrit.' But the discussion is running around suffixes.



क्त्वार्थक,शत्रर्थक,चेदर्थकetc. are what are similar to what are called as participles in English.



Suffixes and spoken English doesn't seem to make sense as a topic. But क्त्वार्थक,शत्रर्थक,चेदर्थकetc and spoken English makes sense.



Please make your question clear.
