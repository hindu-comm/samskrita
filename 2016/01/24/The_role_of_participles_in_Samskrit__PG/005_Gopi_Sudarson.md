Dear All,  
As adviced by Shri. Nagaraj, I am clarifying my query.  
My query is related to participles as in, present,past and future active and passive participles.  
I am specifically interested in learning how I can use them as a verb-form or as an adjective form. While used as an adjective-form what expressions or conjunctions can they be used to signify. I am yet to find an authoritative source that deals with various usage and give practical usage examples . Please pardon my ignorance and enlighten me.
