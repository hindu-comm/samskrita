I was wrong in saying :



क्त्वार्थक,शत्रर्थक,चेदर्थकetc. are what are similar to what are called as participles in English.



क्त्वार्थक,शत्रर्थक,चेदर्थकare non-finite verbs, not participles.



Dear Mr Gopi Sudarson,



In Sanskrit, verb root derived adjectives are treated as part of kridantas.



You might want to focus on the use of kridantas.



Best,



Nagaraj
