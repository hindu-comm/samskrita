Professor,  
  
re: "भागवते विद्यावतां परीक्षा!"  
  
  
As an English person interested in the subject, who resorts to a little help from *The Sanskrit Reader Companion*  
  
I learn that:  
  
 Sentence: भागवते विद्यावताम् परीक्षा  
  
      "भागवते विद्यावतां परीक्षा!" (bhagavate vidyavataṃ parīkṣa).  
  
  may be analysed as:  
  
 ***1110 Solutions***  
  
As one who has a very readable (and understandable) English language version of the Gita\*  
please can you be a little more specific in a matter that is of importance to many!  
  
Viz.  
  
* parīkṣa* vocative case of pari-kṣā  
  
 pari-kṣā  
 • f. (√kṣai) clay, mud, dirt, L. \[592,2\]  
  
 i.e. As clear as mud!  
  
 But somehow, I don't think that is the correct one out of those 1110 possibilities.
