Ken,  
  
 Language!  
  

Quote "Since letter 'a' has three sounds(bat,up,art) in English,..."  
  
Aside from transliteration issues, there is the small matter of English pronunciation.  
There are at least eight distinct 'a' sounds in (British) English, all commonly occurring in everyday speech.  
  
The OTD (Oxford Talking Dictionary) lists them in its Key to the Pronunciation using the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet).  
  
Webster's (American) English, likewise.  
  
As for *Schwa*, a word not in too many peoples vocabulary (I needed to look it up) has but the one 'a' sound (as in alone, sofa or along). It is used as an unstressed syllables.  
  
The *svarita* or grave mark ⟨◌̀⟩ is something else, it marks a sing-song (low-high) pitch, regardless of the sounded vowel.  
  
Anyway, it would be kinder to your phonetically challenged readers, were you identify the transliterations schemes - and format (pada-chedda?) used.  
  
Taff,
