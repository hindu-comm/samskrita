Hi All,

  

This roman transliteration is so much confusing if you want to learn Samskrut that I will try to explain with single word here.

  

Yog = योग्

Yoga= योग

Yogaa=योगा

  

In scripture it is written as योग and samskrut speaking people says योग. But English speaking person **writes Yoga** but **speaks योगा. So he writes correct but speaks it wrong.**

  

And here I am not discussing hruwa,pluta, dhirga ह्रस्व प्लुत दीर्घ

**  
**

**Warm Regards**

**Hari**
