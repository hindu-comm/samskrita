Dear Taff,

  

Apart from pronunciation. I think choice of letters to write the words is not correct.

  

Options 1

क् = ???

क = k

का = ka

  

  

or

  

Option 2

  

क् = k

क = ka

का = kaa

  

कि = Ki

की = Kii

कु = Ku

कू = Kuu

के = Ke

कै = Kai

को = Ko

कौ = Kau

  

I think option 2 makes more sense.

  

  

In English the concept of letter is completely different than Samskrut. Pure consonant in samskrut is क् not क. Because क has Maatra of अ. This maatra of अ in English is written as "a"

  

Since the time we started using roman for writing Devnagari we are following wrong convention (as per me) so we are convinced today this is right.

  

For example my name is हरि प्रसाद but I write as Hari Prasad.

  

If I write this correct in roman then it should be "Hari Prasaada"

  

Warm Regards

Hari
