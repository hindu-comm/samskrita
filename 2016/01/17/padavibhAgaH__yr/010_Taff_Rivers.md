 Hari,  

"But English speaking person **writes Yoga** but **speaks योगा. So he writes correct but speaks it wrong."**  
  

 It's a big big world!  
 It's not so much about right or wrong pronunciation, much more about regional accents.  
  
Is that an American drawl I hear?  
When I travelled there, North to South the vowels lengthened as I went.  
  
Likewise for British English - South Eastern regions - London area, tend to lengthen their vowels, they shorthen as you move North or West.  
  
No two Sanskrit Guru aah the same.  
  
One's aah's are as distinctive as fingerprints!  
  
And among the many Indian nationals I encountered while working in Saudi Arabia, some used Victorian English, some BBC English. The well travelled Indian there, will even know that there ain't no BBC English no more.  
  
Variety is the spice of life.  
  
Cheers,  

 Taff
