Dear Friends,

Namaste. Why there is doubt whether Samskritam will be a spoken language in India or not ? It will definitely be.  Only there should be "Sankalpa" to bring it back to that stage for all of us. Once upon a time, it was there. But due to political changes in the country due to foreign invasions and willful replacement of the national language in the country by English by Britishers, Samskrit had been neglected for centuries.

Even after our achieving Independence, it was neglected due to political reasons. Only after the birth of Samskrita Bharati due to the efforts of some patriatic people like Sri Chamu Krishna Sastry and his fiends spoken samskritam classes are conducted through out India for the last three and half decades by devoted volunteers. Now there are lakhs and lakhs of people know , understand simple Samskrit and speak at home too. If only our MPs in Parliament decide to declare Samskrit as our National and Official language of the country, then with in a decade we can enjoy hearing the sounds of this beautiful language every-where.

Let us work in that direction please.

Regards,

D.Ramakrishnan.
