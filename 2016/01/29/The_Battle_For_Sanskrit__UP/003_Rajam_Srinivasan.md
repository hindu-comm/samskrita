Sir;

  

Thank you for your note. I wish I was also there. 

  

Here is a response (rather an insignificant one) to your anguished question about Sanskrit ever becoming a spoken language. I have heard that there is a village in Mysore (Mettur?) where the residents do speak the language. I also have heard that there is similar village (Juhi?) in Uttar Pradesh. Going by these examples I have a fervent and prayerful wish that there will be similar little patches in the Indian landscape, which will continue to spread, grow and expand to cover the whole of India. If English, a totally alien (to the Indians) could become a spoken language in India, why not Samskrit, which is not an "enemy"! (The vehemently negativeway in which some people respond to any positiveidea about Samskrit, appears as if it is the arch "enemy" of India, Indians and the biggest hurdle in our path to pregress and welfare.)

  

Of course, English was perceived as anecessary tool to survive and to co-exist with very powerful alien rulers. Also given the opportunity,manyIndians have some innate capacity to enjoy and revel in beauty regardless of its origin. Who can resist the beauty of Shakespear or Wordsworth or Shelly? Or for that matter, given a chance to understand who in India is capable of not savouring Jayadeva, or Surdas or Tulasi or any number of non-English writings? 

  

So, there should be no doubt thatSamskrit which is such averitable ocean of beauty will catch our psyche (after all many foreigners have fallen for it) and we will embrace it lovingly, admiringly and happily!
But it takes non-stop efforts to promote it in every which way we can.
Perhaps we can induce film industry to use at least 1 or 2 Samskrit language lyrics in each movie in every Indian language (including Nepali movies)! Perhaps our commercial/industrial enterprises will contribute financially to promote Samskrit; by donating to Samskrit oriented art programs, encourage art-institutions to invest their time/energy and efforts to create "Samskritized or Samskritistic" programs. Some companies in the U.S. give their employees "yoga or meditation" breaks; perhaps Indian companies can make similar "Samskrit" breaks!!

  

There are so many things that could be done![&#X1f60a](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/45710d8e3c461/OutlookEmoji-&amp;%23X1f60a.png?part=0.1&view=1)!!

  

Regards,

  

Iyengar
