Dear Friends ,

  

Attended the book release ceremony of Rajiv Malhotra's The Battle for Sanskrit arranged by Sanskrita Bharati at Veer Savarkar Auditorium , Dadar , yesterday .

  

Some of the speakers spoke in Sanskrit . However the only one whose Sanskrit speech seemed natural enough was Dr. Gauri Mahulikar . In case of others , the it seemed a heavy effort to speak Sanskrit . Also the emotions expressed and the words spoken did not match at times .

  

This made me think , " Are the days of Sankrit language as spoken language over ? " I will like your comments on the above issue .

  

I also came up with another perspective of the same question . It may not become a spoken language ever but it is great as a medium of communication .

  

We can easily communicate thoughts , concepts , and ideas in Sanskrit even if we are not well versed in spoken Sanskrit .

  

Friends , please let me know your thoughts .

  

By the way Rajiv Malhotra will have two more functions in Mumbai . These are public events with no charge .

  

Jan 29  TISS Chembur 6:30 to 8:30 pm

Jan 30  Welingkar Institute 6:30 to 9:30 pm

  

  
  
  
Regards ,
