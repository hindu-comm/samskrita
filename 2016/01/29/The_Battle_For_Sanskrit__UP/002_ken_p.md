**Prose**is a form of[language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language")that exhibits a[grammatical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax")and a[natural flow of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_speech "Natural speech")rather than a[rhythmic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(poetry) "Meter (poetry)")(as in traditional[poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry")). While there are[critical debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_theory "Literary theory")on the construction of prose, its simplicity and loosely defined structure have led to its adoption for use in the majority of spoken dialogue, factual discourse and both topical and fictional writing. It is commonly used, for example, in[literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature"),[newspapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspapers "Newspapers"),[magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazines "Magazines"),[encyclopedias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedias "Encyclopedias"),[broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting "Broadcasting"),[film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film "Film"),[history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History "History"),[philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"),[law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law")and other forms of communication.
