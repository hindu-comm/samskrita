Hello Friends,

  

Can anybody here help me in connecting to a source (book, video, audio or teacher in Bangalore or online) who can teach me Panini Grammar through Hindi and Devnagari.

  

When I am learning Samskrut grammar through english I am making huge pronunciation misstates. So I prefer learning in Hindi.

  

I personally feel learning Samskrut through any of the Indian language is the best way. English is when you do not have any choice.

  

Your help would be highly appreciated.

  

Warm Regards

Hari
