Five Meritorious Acts as per an Ashokan inscription (Rock Edict II)

  

साधु मातापितुसु सुसुसा

मित संथुत नातिक्यानां

चा बंभन-समनानं च साधु दाने

पानानां अनालंभे साधु

अपवियता अपभंडता च साधु

  

sādhu mātāpitusu sususā

mita-saṃthuta-nātikyānaṃ

cā bambhana-samanānam ca sādhu dāne

pānānaṃ anālambhe sādhu

apaviyatā apabhaṃḍatā ca sādhu

  

श्रेष्ठ पुण्यकारी हैसेवा मातापिता की

श्लाघनीय है दान मित्रों व बन्धुओं को

हैसुकृत दान ब्राह्मणों तथा श्रमणों को

अत्युत्तमहैप्राणों से अनासक्ति

अल्पव्ययिता एवं अपरिग्रह





हैं



प्रशंसनीय



  

It is meritorious to serve one's parents

And to make donations to friends and relatives, brahmanas and shramanas.

It is indeed meritorious to be detached from worldly life

And wise to spend modestly and retain few possessions.

  

NB What powerful words! It gives us a fair idea of the mindset of Emperor Ashoka, India's second great emperor after

Emperor 

Candragupta Maurya. His words stand the test of time.  
  
There seems to be a false impression that Indians do not have a written history. We have a wealth of inscriptions and epigraphs which narrate our history quite brilliantly. Of these, the Ashokan inscriptions are the oldest. They were written in Shauraseni Prakrit using the Brahmi script.
