Namaste!!

  

I was wondering if interpreting Shukra Niti for the benefit of leadership and management practices is a good idea. I have seen some work on the subject, but due to my limited knowledge of Sanskrit, I would appreciate it very much if someone here can guide me to references on the life and times of A. Shukra, his work and Shukra Niti.

  

Pranam, and thanks!
