### Dear Andrés Alaní, 

### You may also consult the Hindi medical terms created by Indian Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT) . As you must be aware, the policy of the commission is to extract technical terms from vast amount of Sanskrit literature using Sanskrit grammar. But they also take some terms as such (what they call 'international terms' ) .
