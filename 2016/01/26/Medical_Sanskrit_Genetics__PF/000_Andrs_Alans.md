Hello everyone.  
I'm a physician looking forward a Medical Genetics speciality. I haven't found books or good compilations for medical terms in sanskrit (other than scarce entries on [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) and others). In medicine we use latin and greek as our basic roots for our "medical terms", but in my opinion sanskrit is so much better suited for this job. Anyways, my idea is to completely rename and re-establish Genetic Terms using sanskrit. I'm just beginning to see all of the capabilities this amazing language can bring us. I began trying to name some basic concepts. I wanted to experiment and I came up with some of them, but I'm not sure if my tentative compounds are correct. I will put the official English term and my created sanskrit word. At the end you'll find some brief definitions of the English terms in case you are not familiar with some of the genetic concepts. This renaming may sound useless, but correctly classifying concepts makes a huge difference in learning and assimilating information. Our current terminology is not optimal so I want to use sanskrit to organize my thoughts and purify the concepts I'm dealing with.  
  

[TABLE]

  
  
  
Genome: the whole DNA molecule of an organism  
Chromosome: the structures in which DNA is separated  
Gene: a part of the DNA molecule that has a purpose (can be regulatory or protein blueprint)  
Manifested gene mutation: Gene mutations that affect the patient  
Silent gene mutations: Changes in DNA sequence that do not damage the patient  
  
Gene Penetrance: It measures *the odds of having a disease* if you have the mutated gene.  
Gene Expression: It measures the intensity, *once the disease is established*  
This 2 terms are often confused. If a gene has 100% penetrance it means that if you have the mutation... 100% probability the disease will struck you. If it has low expression though, you can get only mild symptoms.  
  
Anticipation: the fact that some diseases appear with more expression and at a younger age. Example: Huntington's. If you pass on the condition, your son will develop the disease at a younger age than you, and he will have more symptoms.  
Heterochromatin: A piece of the DNA molecule that is bound to proteins and is inactive, meaning its information is not being copied or used. it happens to appear with different colors when you see it, hence the name.  
Euchromatin: Piece or part of the DNA molecule that is free and is active. Is being currently transcribed and used.  
Allele: One of the multiple normal variants of a characteristic or trait  
Polymorphism: The fact that some traits have multiple variants  
  
  
I encourage terms that name concepts according to the functional properties of it, not based on some other random or unrelated characteristics. Example: Heterochromatin... the term is logical, but I'm not interested in whether the chromatin looks the same color or not when seen, I prefer to name that concept according to its function (being inactive/supressed). We are full of all these nonsensical terminology in medicine. We also sometimes use greek, sometimes latin, everything mixed up.... What a linguistic mess we've done !  for me this is another motivation to learn enough sanskrit to be capable of establishing new classifications and terminology, even if I only use it myself. It's such a pity that science hasn't yet adopted sanskrit as the basic language. I have nothing against latin, I'm mexican so my native language is latin-derived and I love it, but still... Sanskrit just doesn’t even have a rival language in terms of logically naming and classifying thoughts, period.  
  
I would appreciate if you could orient me on the compounds, whether they seem logical or not, or if the morpheme order fits properly. I would also appreciate your suggestions.  
If you know some resources with compilation of medical or genetic terms, please let me know.  
  
Thanks in advance !  
Saludos.
