नमांसि सर्वेभ्यः !

Glad to inform that [study of verses 2-64 to 2-68](https://study1geetaa2sanskrit.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/studying-geetaa-and-sanskrit-together-chapter-2-verses-64-to-68/) is presented.

In my interpretation, I have dared to differ. Take it or leave it. But please do not comment, because any discussion will only go on and on.

If I have committed any basic mistakes, such comments are welcome. But no discussion please, on the interpretation.

Usually I am receptive to all comments. But in this instance, I am not inviting comments, please.
