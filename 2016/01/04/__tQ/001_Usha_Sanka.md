##### Five Fundamental Themes Vivekananda And Ambedkar Would Agree On

<http://swarajyamag.com/culture/five-fundamental-themes-vivekananda-and-ambedkar-would-agree-on/>

### **3. The Importance And Utility Of Sanskrit**

As a modern nation building process started churning, both Swami Vivekananda and Ambedkar started exploring in their own ways the cultural and social integration of the Indian masses. To spiritually and culturally empower the masses and remove the birth-based disabilities and discriminations that the social stagnation had created, they advocated Sanskrit as an ideal tool of emancipation. Vivekananda saw a social mission in Sanskrit education:

> *My idea is first of all to bring out the gems of spirituality … from > the still more inaccessible chest, the language in which it is > preserved, the incrustation of centuries of Sanskrit words. In one > word, I want to make them popular. … The great difficulty in the way > is the Sanskrit language — the glorious language of ours; and this > difficulty cannot be removed until — if it is possible — the whole of > our nation are good Sanskrit scholars. …. Sanskrit education must go > on along with it, because the very sound of Sanskrit words gives a > prestige and a power and a strength to the race. The attempts of the > great Ramanuja and of Chaitanya and of Kabir to raise the lower > classes of India show that marvelous results were attained during the > lifetime of those great prophets; …*

Ambedkar seemed to have taken the cue from Swami Vivekananda. In Babasaheb’s opinion, Persian stands no comparison with Sanskrit as the latter is according to him “the golden treasure of epics, the cradle of grammar, politics and philosophy and the home of logic, dramas and criticism”. Author Makarand Paranjape observes that the idea of making Sanskrit…

> *..not only India’s national language but also India’s official > language can be traced back to none other than India’s first law > minister Dr BR Ambedkar. Following the Independence of India in August > 1947, the Constituent Assembly of India had debated the language > question extensively. After months of debate, Hindi with the > Devanagari script was clearly emerging as the favourite. There was a > draft to this effect with proviso to continue using English for > official purposes for a period of an additional fifteen years. It was > in this context that in September 1949 the then law minister Dr BR > Ambedkar moved an amendment to substitute Hindi with Sanskrit so as to > make Sanskrit the official language of India*.
