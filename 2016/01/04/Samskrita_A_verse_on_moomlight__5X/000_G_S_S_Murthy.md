Dear all,

  

This beautiful verse was quoted in the editorial of Daily Sudharma some time back.

The meaning of second line is not too clear to me. Secondly I would like to know the source of this verse. Which work? Who is the poet? I shall be thankful for any help.

“कपाले मार्जारः पय इति करान् लेढि शशिनः

तरुच्छिन्नप्रोतान् बिसमिति करी सङ्कलयति ।

रतान्ते तल्पस्थान् हरति वनिताप्यंशुकमिति

प्रभामत्तश्चन्द्रः जगदिदमहो विभ्रमयति ॥“

Warm regards,

Murthy
