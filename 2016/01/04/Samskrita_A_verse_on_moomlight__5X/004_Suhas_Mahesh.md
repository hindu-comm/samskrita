The verse being discussed is #905 in VidyAkara's subhAshita-ratna-kosha. I'm posting the translation by Ingalls:  
  

The cat, thinking its rays are milk,  
licks them from the dish;  
the elephant, seeing them woven through the lattice of the trees, takes them for lotus stems;  
the damsel after love would draw them from her couch  
as if they were her dress:  
see how the moon in its pride of light  
has cozened all the world.  
  
Ingalls says that the verse could be from Bhasa. I'm not aware of the reasoning behind this claim.
