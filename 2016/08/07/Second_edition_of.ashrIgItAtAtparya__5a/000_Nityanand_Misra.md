***About the book***

\`Śrīgītātātparya’ is a Hindi essay, with some parts in Sanskrit. It was authored by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya in August 1985, when he was known by the name \`Rāmabhadradāsa’. The first edition of the work, published in 1985, received ‘praśasti’-s from Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Śivarāmācārya, Jagadguru Nimbārkācārya Śrīrādhāsarveśvara Śaraṇadevācārya, Jagadguru Śaṅkarācārya Svāmī Svarūpānanda Sarasvatī, Gaṅgādāsa Mahārāja, Rāmacaraṇadāsa Phalāhārī Mahārāja, and Ācārya Rāmaprasāda Tripāṭhī. The current book is the second edition of \`Śrīgītātātparya’. \`Śrīgītātātparya’ consists of around 40,000 words and is divided into three sections called ‘unmeṣa’-s. The first ‘unmeṣa’ arrives at ‘śaraṇāgati’ as the ‘tātparya’ (essence) of the ‘Bhagavadgītā’ using the evidence of the six indicator marks (‘upakramopasaṁhāra’, ‘abhyāsa’, ‘apūrvatā’, ‘phala’, ‘arthavāda’, and ‘upapatti’) of the ‘Mīmāṁsaka’-s. The second ‘unmeṣa’ arrives at ‘śaraṇāgati’ as the ‘tātparya’ of all the eighteen chapters of the ‘Bhagavadgītā’. The third ‘unmeṣa’ is a critique of ‘tātparya’ of the ‘Bhagavadgītā’ as established by various philosophers, political leaders, and sādhu-s andsaints.
