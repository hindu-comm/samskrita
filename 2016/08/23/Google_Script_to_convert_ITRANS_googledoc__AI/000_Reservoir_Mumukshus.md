Namaste,

  

We are a group of students learning Sanskrit and Vedic texts. We come from different parts of India, so language conversion is a challenge.

  

There is this ITRANS script available in Github (<https://github.com/tjheeta/wordpress-itrans/blob/master/sanscript.js>) Has anyone used this ... or anything similar ... as a googlescript to convert an google doc (like this [Medha Suktham](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wozM2wukka6eztIOi5Jnn0heWRm17aXj6IbGmNOedRM)) with ITRANS to other Indic languages via a drop-down.

  

Dhanyawad.
