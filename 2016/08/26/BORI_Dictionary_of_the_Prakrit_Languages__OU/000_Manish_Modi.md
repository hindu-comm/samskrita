It was felt for a long time that there was no comprehensive and critical dictionary of Prakrit. Such a dictionary would not only promote the study of Prakrit, but also help and promote Jain studies.

  

This is the best, most comprehensive and exhaustively researched Prakrit dictionary.

  

The Method:

-   Each Prakrit word is typed in Devanagari and Roman.

-   Then, a Sanskrit synonym for the Prakrit word is given in Roman.

-   This is followed by an exhaustive English explanation of the Prakrit
    term along with relevant Prakrit citations.

  

The dictionary follows stringent academic standards. Unfortunately, the process is extremely slow. And after so many years, we have only come up to the vowel ‘ओ’ (‘o’). We hope that the rest of the dictionary will proceed more rapidly.

  

The contents of the Dictionary are as under:
