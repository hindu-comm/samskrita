The 3rd avarana cakra is called samkshobhana cakra in sri chakram.

What is its meaning?

A.Sundaram Iyer book gives the meaning as Agitation.

  

Remaining 8 cakras have very clear meaning like sarvasa paripuraka, sakalasaubhagyadayaka etc.,  

  

If you say sarvaasaparipuraka it fulfills all desires, similarly if you say sakalasaubhagyadayaka it gives all auspicious things. In the same way whether one will get good agitation with samskhobhanam...

  

What does agitation /violent shock or commotion denote here?
