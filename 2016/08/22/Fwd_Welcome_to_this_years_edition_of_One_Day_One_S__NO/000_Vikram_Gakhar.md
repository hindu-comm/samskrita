Dear #PBChamps,

  

Thank you so much for registering to be a #PBChamp this year. As always, many of our old champions join us to take this year's story wide and far... and a huge welcome to all our new champions.

  

This year's chosen book is [The Elephant Bird](https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/1101-the-elephant-bird) (written by Arefa Tehsin and illustrated by Sonal Goyal And Sumit Sakhuja. A story about a magical bird, and a brave and curious child! This story could be used to talk about themes of friendship, courage, endangered species and more. You could also turn it into a play and involve kids in your storytelling session. Or tweak it a little to do your version of the story with tons of different characters and avataars.

  

**Download an e-copy of the book** (many of you have signed up for the e-copy. Please download the book in your preferred language. Also, if you are waiting to receive your book, you can still download and read the book while you wait for the book to arrive)

**Translate the story into your language :**

This year, translating the story into your own language is much easier than previous years. You can use our story platform (StoryWeaver) to do this. We've already spotted a community translation in Sanskrit (<http://bit.ly/2b3fW07>) and we know that a few more languages will be joining the list. If you are a translator and want to share the story in your own language, you can use the following guide :<https://storyweaver.org.in/translate>

  

**For new #PBChamps**

The FAQs on the blog post mentions everything (<http://bit.ly/2biZGf1>). There are hardly any rules and that is the beauty of it - you decide how you want to create your session, what you want to do, who you want to tell the story to, when you want to do it. Also, you can go through the champions blog to see ideas from previous sessions :<http://champions.prathambooks.org/>

  

**Champion's hangout**

Last year we saw many champions sharing lovely ideas about what they would do at their sessions. At Pratham Books, we love sharing and collaboration! This year, we've also created a Facebook event page so you can share all your ideas, pictures and suggestions there with other champions. Join the event :

*<https://www.facebook.com/events/547942532074715/>*  

(if you aren't on Facebook, you should still be able to see the suggestions coming in). Older #PBChamps - start using the FB event page with suggestions please - to encourage the new #PBChamps and to show them how awesome this lovely tribe is.

  

**Spread the word**

The tribe of champions continue to grow and we want more storytellers to join us. So, help us spread the word. Tell them about your own #PBChamps experience or ask someone else to join you on your session.

-   Share the following blog post so they can find out what they need
    to do :
    <http://blog.prathambooks.org/2016/08/the-pbchamps-programme-is-back.html>  
-   Invite them to the FB page
    :*<https://www.facebook.com/events/547942532074715/>* -   If you tell them about it on Twitter, tag us @prathambooks (use the
    hashtag #PBChamps). We are also @pratham.books on Instagram.

**The Book Party**

For the first year, we are running a fundraiser to support this campaign. It would be great if you could share this campaign through your own networks :
