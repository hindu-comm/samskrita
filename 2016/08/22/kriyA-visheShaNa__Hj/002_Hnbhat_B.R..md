Depends on the context.

Adjectives can be used as adverbs.

सुन्दरः पुरुषः सुन्दरं गायति।

Beautiful man sings beautifully.

The general rule क्रियाविशेषणानां च क्लीबतेष्यते So in the second example

बालकः उत्तमम् अस्ति can mean as you say.  
  
In the first example as it is the same अव्यय and does not change its form  

\> (1) बालकः सम्यक् अस्ति

Can the boy is perfect and there is no verb to be qualified.

बालकः सम्यक् गायति would mean the boy sings perfectly.

Where did you get such an idea? Both भवति and अस्ति are verbs meaning to be and need not take adverbs like गायति, पठति. In English also the verbs do not take adverb.

You cannot say The boy is perfectly, but The boy is perfect or becomes perfect.
