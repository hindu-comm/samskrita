namaste,

  

\>\> More generally, can kriyA-visheShaNas be used with the "भू" dhatu? If yes, can you provide some additional examples?  
  
\> Where did you get such an idea? Both भवति and अस्ति are verbs meaning to be and need not take adverbs like गायति, पठति.  

  

  

Perfect. Thank you for clearing up my doubt.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
