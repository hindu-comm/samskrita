namaste,

  

I have a couple of simple questions which revolve around kriyA-visheShaNa.  

  

\(1\) बालकः सम्यक् अस्ति

  

In sentence #1, is the word "सम्यक्" an avyaya? Is it also a kriyA-visheShaNa?

  

  

\(2\) बालकः उत्तमम् अस्ति

  

Is sentence #2 grammatically correct in the sense of "the boy is well"?

  

  

More generally, can kriyA-visheShaNas be used with the "भू" dhatu? If yes, can you provide some additional examples?  

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
