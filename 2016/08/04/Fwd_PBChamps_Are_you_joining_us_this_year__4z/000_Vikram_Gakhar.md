Dear #PBChamps,  

  

How have you been?Hope you all have been doing well.We are extremely excited to share that our annual One Day-One Story campaign is back and we hope to see your name on this year's list of #PBChamps.

  

International Literacy Day is on 8th September, but we are celebrating the**'One Day-One Story' **campaign on a weekend before or after that date (as it is Saturday and more people can join us on this day). But like you already know, the celebration is more important than the date.  

  

The book we've chosen for this year's story is 'The Elephant Bird' - written by Arefa Tehsin, illustrated by Sonal Goyal and Sumit Sakhuja. A story about a magical bird, and a brave and curious child. You can read the book here :<https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/1101-the-elephant-bird>.

  

Last year, 2500+ champions joined us and took 'The Boy and the Drum' to meet children across India. How many champions do you think we will have this year (we need all your help to get more people to help spread the joy of storytelling!)?  

  

**Here's the form to register :**

Also, for the first time, we are also using the Donate-a-Book platform to help us get more books to champions. It would be great if you could share this campaign through your own networks :
