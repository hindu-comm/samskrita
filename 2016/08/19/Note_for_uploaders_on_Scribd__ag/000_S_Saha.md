Scribd has now changed its policy for free accounts to download,since August 11th. It basically does not allow them to download even if they upload free documents,requiring them to enter their credit card numbers for a 1 month free trial and charging $8.99 from then onwards.  
  
Uploaders to Scribd,please note.(and upload to [archive.org](http://archive.org) instead,that would be better for a lot of us please).
