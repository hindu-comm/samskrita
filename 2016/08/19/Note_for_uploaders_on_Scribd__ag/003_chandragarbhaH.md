Apologies everyone. Scribd has actually made the download link less noticeable. Instead of the download link in the normal place,they place huge payment notifications and the actual download link(in return for uploading) is pushed to the very bottom. I have highlighted where the download link actually is in the red box in the image I am attaching along with this message.
