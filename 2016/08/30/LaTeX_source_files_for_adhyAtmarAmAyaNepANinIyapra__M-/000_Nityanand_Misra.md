Dear list members

  

Several people had requested me for theLaTeX source files for the book[Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe’](https://www.academia.edu/25018408/Adhy%C4%81tmar%C4%81m%C4%81ya%E1%B9%87e_Ap%C4%81%E1%B9%87in%C4%AByaprayog%C4%81%E1%B9%87%C4%81%E1%B9%83_Vimar%C5%9Ba%E1%B8%A5)[](https://www.academia.edu/25018408/Adhy%C4%81tmar%C4%81m%C4%81ya%E1%B9%87e_Ap%C4%81%E1%B9%87in%C4%AByaprayog%C4%81%E1%B9%87%C4%81%E1%B9%83_Vimar%C5%9Ba%E1%B8%A5)[pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ](https://www.academia.edu/25018408/Adhy%C4%81tmar%C4%81m%C4%81ya%E1%B9%87e_Ap%C4%81%E1%B9%87in%C4%AByaprayog%C4%81%E1%B9%87%C4%81%E1%B9%83_Vimar%C5%9Ba%E1%B8%A5). I shared the source files with them, and decided to release all the LaTeX source files under GNU General Public License.The source files are attached with this email and are also available under<https://sites.google.com/site/nmisra/ARAPV.zip>

  

To compile the PDFs,unzip the ARAPV.zip file and follow the instructions in the steps.txt file.

  

Apart from the GNU GPL comment block, the source files do not have any comments. I currently do not have the time to document, maintain, or improve the source.

  

Hopefully the source files will helppeople typesetting Hindi or Sanskrit works (books/theses) in LaTeX.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
