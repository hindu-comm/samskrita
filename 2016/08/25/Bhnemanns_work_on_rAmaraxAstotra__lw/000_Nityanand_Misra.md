Dear list members

  

I am looking for a digital or print copy of

  

Gudrun Bühnemann (1983). “Budha-Kauśika's Rāmarakṣāstotra. A Contribution to the Study of Sanskrit Devotional Poetry.” Publications of the De Nobili Research Library, Vol. X., pp. 127. Vienna: De Nobili Research Library. AS 280.

  

Would appreciate any pointers.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
