Dear Mr. Valerio Virgini,

  

Firstly, I have no doctoral qualification. I take such address by you as appreciation of my work.

  

Thinking of पुनर्जन्म I had in mind the same पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते (गीता 8-16) This can as well be understood as पुनः जन्म न विद्यते taking पुनः as the commonplace अव्ययम्with no change in meaning.

  

Your mention of केवल-समास prompted me to get its definition at <http://www.sanskritjagat.co.in/2011/09/sanskrit-vyakarnam-grammer-samas.html> asतत्‍पुरुषादिसंज्ञाविनिर्मुक्‍त: समाससंज्ञामात्रयुक्‍त: केवलसमास: ।अर्थात् यस्‍य समासस्‍य नास्ति नाम कश्चित् (should be किञ्चित्)स: समास: केवलसमास: इति अभिधीयते (ज्ञायते). Looks likeपुनर्जन्म does qualify to be considered as केवल-समास

  

Mr. V Sadagopan has quoted from शब्दकल्पद्रुम -पुनर्भूयो जन्म =पुनर्जन्म Here the word भूयः intrigues me. I think it should rather be पुनर्भूयंजन्म Sinceजन्म is neuter, it ought to be भूयम् not भूयः. Sinceभूयः is अव्ययम् that too,fairly synonymous withपुनः, it cannot be the लुप्तपदम् Since he has quoted from शब्दकल्पद्रुम, he may please check up whether his copy of शब्दकल्पद्रुम is erroneous.

  

Since you have mentioned your thought of working onगीता in Italian, I got this reference, which may interest you -<http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/index-italian.html>
