Dear Mr. Valerio Virgini,

  

I think in most instances it can be taken simply as a सन्धिः of पुनः+ जन्म, whereपुनः is an indeclinable andजन्म a noun.

  

Compound words beginning with an indeclinablebecome अव्ययीभाव-type compounds e. g. यथावकाशम् (= as convenient, time permitting).

  

One needs to check whether the indeclinable-part can be separated or not. In the case of पुनर्जन्म,पुनः can be separated without affecting the meaning. If so it need not be taken as a compound word.

  

It sounds like a compound, because the two words are often put consecutively i.e. conjoint.

  

सस्नेहम्  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः ।  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"
