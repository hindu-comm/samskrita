Some universities (for example Benares Hindu University) issues the original certificate in Sanskrit. But they give an English version (with emblem of University and signature also( I think)) if yoiu apply with an additional charge. If the certificate is translated by a person then how to get the authenticity and validity? If Bihar Sanskrit Shiksha Board does not give an English version, due to prejudice, then what to do.

If the certificate is to be produced to an organisation to prove the competency in Sanskrit, then a Sanskrit certificate in Devanagari should be acceptable, or are they also prejudiced?

Thanks.
