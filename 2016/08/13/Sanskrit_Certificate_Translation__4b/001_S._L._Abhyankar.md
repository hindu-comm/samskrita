नमस्ते श्रीमन् सीताराम-महोदय !

  

It should not be much difficult to translate a certificate. I guess the original certificate is in Sanskrit. It needs to be translated into English for the knowledge of whosoever in US, who need to know what the certificate means in English.

  

Translation can be done if a scanned copy or photo of the certificate is available.

  

सस्नेहम्  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः ।  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"
