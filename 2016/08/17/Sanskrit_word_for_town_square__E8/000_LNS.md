Can someone help me with the Sanskrit word for 'town square' or what is commonly refered to as 'chowk' in Hindi. Support references for this usage from literature will be really useful.  
  
I wanted to describe a Sanskrit pandit who was sightseeing yesterday at the Times Square in New York City.  
  
Thanks in advance,  
  
Srini
