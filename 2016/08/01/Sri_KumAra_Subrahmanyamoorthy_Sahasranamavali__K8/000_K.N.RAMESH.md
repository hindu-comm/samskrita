Dear Devotees,



Jai Shri Krishna!!!



I had sourced from Chidambaram Sri kumAra subrahmanyamUrthy sahasranAmAvali. It was in Devanagiri. Happy to inform you that with the grace of my Lord Shanmukha, this has been entered; errors removed and uploaded for your benefit. Please see the link given below and get this transliterated using thelanguage sign on the right hand top side of the menu bar:

Normally, the practice is to derive or decode the sahasranAmAvali from the stotra form. However, in this case, we were amazed when one of the elderly volunteers attempted to do this "reverse tethering" it worked well and came out beautifully with His blessings. You will now find that His wish has been fulfilled. Please get the stotra form derived from nAmAvali from this link:

Prayers to my Lord Shanmukha for your well being and prosperity.



Regards



Kaumaaram
