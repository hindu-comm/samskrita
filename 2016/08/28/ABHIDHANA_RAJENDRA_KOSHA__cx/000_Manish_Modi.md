The Original Work

  

‘Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha’ merits recognition as the 20th century’s finest encyclopedic work on Jainism. For generations of scholars, it remains the go-to encyclopedia on Jainism.

  

A result of the Herculean efforts of Acarya Rajendrasuri, it is a magnificent repository of citations sourced from the widest possible selection of Jain texts belonging to both, the Digambara as well as the Shvetambara traditions. It is a gigantic set of seven volumes, each running into thousands of pages. It covers a substantial selection of Prakrit terms, each explained in Sanskrit using several citations in Prakrit and Sanskrit taken from various Jain texts. It is a phenomenal achievement and deserves great encomia.

  

The Present Work

  

Unfortunately, the ‘Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha’ remains inaccessible to those who do not know Prakrit and Sanskrit. The present work is a faithful Hindi translation of the original work with the original citations removed for reasons of brevity. The result is a compact, handy dictionary of three volumes which gives the Sanskrit meaning and Hindi explanation of each Prakrit term.

  

The unique features of this dictionary are:

-   Prakrit/Sanskrit synonyms are provided wherever possible

-   The Hindi explanation provides the literal meaning of the Prakrit
    word, a Hindi translation of its Prakrit and Sanskrit definitions,
    the etymological roots of the Prakrit word and an analysis of its
    meaning

-   Linguistic details such as gender, tense, verb/noun/adjective have
    been provided for each Prakrit term

-   Cross references to the original Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha have been
    provided in many cases

-   References to citations from other Jain texts are given in some
    cases

  

We recommend this fine dictionary as a must have for any student of Ancient Indian Languages.
