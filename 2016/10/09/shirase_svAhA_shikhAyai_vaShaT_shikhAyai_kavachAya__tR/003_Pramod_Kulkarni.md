\> Hridayaadinyaasa is also called anganyaasa. anganyaasa and karanyaasa are viewed as supernatural ('occult'?) procedures of 'filling' the angas and karas with the supernatural power of the mantra. Invoking the dEvataa of the mantra into one's body and hands. Getting possessed by the dEvataa of the mantra. naarudrOrudramarchayEt is the template that can be applied to the archanaa of any dEvataa.

I am curious about their meaning and purpose and would like to get a clarification from a knowledgeable member here. Also what is the correct wording of this incantation?
