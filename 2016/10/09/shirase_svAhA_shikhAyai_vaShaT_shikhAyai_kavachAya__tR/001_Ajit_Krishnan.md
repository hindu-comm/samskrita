namaste,

  

The षडङ्गन्यास (which is what you are describing) has two parts: हृदयादिन्यासः and करन्यासः. The 6 हृदयादयः are हृदय, शिरः, शिखा, कवच, नेत्रत्रय, and अस्त्र. The 6 अङ्गुष्ठादयः are अङ्गुष्ठ, तर्जनी, मध्यमा, अनामिका, कनिष्ठिका, and करतल-करपृष्ठौ.  

  

The mantra for the devata prefixes each of these nyasas. This is done either by splitting the mantra into 6 parts (or sometimes 3 parts, with the sequence repeated twice), or by taking the bija for the devata and elongating it with आं, ईं, ऊं, ऐं, औं and अः.

  

Then come the nyasa statements themselves, which are composed of two parts: (a) the part of the body nyasa is performed in, and (b) the mantra-pallava, i.e. words like नमः, स्वाहा etc.

  

All of these have individual meanings and purposes that are combined together in the षडङ्गन्यास.

  

I haven't seen the meaning behind the करन्यास clearly explained anywhere, though various tantra texts map the five पृथिव्यादयः mahabhutas to the five fingers.

  

The meaning for the mantra pallavas is called out in some prayoga works as well as the प्रपञ्चसारसारसङ्ग्रह. The meaning behind the limbs in the षडङ्गन्यास, and it's link to the pallavas is explained in the प्रपञ्चसारतन्त्र.

  

I'll provide more detail later. The meaning behind the हृदयायिन्यास in particular is nice, though I don't know of any practitioners who actually employ it.
