\> वषट् वा वौषट् ?  

  

The former is used for शिखा, and the later for नेत्रत्रय.

  

Here is a karika for the mantra pallavas,taken from the book "mantra sangraham" available from [agamaacademy.org](http://agamaacademy.org) (in grantha script).

  

वषड्वश्या-फडुच्छाटे, हुं द्वेषे मारणेऽपि च ।

स्तम्भे च, वौषडाकर्षे, नमः संपत्करे तथा ।

स्वाहा शक्तिः, स्वधा पुष्टिरित्येते मन्त्रपल्लवाः ॥

  

And here is an explanation for the anga-nyasa, as found in the prapancha sara sara sangraha. A slightly different version appears in the prapancha sara tantra, but the content is the same.

  

हृदयं बुद्धिगम्यत्वात् प्रणामः स्यान्नमःपदम् ।

क्रियते हृदयेनातः बुद्धिगम्या नमस्कृतिः ॥

  

तुङ्गार्थः शिरसे चेति विषयाहरणे द्विठः ।

शिरो मन्त्रेण चेत्तुङ्गविषयाहृतिलक्षणा ॥

  

शिखा तेजः समुद्दिष्टा वषडित्यङ्गमुच्यते ।

तत्तेजोऽस्य तनुः प्रोक्ता शिखामन्त्रेण मन्त्रिभिः ॥

  

कव गृह्णन् इत्यस्माद्धातोः कवचसंभवः ।

हुं तेजस्तेजसा देहो गृह्यते कवचं ततः ॥

  

असुत्रासादिकौ धातू संक्षेपचलनार्थकौ ।

तेनानिष्टं समाक्षिप्य चालयेत् फट्पदाग्निना ॥

  

नेत्रं दृष्टिः समुद्दिष्टा वौषट् दर्शनमुच्यते ।

दर्शनं दृग्विषयेण स्यात् तत्तेजो नेत्रवाचनम् ॥

  

sasneham,
