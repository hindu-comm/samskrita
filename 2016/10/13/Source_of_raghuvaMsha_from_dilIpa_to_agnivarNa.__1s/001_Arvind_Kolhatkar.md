I have found a partial answer to my question.

  

Probably, Kalidasa has taken the names of kings from Padma Purana.
There are two views on this. Winternitz supports this view. A book by Hardatta Sarma, "Padmapurana and Kalidasa', available at DLI, supports this view. MM VV Mirashi in his 'Kalidasa' takes the opposite view.
According to himPadmapurana was composed after Raghuvansha was written and has borrowed the lineage from the latter.

  

In other words, the jury is still out ...
