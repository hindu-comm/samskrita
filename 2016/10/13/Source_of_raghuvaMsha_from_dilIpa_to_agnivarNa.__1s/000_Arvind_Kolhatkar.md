Dear Group,

  

The festival ofविजयादशमी is just over. In Maharashtra, it is associated with the custom of young boys and girls proffering leaves of theआपटा tree -Bauhinia racemosa -to the seniors. We are told that this custom has its origin in the story ofकौत्स and रघु, whereकौत्स has to giveगु्रुदक्षिणा to hisगु्रुand thatoffering leaves of theआपटा tree to senior persons represents the same act ofगु्रुदक्षिणा.
In the oldest textbooks of Marathi, dating back to 1860's, there was even a small poem about this custom and three lines of that poem are still widely remembered:

  

सोने लुटुनी सायंकाळी मोरू परतुनि आला

बहीण काशी येउनि दारी ओवाळी त्याला.

दसरा सण मोठा, नाही आनंदा तोटा.

  

A version of the same story also appears in Canto V ofरघुवंश. The story,as narrated inरघुवंश, is thatकौत्स, upon completing his apprenticeship, was asked by hisगुरु to bring as गु्रुदक्षिणा 14 crore pieces of gold coin. कौत्स did not have such a large amount and he approached रघु, well-known for his charity and reputation of never sending back a supplicant empty-handed, to give him this amount. Raghu did not have it in his treasury. He decided to demand it fromकुबेर and started war-like preparations to extract in from him. कुबेर, unwilling to put up a fight againstरघु, overnight poured out an amount much larger than14 crore pieces of gold coin, into the treasury ofरघु. (प्रातः प्रयाणाभिमुखाय तस्मै सविस्मयाः कोषगृहे नियुक्ताः ।हिरण्मयीं कोषगृहस्य मध्ये वृष्टिं शशंसुः पतितां नभस्तः ॥ ५-२९॥)  

  

The story now current has a few details more than whatरघुवंश tells us.
In the current story,कुबेर pours out a much larger amount, and that too, not into the treasury but on theआपटा tree. From it,कौत्स is given what he needs andरघु asks the populace to take away the excess.
This represents the 'loot' in the popular story. Giving of leaves of this tree by the young to the seniors representsगु्रुदक्षिणा. Kalidasa does not mention any tree, in his version the wealth falls directly into the treasury. There is also no mention in Kalidasa's version of any extra amount.

  

Hence my two queries. These are:

  

1) Can any scholar here point to the origin of the story in any Purana, Mahabharata etc.? How did theआपटा tree enter the story and where is the excess amount being carried away by the people mentioned? 

2) Kalidasa gives in all 29 names of the kings of theरघुवंश, fromदिलीप to अग्निवर्ण, as Kings of theरघु Dynasty. Where are all these names to be found in the ancient scriptures and what is Kalidasa's source of the whole story ofरघुवंश?

  

I am sure someone here will have the answers.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
