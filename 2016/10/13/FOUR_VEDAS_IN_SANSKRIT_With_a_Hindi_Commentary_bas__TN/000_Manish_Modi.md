Fortunately, several publications on the Vedas are available in the market today. There are various translations, most of them competent. We already distribute a few of the Hindi and English translations. But for a long time, a need has been felt to have the complete Sayana bhasya, the legendary Sanskrit commentary by Acarya Sayana, available in modern Hindi. Also, while most publications offer the original text of the Vedas, only one offered the original Vedic Sanskrit text along with the appropriate svaras {accents}. And even there, the accents are not accurately printed.

  

Nearly thirty years ago, a project was set in motion. To produce a set of Vedas that have the original Vedic Sanskrit text with appropriate accents, along with an exhaustive Hindi commentary, based on the original bhasya {exposition} of Acarya Sayana. And to fill a historical gap. Sayana’s exhaustive commentary was not available for chapters 11 to 16 of the Atharvaveda. A fresh commentary had to be written on these chapters. In addition, the excellent commentaries by Uvatamahidhara, Acarya Panini, Skanda Svami, Pandit Shripad Damodar Satavalekar and others had to be consulted and cited. Thus, a fresh exhaustive, traditionally sound and yet contemporary commentary on the Vedas had to be written.

  

Six leading Vedic scholars of India were involved in this project:

Acarya Dr Munshiram Sharma; Dr Janardan Gangadhar Ratate; Dr Sudhakar Malaviya; Dr Kunvar Chandraprakash Singh; Dr Maheshchandra Sharma and Pt Jatashankar Dikshit.

  

This text is the fruit of their labour and deliberations. It is an excellent, low priced edition of the four Vedas, along with a complete Hindi commentary based on the seminal bhasya by Acarya Sayana.

  

A volume-wise break up of this edition of the four Vedas is as under:

  

ऋग्वेद RGVEDA \| Set of 9 books \| 5946 pages
