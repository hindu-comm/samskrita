Could someone give me a pointer to the dhyAna shloka + karA.nga nyaasa for the vAnchA-kalpa gaNapati mantra?  
  

I searched in a Skt book called AmnAya-mandAra. It's not there.  

What I am referring to is a mantra with gaNapati + saubhAgya-panchadashi + gAyatri intertwined.  
  
  

I saw several mantra texts listed in the recent discussions. Hence hoping for an answer.  

Thanks,  

\- Sai.
