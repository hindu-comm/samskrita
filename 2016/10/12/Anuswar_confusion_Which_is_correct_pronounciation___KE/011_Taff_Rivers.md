Could it be that you are concerned with It what is calledantahsthaor intermediate sounds in Sanskrit?

  

This is a term applied to the semivowels, as standing between the consonants and vowels,

the peculiar euphonic combination and pronunciation of letters which prevails in different Śākhās or branches of the Vedas.  

  

As applied to ***bīja*** (and **maha**) **mantras** they are detailed the **Prātiśākhya [](http://goog_1470379570)**

However, it's probably simpler to listen directly to an audio of the particular***bīja.***

  

 Hope this helps,

  

Taff,
