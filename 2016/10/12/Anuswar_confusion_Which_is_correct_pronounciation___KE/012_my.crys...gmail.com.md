Well I am just trying to learn how to properly pronounce bij mantra .  
Indeed . If i can listen to authentic recorded version that would be great .  
But what ever is present on you tube is causing confusion . hence I am looking for literature to get rid of this confusion.  
for instance  
ऐं \> this mantra is pronounced as ang , and aim , now the question is which one is correct .

  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ta9R7RjQ_E>  
50.15 to 50.45  

in this video dr. shrimali is clearly stating one should pronounce it as ang .  
while there are many other video which is pronouncing it as aim .  
  
thanks for input though .
