Are you giving answer for hindi or sankrit .  
I need answer know about Sanskrit in the context of beej mantra .  
I am quite sure their pronunciation is different than that of standard hindi .  
  
there is a mantra "ॐ ऐं ह्रीं क्लीं"  
I have heard people pronounce is as  
om eim hrim clim  
and also  
om aing hring cling  
  
but i wish to know which one is correct .  
  
as for chandra bindu and anuswar I know the difference and I also know the pancham varn rule of hindi .  
  
अं \> am / ang..........ambar......... but also angur becaude of pancham varn rule.  
  
but what is real sound of अं as a varn . am or ang
