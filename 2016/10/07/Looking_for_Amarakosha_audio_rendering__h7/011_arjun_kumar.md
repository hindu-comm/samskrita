Hello,

  

Thanks for all the replies to my question, sorry for delay in responding.

  

Although few member replied in sanskrit and my sanskrit is not that great but it seems from all the replies that there does not exist complete audio rendering of Amarakosha. Sanskrit Bharati Amarakosha CD was good option but they also stopped selling it now.

  

Else I assume I will just try to memorize Amarakosha from the book itself.

  

Thanks

Arjun.
