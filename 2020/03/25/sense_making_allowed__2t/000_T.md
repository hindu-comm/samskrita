नमस्काराः!  

  

No sure if this is unfavorable to group policy, but I'm new here and to the language, so I hope you will forgive my faux pas. Admittedly there's neologism with स्वक्रमति, from sva- own + क्रमति to strive after, so the self-approach. the sentence should be something like "I go to that peerless place to self-approach"

  

अहं अनधिकस्यस्तापाय स्वक्रमतिगच्छमि

  

Does this make sense grammatically?

  

धन्यवादाः!

  

अहिम्सयरुचि (a wish with no violence?)
