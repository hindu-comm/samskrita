Relative position in place or time, make पूर्व to be declined as pronoun if it is not used as a name is general rule.

  

For the nine words - पूर्व, पर, अवर, दक्षिण, उत्तर, अपर, अधर, स्व, अन्तर - when they are used as a सर्वनाम, the ङसिँ and ङस्- प्रत्ययs after them are optionally converted to स्मात् and स्मिन् respectively

and in jas also optionally behaves as pronoun.

  

In other cases, it is normally considered as pronoun when it denotes relative position. as पूर्वस्मै, पूर्वेषाम्

In the cases mentioned by him it optionally declined like pronoun when it denotes relative position. as पूर्वे/पूवाः, पूर्वस्मात्/पूर्वात्, पूर्यस्मिन्/पूर्वे

  

  

In both, it should denote relative position.

  

When it denotes name of a person, it is never considered a pronoun, but as any noun like Rama.

  

Hope this makes clear.
