Dear list members,

  

Dear list members,

  

Firstly I hope everyone is well in these difficult times.

  

Secondly,

Verse 2 of the Devisuktam is:

  

रौद्रायै नमो नित्यायै गौर्यै धात्र्यै नमो नमः

  

ज्योत्स्नायै चेन्दुरूपिण्यै सुखायै सततं नमः

  

As far as I can see the metre is: (L = long, S = short)

  

L L L S  L L L L \| L L L L S L S L

  

 L L L L  S L L L \| S L L S S L S L

  

Is there an error in the metre in the second pada?

  

According to MacDonell's Sanskrit GrammarL L L S  LL L L \| isn't a correct variation of shloka meter.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
