A quest led to a discovery

  

The following verse of the Garuda puranam <https://sa.wikisource.org/s/8cv> is a part of a discourse on Vedanta Sadhana. The second half means: 'Brahma aham asmi aham brahma jnanam ajnana-vardhanam' = Aham brahma knowledge/realization 'increases' ignorance. 

उकारश्च अकारश्च मकारोयमृगद्वयः ।

ब्रह्माहमस्म्यहं ब्रह्मज्ञानमज्ञानवर्धनम् ॥ १,२३९.२४ ॥

  

Seeing this translation in an edition: 'The expressions Brahma aham asmi, aham brahma serve merely to create confusion' - I felt something is amiss here since the teaching preceding the verse is full of aham brahma asmi sadhana.

अहंब्रह्मास्मि वाक्योत्थज्ञानान्मोक्षो भवेन्नणाम् ॥ १,२३९.१ ॥

  

वाक्यज्ञानं भवेज्ज्ञानादहंब्रह्मपदार्थयोः ।

Upon making a search in the dictionary for the word 'vardh', I got to know that this also means ''cutting/dividing' apart from the common 'to increase...'

<https://kosha.sanskrit.today/word/sa/vardha>

  

वर्धः \[vardhḥ\], १ Cutting, dividing.Increasing, causing increase or prosperity.

Thus, the vardhanam in the verse means 'naashanam.'
