Krishna has other names that show endearment. One such name isलंगर or लंगरवा - the lame one.

  

Krisha is often portrayed as holding his flute to his lip and standing with one leg folded over the other. Devotees affectionately call this image of his as लंगडा बाळकृष्ण (in Marathi,) Krishna as लंगर or लंगरवा is met in compositions of Indian Classical Music, as for example, in the compositionलंगर कांकरिया जी न मारो in Raag Miyan ki Todi. Here his playmate Gopi's are coquetishly entreating his not to throw stones at them when are carrying waterpots from the River Jamuna on their heads.
