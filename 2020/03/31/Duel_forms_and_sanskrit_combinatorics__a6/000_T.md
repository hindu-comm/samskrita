Naskar,

  

Sorry for the second post, the last one contains an error:

  

For exposition in sutra:

  

Is it proper for two duel forms to stand alone like such:

  

ज्ञानाज्ञने सदनस्यमनाचित्रमनाचित्रस्यसदने ।  

  

Following this will be the combinatorics of the options:

  

Knowledge of the map of home/home of map

Unknown of map of home/home of map

As well as the Home of the map of knowledge and the map of the home of knowledge, etc.

  

All have a subject matter...however it would be helpful to know how many are cast, and how to cast how many.  

  

Many thanks!

  

Humbly following the wish for peace, begging pardon for the harm caused:

  

अहिंसा
