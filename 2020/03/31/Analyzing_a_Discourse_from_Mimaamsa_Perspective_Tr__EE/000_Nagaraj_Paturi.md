## Background

Interest in India’s sustainable Vedic practices is on the rise, which is evident from the growing following of Yoga and Ayurveda, worldwide. Authentic interpretation of India’s scientific knowledge embedded in shaastras requires training in three fundamental sciences called Pada, vaakya and pramaana shaastras which are Vyaakarana, Purva Mimaamsa and Nyaaya. Of these, Purva Mimaamsa is especially important due to its systematic approach to text interpretation. However, it is currently studied in its original context of Karma kanda interpretation only.

This course is a first-of-its-kind attempt to train young scholars on how to interpret any Indic Shaastra from a Mimaamsa perspective. Only such trained scholars can authentically interpret India’s scientific knowledge which is the need of the hour.

MIT SVS, Pune, is happy to launch this unique course in online mode to benefit the widest possible audience.
