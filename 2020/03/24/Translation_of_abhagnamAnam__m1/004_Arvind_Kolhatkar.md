One of the variations of this verse is:

  

यज्जीव्यते क्षणमपि प्रथितं मनुष्यैर्विज्ञानविक्रमयशोभिरभज्यमानम् ।

तन्नाम जीवितमिह प्रवदन्ति सन्त: काकोऽपि जीवति चिराय बलिं च भुङ्क्ते ॥

  

Life lived for even a moment by humans, if if it has in it knowledge, success and fame, is called 'life' by the great people. (Bereft of these) even a crow can live forever and survive on offerings (ritually left on the threshhold of the door by householders prior to the midday meal.)
