Harry,

  

The verse as reproduced by me is as I remember it and I do not recollect when and from which source I had learnt it. However, the anthologyसुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार reproduces (almost) the same version as mine at Verse No 9, p. 98 under the heading उदरपूरणदूषणम्, सेवकनिन्दा, जीवितसाफल्यम्. The same version is also seen in another anthology,सुभाषितरत्नाकर, compliled by Krishnashastri Bhatavadekar.

  

As is well-known, the text of has been copied and recopied countless number of times over the centuries since it was created by an unknown author. It is, therefore, but natural that several version exist of verses in it. Edgerton, whose book you have followed, gives in his Introduction a detailed outline of the spread of the book all over the world and in about 60 languages, ancient and modern.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
