Thank you Arvinbd,

  

Unfortunately this Kālabhairavāṣṭakams a different hymn than theMahākālabhairavāṣṭakam

What I need is a cross-check for theMahākālabhairavāṣṭakam in [sanskrit-documents.org](http://sanskrit-documents.org)

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_shiva/mahAkAlabhairavAShTakam.html?lang=iast>

Unfortunately every version I've found on the internet is identical to this and I think it has some mistakes in itl. So I'm looking for this hymn in a printed edition to cross-check it.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
