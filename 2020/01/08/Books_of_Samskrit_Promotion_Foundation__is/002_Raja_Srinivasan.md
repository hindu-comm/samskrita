Thank you swamin. I am interested in this set. Can I get more details on these books? Details of authors, commentaries included, translators, publishers etc would help me decide if I need all 26 of them or a selected handful. Also details on how to obtain them.

  

Thanks & Regards

Raja Srinivasan
