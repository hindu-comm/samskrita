Thank you Sundar,

  

The conjugation generator you've used<http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/>

gives the conjugation I've listed as b)

  

but a different conjugation generator from the University of Koln

<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csl-inflect/web/index.php>  

gives the conjugation I've listed as a).

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
