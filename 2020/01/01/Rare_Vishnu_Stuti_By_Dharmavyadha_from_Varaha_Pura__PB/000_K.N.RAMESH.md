Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. At the outset, may I wish you and your family a very happy and prosperous New Year 2020! May Lord bestow the best of best in every thing you aspire for.

  

As **Vaikunta Ekadashi** falls on **06-Jan-2020 (Monday)**, I am delighted to share a very rare, short and sweet hymn on **Lord Vishnu** by **Dharmavyadha** taken from **Varaha Puranam and Chapter 8 (titled Dharmavyadha Charitam)**. In the brief **Phalashruti**, it is mentioned that one who recites this hymn with devotion to **Lord Vishnu** attains the abode of **Lord Vishnu** and lives there for **70 manvantaras** (1 Manvantara = 71 Chaturyugas and 70 manvataras = 5 Kalpas).

  

Attention should be given to the 6th Stanza - "*In each Yuga, Vishnu creates Brahma from whom arose this world consisting of animates and inanimates and in whom, in the form of Rudra, all this is dissolved; so he is called Hari and Hara*". It is very easy for ordinary dull-witted people to get carried away with forms who choose to ignore substance at their own peril.

  

May We Pray To **Lord Narayana** with this beautiful prayer!

  

With best regards and pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
