SIGHT – Spiritual Information and Guide Tool

  

Namaste

  

Happy New Year !

  

Mr.Jyothindran, his brother, a few of my well-wishers and I have been working on development of aunique framework, data warehouse and a unique cross-reference platform query engine (single gateway) to access all the scriptures and related works of major religions oftheworld, in multiple languages possible.

  

On the new year day, we have achieved a mile-stone.The first version is ready for public access.

  

Please remember that it is now a collection of small rivers meeting a small ocean only. But, with HIS GRACE, we are sure that it will eventually become a great ocean of scriptural information, like the way, Wikipedia has been growing all these years. We need contributions in the form of information fromyouall.

  

So, please review this application objectively. We certainly will appreciate all your comments and constructive criticisms. In themeantime,we request you to contribute more information to make the data-warehouselarger and largerand enhance the interface and user-friendliness of the application.

  

For the coming few months, every week, we plan to release new set of additional data. We have already been flooded with lot of requests from various well-wishers. U are welcome to flood us with more info.  
  
If u are new to this application, please read the‘About Page’completely and play the short 3 min videoas usual in similar cases.

  

The front screen is self explanatory:

  

U can search for the information u want by providing***the full or part of the correct search string*** in following ways thru:

  

·Search Wizard,

  

·Scripture name, or Scripture verse

  

·Commentary/Translation (here u may search the complete library as of any time available, or by author, publication, transcribed by etc).

  

Finally, for now, the advantage of this tool is that u will know if the information u are looking for is available or not with few key strokes unlike the generic query engines of google / yahoo etc.

  

Here is the link:

Note: Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any clarifications or help in operating the system.

  

Regards

  

Mohan
