Dear list members,

  

Can anyone explain why a hymn of praise to the goddess would have the title argalāstotram . Monier-Williams dictionary gives as meanings of argala :1. "a wooden bolt for fastening a door" 2. A bar or check or impediment. 3: a wave.

  

Is argalā just the feminine of argala with the above meanings or something else and what is the relevence would be as a title to a hymn of praise to the goddess?

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
