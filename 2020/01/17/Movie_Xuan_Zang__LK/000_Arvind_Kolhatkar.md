Dear Group,



A movie produced in the Peoples Republic of China, with the title 'Xuan Zang' is available on YouTube at<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulDzLjz0wdw>. The movie shows the life of the famous 7th century Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled from Chang'an (now called Xian) through the Central Asian deserts and snowy mountains to India, in search of authentic Buddhist texts.



In his journey of 16 years out of China, he visited several places in Central Asia, NW of India and major cities in India such as Mathura, Kannauj, Kamarupa, Madurai, Nasik etc. He visited most of the sites associated with the life of Buddha, including his birthplace of Lumbini. He spent 4 years at Nalanda, studying under great teachers there. He was invited by Emperor Harsha to take part in an assembly of Buddhist scholars.



After his time in India he returned to Chang'an and spent his remaining life in translating works he had carried back from India. The Tang emperor built a monastery for his stay in Chang'an, which exists till date in Xian as the Great Wild Goose Pagoda.



The movie is in Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles and has a few dialogs in Sanskrit and Hindi. The scenery, especially in the Central Asian Deserts, is spectacular. The Indian scenes give us an idea of what India of those times looked like. Buddhist sites like Ajanta, Ellora, Nalanda etc. are also shown.



A written invitation from Emperor Harsha is shown at one place. In all probability the script in use at that time would have been Brahmi but the invitation uses the Modi Script, in use in Maharashtra and adjoining Kannada and Telugu area, as a cursive script.
