Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Makara Sankranti** (**Pongal** in Tamil) falls on **15-Jan-2020** (Wed), I am glad to share a rare hymn titled **Aditya Stavam** by **Lord Brahma** taken from **Markandeya Puranam** and **Chapter 100**.

  

In **Markandeya Purana**, chapters 99-107 explain the majesty of **Lord Sun** and the genealogies and contain several hymns on **Lord Aditya** by different personas. The attached one is by **Lord Brahma** who prays to **Lord Aditya** to start creation by contracting the glory of **Lord** **Sun**. It is given that **Lord Brahma** contracted the supreme glory of **Lord Sun** and complete the creation of the universe (Gods/Devas, Asuras, beings, mortals, cattle, animals, trees, shrubs, hells, etc.). The **Dhyana shloka** at the start is actually the last stanza from previous chapter (Chapter 99).

  

Though **Makar Sankranti** is 10 days away, I am glad to squeeze time for this now as the professional grind after the year-end lull has just about started and it is often difficult to find personal space after that. So, May I wish you, your family, kith and kin a very **Happy Pongal and Makar Sankranti in advance!**

  

May We Pray to **Lord Aditya** with this exquisite prayer!May the resplendent **Lord Surya** shower you with His Blessings to achieve abundance in every dimension in the same way as He blessed **Lord Brahma** to accomplish creation!

  

With best regards/pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
