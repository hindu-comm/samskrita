Dear Harry-ji,

  

To be able to understand how विलपनम् suits here, as it is , we should consider the following points:

  

1\. Bhaktas indeed cry as part of their Bhakti. This can be from the degree of just tears rolling down the cheeks to intense and loud crying. This is interpreted by the expressing person, sometimes as just an expression, involuntary, of the ecstasy of Bhakti, sometimes as actual pain-expressing crying. Pain-expressing crying is interpreted as the expression of longing for anugraha and /or dars'ana. Verbal expressions of the longing for anugraha and /or dars'ana using wailing words are found in innumerable Bhakti lyrics throughout the length and breadth of India.

  

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was noted for his 'weeping' /tears rolling expressions during his dancing to the tunes of Bhakti lyrics.

  

2\. Bhagavadgita lists aartah as one of those who approach paramaatman.

  

3\. There is a proverb " Crying babies are cared more" . The poet here is saying , " I can not draw your attention by crying like the other Bhaktas who are crying are doing"
