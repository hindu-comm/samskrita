Thank you everyone,

  

What I'm not clear about is whether the verse means something like:

a\)

Alas I know no mantra, no yantra, no hymn, nor how to invoke you, no meditation nor words of praise, no great lamentation \[as worship of you\]. But this I know, O Mother, whoever follows you has their distress removed.

or

b\)

Alas I know no mantra, no yantra, no hymn, nor how to invoke you,, no meditation nor words of praise. ButI do not lament greatly because I know that whoever follows you has their distress removed.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
