The title of the thread mentions "विलपनं परं"  
However the two words are not to be taken to be in one and the same clause/sentence.  
"न जाने विलपनम्" is one clause/sentence.  
"परं जाने...." is another clause/sentence.  
भक्तिः devotion can be rendered in nine different ways. विलपनम् is one of the nine ways.

The nine ways of devotion are mentioned in a श्लोकः in भागवतम्. There it is mentioned as आत्मनिवेदनम् instead of विलपनम्.  
One can say, that significance of प्रथमोऽध्यायः of गीता is because अर्जुनविषादयोगः is actually आत्मनिवेदनम् / विलपनम्.  
Etymology of विलपनम् is from विलप् where meaning of लप् is लपँ व्यक्तायां वाचि.

So a person doing विलपनम् can be verbose, as अर्जुन is in प्रथमोऽध्यायः
