Namaskaram,

  

In the sentence "रसायनं रोगान् हरति", I saw a translation "the medicine removes the diseases".

  

My question is, sinceरसायनम् is composed byरस and अयन, meaning "fluids" and "path" respectively, which kind of samasa is this?

  

I think it can be a tatpurusha 6, like "path of the fluids", but I not sure, it looks like it is a anya-pada-pradhana (bahuvrhi), because the medicine is not the "path" it self...

  

Thank you!

  

Om
