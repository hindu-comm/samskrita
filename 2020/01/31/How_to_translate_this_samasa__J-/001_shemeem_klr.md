The word "Rasayana" is composed of 2 terms.  
  
Rasa (रस।) - Rasa is one of the 7 dhatus. It refers to a body tissue/fluid which is believed to be the essence of nutrition  
Ayana(अयन।) - The pathway towards all body tissue elements (to nourish and replenish them) that provide Rasa dhatu access to other dhatus.  
Thus, Rasayana means the therapy that is targeted at nutrition of all the body tissues.
