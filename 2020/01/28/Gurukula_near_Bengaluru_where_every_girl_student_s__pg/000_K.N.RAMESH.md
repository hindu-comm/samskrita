\*Gurukula near Bengaluru where every girl student speaks fluent Sanskrit\*

  

\*Shubham Karoti Maitreyi Gurukula\* is a charitable residential school for about 80 girls, spread across 12 acres of land, that houses even a \*Gaushala\*. It aims to restore our \*Bharatiya\* culture and ethos - \*Swastha Susamskruta Samajada Nirmana\* as the founders call it. The name \*Shubham Karoti\* itself means \*Do Good Deeds\* in \*Sanskrit\*.

  

The girls hail from remote parts of Karnataka and they speak fluent \*Sanskrit\*, which is the conversational language inside the \*Gurukula\* premises. it is indeed rare to find such a place in \*Bharat\*, where a community of about 100 people speak only in \*Sanskrit\*. The medium of instruction is \*Kannada\* and it follows \*open schooling system\*.

  

The girls studying in class 5th to 10th start their day at 5am and in addition to academics they are also taught numerous activities to develop their all-around personality like memory and cognitive skills, Computer skills, experiential Science, Vedic Maths/Abacus, Yoga, Bharatanatyam, Yakshagana, Music, Tailoring, Horticulture, Cooking, Vedic studies, ancient Bharatiya games, parade band, Karate and drama/skit/anchoring/public speaking etc.

  

The \*Gurukula\* was inaugurated on the auspicious occasion of \*Vyasa Poornima\* on 22nd July 1994, by \*Poojya Swamiji Sri Sri Sri Vishveshwara Teerta - Pejawar Math, Udupi\* and the Founder \*Sri Ramdas Kamat\*. It is located in \*Ramohalli (near Big Banyan Tree), about 25 kms from Bengaluru\*.

  

\*Shubham Karoti Maitreyi Gurukula\* is a one of a kind unique school, that should spearhead the ancient \*Gurukula\* way of learning in \*Bharat\*. üôèüôè
