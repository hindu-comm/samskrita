धराधरेन्द्रनंदिनीविलासबन्धुबन्धुर  
स्फुरद्दिगन्तसन्ततिप्रमोदमानमानसे ।

कृपाकटाक्षधोरणीनिरुद्धदुर्धरापदि  
क्वचिद्दिगम्बरे मनो विनोदमेतु वस्तुनि ॥३॥   

  

The first two lines look like a single bahuvrīhi compound, inside which there are other compounds. But I don't understand the meaning of the red part.  

**dharādharendra****nandinī** =pārvatī

**vilāsa** = līlā;

**bandhu** = partner

**bandhura** = beautiful

sphurat = ...

diganta = ..

santati = ...

**pramodamāna** = rejoicing ;

**mānase** = in the one whose mind

  

Thanks in advance for the help.  

p.s.

Vamsi Sudha ji,The page you have indicated does not seem clear to me about these three words.
