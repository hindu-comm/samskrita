This may have come in the group but I would be thankful if you can tell me who wrote the corona Raksha Kavacham that is circulated around on Whatsapp saying it is from Shivapuranam, There is also audio version that you may have heard. I saw on Youtube some acknowledgements like Rajenda Prasad Misra and Ravikanthacharya. My meagre Hindi didn't give me a clear understanding.

Thank you

Gomathy
