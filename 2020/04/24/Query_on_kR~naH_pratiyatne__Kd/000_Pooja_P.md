Namaste,

  

In the shuudrakavarNanam of kAdambarI, we see him explaining यश्च मनसि धर्मेण, कोपे यमेन … प्रकटितविश्वरूपाकृतेरनुकरोति भगवतो नारायणस्य। I referred to siddhanta kaumudi and understood the meaning of the suutra and it's relevance in bANA's sentence. But when I refer to bAlamanorama here -<http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/2/3/53>The example given isएधोदकस्योपस्करणमिति.My question is how does this mean "he prepares the wood and water for sacrifice? " What is the new quality in this sentence to the meaning of upakaraNam?

  

My question is a tad convoluted I agree, but any pointers would be appreciated. I referred to SCVasu's translation of Kaumudi.

  

With Regards,

Pooja
