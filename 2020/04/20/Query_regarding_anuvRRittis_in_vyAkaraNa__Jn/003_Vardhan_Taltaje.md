You can try the 3 volume Ashtadhyayi-Bhashya-PrathamaVritti by Brahma Datta Jijnasu, published by Ram Lal Lapur trust. You can search for the words 'Ashtadhyayi Bhashya Prathmavritti' in [archive.org](http://archive.org) to view a scanned version of the book.  
  
The on-line <http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani> too gives the anuvrittis and it is very convenient to navigate.

  

Best Regards
