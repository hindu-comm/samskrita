Namaste,

  

I am looking at Siddhanta Kaumudi, where the anuvRRittis are not given for the sutras.

  

Which book should I refer to know the anuvRRittis of a particular suutra (for example till which sutra does it propagate or if there is the pluti, how many sutras are skipped etc)

  

Any pointers will be appreciated.

  

With Regards,

Pooja
