Dear Sumedha,

  

These are prerecorded dramas from 2018-19. They were uploaded to YouTube with restricted access.

  

  
Two times in a day (3 hours each), they are removing the access restriction. During those public access window times, anyone can watch those dramas. They are not live streams. That means, one can watch them, skip/forward/go back/play again/... do all these things - but within those 3-hour duration only. After that period, 'public' access will be removed they will again become 'private' videos.

  

So far, I could watch only Sakuntalam drama. Waiting for the others to be opened one by one in the coming days.

  

Regards

P V S Kumar
