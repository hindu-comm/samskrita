Kalakshetra is providing a visual and music feast to the lovers of Classical bharatanatyam dance. What is unique to this institution is that they have managed to maintain a very high level of standard in terms of the music, dance, costume etc., as laid down by its founder Smt. Rukmini Devi Arundale.
