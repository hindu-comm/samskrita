Dear All,  

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Sri Rama Navami** falls on Thursday (02-Apr-2020), I am delighted to share a very rare **Dhyanam** on **Lord Sri Rama** taken from **Padma Puranam, Patala Khanda, Chapter 36**. Though the **Dhyana** is not very long, the prologue consisting of the greatness of Lord Rama, qualifications required to chant this hymn and the benefits accrued by chanting this hymn are given, etc is much longer.. A brief description is given as usual.

  

Perhaps first time in history, **Sri Rama Navami** needs to be celebrated without the usual fanfare as most of the world is in lock down due to Corona virus. As the hymn mentions, there is nothing beyond **Lord Rama** and there is no mantra beyond **Lord Rama**.  

  

May We All Pray Fervently To **Lord Rama** with this exquisite **Dhyanam** and beseech His mercy to save this world from this pandemic and recalibrate **Sanatana Dharma** towards its glory!

  

With best regards and Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
