There are two questions:

  

1: is is proper to link two nouns in duel form simply by appending one to the other and setting the suffix in duel form as follows?

  

2: In a sutra format, the exposition would like to go into topics related to a table form like so

  

  

Options for columns: Known \| Unknown

  

Options for rows: Home of Map \| Map of Home  

  

Total options: known home of map, known map of home, unknown home of map, known map of home.

  

To put this simply, does the following grammar work to prepare for exposition?

  

ज्ञानाज्ञने सदनस्यमनाचत्रमनास्यसदने।

Many thanks!

  

The wish and practice of non-violence accepts its paradoxical roots and ends with the humble prayer for a world:

  

अहिंसा
