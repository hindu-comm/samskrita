Here is a novel E-learning course meant to teach High-schoolers, the Nyaaya-vaisheshika way of reasoning about the world. My daughter has attended it, and is totally glued and having lots of fun.  

  

Taught by an innovative young Nyaaya scholar, Sri J. Suryanarayana who passed the famed Tenali pariksha, this first part of a 3-part 1-year-long course series serves as a bridge for mainstream high school children to get into serious study of Indic shaastras and imbibe model-based scientific reasoning.

  

The second and third parts are in Sanskrit medium, and give a thorough exposure to India's foundational sciences of Nyaaya-vaisheshika and Sankhya.

  

**Start Date**: Nov 18, 2020

**Duration**: 2 months (8 weeks) + assignments & final exam.  

**Medium**: English

**Fee**: Rs. 4000/-

**Eligibility**: 8th to 12th std students
