The Indian mathematician Mahāvīra (9th century CE) gave the formula for nCr, the number of ways to select ‘r’ entities out of ‘n’. The formula was known to Indian mathematicians much before. In the Bṛhatsaṃhitā (6th century CE), verse 76.20, Varāhamihira states the following, in an āryā metre, while discussing how to make perfumes—

षोडशके द्रव्यगणे चतुर्विकल्पेन भिद्यमानानाम्।  
अष्टादश जायन्ते शतानि सहितानि विंशत्या॥  
ṣoḍaśake dravyagaṇe caturvikalpena bhidyamānānām  
aṣṭādaśa jāyante śatāni sahitāni viṃśatyā

Translation by V. Subramanya Sastri—“Out of a collection of sixteen kinds of substances, the number of perfumes that can be made by selecting any four will be 1820.”

My translation—“When there is a collection of sixteen entities, on being distinguished by options (=selections) of four, there arise eighteen hundreds along with twenty (18 × 100 + 20 = 1,820).”

What Varāhamihira says that 16C4 = 1,820, which is correct as 16C4 = (16 × 15 × 14 × 13) / (1 × 2 × 3 × 4) = 1,820. Surely Varāhamihira knew the formula for nCr.
