I attach herewith the English translation of the chapter on Combinatorics from the Līlāvatī of Bhāskarācārya.

  

The translation is by my father late Prof. A B Padmanābha Rao.

  

He has rearranged the words in the 'sloka and provided the English translation of each word / phrase, so that reading English translation of the words, you get the meaning.

  

Best,

Amba Kulkarni
