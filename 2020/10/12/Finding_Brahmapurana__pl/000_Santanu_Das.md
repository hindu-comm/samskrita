Hello dear members,

I've come to know that besides Gaṇeśa Purāṇa and Mudgala Purāṇa, Brahma Purāṇa also speaks a lot about Gaṇeśa and it is dear to the Gāṇapatya Sampradāya. In the commentary of Mahāgaṇapati Sahasranāma, I have seen a lot of reference slokas from this Brahma Purāṇa where Gaṇeśa is viewed as Parabrahma. I've also attached the screenshot of a page. Can anyone please suggest where can I get the full version of that particular Brahma Purāṇa?

Hope I'll be helped.
