Dr. Bhat was another great teacher( like the late Sunder Hattangadi) in this forum from whom I silently and almost anonymously leant a lot

\- mostly from his group postings and at least on one occasion from his
private and detailed response to a query of mine.

  

I will miss seeing his name in future communication in this forum, only thru which I 'knew' him.
