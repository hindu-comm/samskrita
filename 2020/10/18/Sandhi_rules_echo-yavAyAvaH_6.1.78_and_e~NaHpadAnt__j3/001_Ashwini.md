Respected Ram,

Namaste.

  

a\) 6.1.109 is an exception to 6.1.78 which applies only when the following vowel is अकारः ।

b\) 6.1.109 is an external sandhi and applies only for एच् (ए , ऐ , ओ , औ) at end of a WORD, followed by अ ।

Your examples 1) ने + अ = नय् + अ = नय

2\) भो + अ = भव् + अ = भव

3\) ध्यै + अ = ध्याय् + अ = ध्याय

are all INTERNAL sandhi, and so 6.1.109 is not applicable.

c\) So we can say that 6.1.109 is applicable for a small subset of the situations encountered.

  

Jai Gurudev
