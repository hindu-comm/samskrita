Namaste Gomathy Ji

  

These are not due to errors in the sample PDF or the book but due to erroneous display of some Devanagari glyphs on [academia.edu](http://academia.edu) website.

  

Just download and read the sample PDF (attached in my post) in any PDF viewer and you will not see any of the errors that you highlighted below. I have attached two images showing how the same words are rendered correctly by a Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat plugin.

  

The book does not have these errors.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
