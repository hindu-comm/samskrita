I am pleased to announce that my book “Sunāma: Beautiful Sanskrit Names” is out. Some photos of the book are attached with this email.

  

The book is available for pre-order on Amazon India and Flipkart.  

Amazon India link:<https://www.amazon.in/dp/9390358108>  

Flipkart link:<https://www.flipkart.com/sunama/p/itm905bf954fba18>

  

In a few weeks, it will be available in bookstores in India and also on Amazon.com internationally. The e-book and Kindle versions are expected to be out in a couple of months.

  

For now, if copies are required outside India, please email me off the list. For bulk copies also, please email me off the list.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
