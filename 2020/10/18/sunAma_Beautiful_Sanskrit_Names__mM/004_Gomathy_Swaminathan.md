Dear Misra Mahodaya,

I have watched some of your lectures on Sanskrit names with great interest. Your effort is much appreciated. It is a much needed book when people rake the internet for nice sounding Sanskrit names. Congratulations on this great effort.

I was going through the few pages that were visible on the link. I have already identified some typographical errors. The computer transliterations are not faultfree and some errors have crept in and escaped proof reading, it appears.

In the few pages I was able to scan, here are the typos I wanted to bring your attention to. Some I have listed alongside the right words but others I am not able to reproduce with the transliteration.

  

वसिष्ठो विसष्ठो  
अखिन्न अखिन्ना  
अग्निमित्र  
हविष्णु हिवष्णु  
हविष्मान् हिवष्मान्  
हविष्मती  हिवष्मती  
होत्रिका होत्रीय होत्रीया  

  

Maybe you are already aware of these. If so. please excuse and ignore my email

  

Thank you,

  

Gomathy
