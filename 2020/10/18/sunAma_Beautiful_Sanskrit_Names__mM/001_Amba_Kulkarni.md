Congratulations Nityananda ji for an excellent book.

  

Parents keep asking us about Good Names for their newborns, and I used to have a lot of difficulty in suggesting the names since the resources on Internet are not that good and full of errors as you have rightly mentioned in your preface. Referring to the dictionary used to be very time-consuming.

  

Now I'll always recommend your book to such parents.

  

Best,

Amba Kulkarni
