***About the book***  

Parents wish to give a unique and meaningful name to their child. In India, a Sanskrit name is mostly preferred. Often parents turn to the Internet, which is replete with misinformation on Sanskrit names. Popular name websites mispresent meaning of many Sanskrit words and sometimes even list names from other languages, presenting them as Sanskrit names. Some bestselling books on Sanskrit names also carry such mistakes. Parents are misled by such sources and end up giving a *kunāma* (‘a bad name’) to their child.

  
Each Sanskrit *sunāma*—or ‘a good name’—has a mathematical derivation (*vyutpatti*) and/or a mystical explanation (*nirukti*). This work by Nityānanda Miśra is a wonderful collection of more than 3,000 *sunāma*s, most of which are rare or unused today. He studied more than 70,000 names in seventy-seven authentic Sanskrit texts, including seven Vedic *saṃhitās*, ten *Purāṇas*, the *Rāmāyaṇa*, the *Mahābhārata*, seven *koṣa*s, three grammar works and thirty-eight *sahasranāma*s for this compilation. Each name entry includes the Devanagari and IAST spellings, gender, meaning, and the person or deity to whom the name belongs. Opposite gender versions of the names are also provided, wherever applicable.  

  

A work of immense dedication and accurate research, this is a must-have for parents seeking rare or unique Sanskrit names for their child.
