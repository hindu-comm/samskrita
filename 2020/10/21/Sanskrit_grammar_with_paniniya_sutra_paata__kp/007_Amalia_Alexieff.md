If the grammar itself is not of the Krta Yuga, then the language is not Sanskrit: for example, Latin is not French. It's not a question of whether you are "superseding" Panini or not - it's a question of being "speakers" of a language that is not Sanskrit, even if there are historical grammatical connections to the language you now speak.

  

Why would anyone want to debase the true Sanskrit texts with silly things like newspaper and magazine articles - not to mention a coffee commercial?  

  

Think about it...
