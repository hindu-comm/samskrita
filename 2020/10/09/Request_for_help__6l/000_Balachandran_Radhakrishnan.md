Yesterday was my dear father's 102nd birth anniversary (he passed away in the year 1988 aged 69 yrs) and I was remembering in particular the shlokas he used to recite, the parayana he used to do every morning.

  

There was one shloka which he used to keep on repeating endlessly during his bath and even afterwards until he is ready to settle down to start with the actual recitation that he had planned for that day.

  

Over the years, I have been searching for shloka's origin without success. Perhaps one of you - can help me. Though I cannot remember the shloka fully, it goes like this:

  

सीताम् वेदनयाम् रामस्य ............... भूमिदाम् चरणम् भजे

  

I may be quite wrong even about the exact words above. My guess is it is from Sundara Kandam.

  

Can anyone of you recollect the full shloka and its origin?

Thanks & regards. Balachandran R
