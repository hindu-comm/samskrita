Modern Hinduism as practised today, owes much to the Puranas which are an important genre of India’s religious texts, notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of cosmology, philosophy, and rituals.

  

Puranas usually give prominence to a particular deity, employing an abundance of religious and philosophical concepts. They are usually written in the form of stories related by one person to another. The Puranas were composed in Sanskrit and most have been excellently translated into modern Indian languages.

  

The Puranas may be seen as a reflection of the aims and aspirations, views and ideologies, rights and rituals, religious and secular perspectives of ancient Indians. At once, they teach, educate and entertain.

  

We are proud to present this beautiful set of Puranas, translated extremely skilfully into modern Hindi. These books are available at our bookstore and through mail order. We ship books all over the world and accept payment by IMPS, NEFT, Paytm, Visa and MasterCard.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
