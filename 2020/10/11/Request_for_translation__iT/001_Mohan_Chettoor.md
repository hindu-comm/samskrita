इत्युक्तस्तत्र सूतस्तु मुनिदत्ते शुभासने ।

समासीनो महाबुद्धिः साञ्जलिः सन्प्रतापवान् ॥

सुखासीनं च सूतं तं दृष्ट्वा तत्र महामुनिः ।

भृगुप्रेष्ठश्च मुख्योऽसौ मुनीनां प्रत्युवाच ह ॥

"Oh '*Sootha'*! '*Sootha'*! Great soul, who raises the level of virtue, kindly be seated. Certainly, we were happy at the very sight of yourself. Thus spoken to,the great illustrious intellect got seated with folded hands in the seat offered by the saint. On seeing that '*Sootha*' thus comfortably seated, the loving Brugu, the seer of saints, replied:"

  

Regards,

Mohan.
