Namaskara,

  

I foundthis beautiful shloka. In an article that I was reading.

![shloka.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/2c24a08009554/shloka.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)  

  

It very clearly explains how to pronounce ca.

I was wondering where I could find the entire compilation for all the aksharas.

  

I searched in yajnavalkya shiksha, paniniya shiksha, naradiya shiksha and Ashtadhyayi but could not find it.

  

I would be extremely gratefulif someone could help me out.

  

Thank you,

M Kameshwari Prasad Dev
