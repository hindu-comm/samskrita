Yes. It is for the same reason.

  

For visarga after a, before अ, it should be become o normal rule of sandhi. Because the visarga is for स् of सु in the final position which changes into रु according to the ruleससजुषो रुः and this ru becomes to उ before अ. शक्यस्+अहम् ➡️शक्यर्+अहम्➡️शक्य+उ+अहम्➡️ शक्यो+अहं➡️ due toअतो रोरप्लुतादप्लुते. and thenएङः पदान्तादति (६.१.१०९) makes pararupa शक्योऽहम्. This operation is ru to u has not been done in this case. That is said in the commention. Hence guna could not be done.

Instead it has been replaced to य् and then lost according to लोपः शाकल्यस्यल making into शक्य अहं which could not be made aa.
