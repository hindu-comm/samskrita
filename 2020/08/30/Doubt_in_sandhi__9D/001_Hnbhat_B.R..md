न वेदयज्ञाध्ययनैर्न दानै  
  
र्न च क्रियाभिर्न तपोभिरुग्रैः।  
  
*एवंरूपः शक्य अहं* नृलोके  
  
द्रष्टुं त्वदन्येन कुरुप्रवीर।।11.48।।

  

एवंरूपः+ शक्य अहं

  

1.एवंरूपः+ शक्यः ➡️एवंरूपः शक्यः/एवंरूप**श्श**क्यः✅

2.शक्यः+अहं ➡️**शक्योऽहं । ✅**

The sandhi in 1 can be in both ways as shown above and both are correct. In the sandhi 2 is wrong in the verse and should have been as shown as above. This is noted in the commentary as below as a special case

रोरुत्वाभाव आर्षः. Hence it cannot be further joined making further confusion.
