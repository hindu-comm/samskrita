You can be right. Actually yad is ending in d as alone as pronoun and mad is in pancami the pronoun yushmad ending in d becomes mad. Then becomes optionally t/d which again becomes t/d accordingly in sandhi according to the following letter. Like  yat phalam or yad vanam or yadartham/yatkRpA in compound. That is, it becomes t/d in sandhi according to the following letter.

  

But it is compulsory to have a sandhi in compound and cannot be having without sandhi as per the maxim regarding sandhi formation.संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः । नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥

  

Hence it happens in a compound, sandhi should take place according to rules of sandhiझलां जश् झषि which replaced by d itself by the operation of the rule.

  

This is a fact. You can take it as you like it. A similar discussion was raised whether there is sandhi in respect of परमात्मा which went away as one likes. I am reminded of it by your question.
