Namaste,

  

Recently one of my friends asked me to translate the following sentence into Sanskrit:

  

**I am one with him, who made me.**

  

I suggested the following:

  

**यो मामसृजत् तेन सह मम एकीभावः .**

  

Any suggestions for the improvements are greatly appreciated.

  

Thanks and Regards
