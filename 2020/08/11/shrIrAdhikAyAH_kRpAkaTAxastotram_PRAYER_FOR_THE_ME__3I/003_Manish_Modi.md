Dear Valerio,  
Pranam  
  
Please call me Manish.  
  
I am not a PhD, only a BCom and LLB.  
  
I think both your corrections are quite valid. I shall make them. Thank you for pointing them out.  
  
I do not have a proper mula patha. I was forwarded something by a friend's uncle who wanted me to translate it. I made some corrections to it and translated it. Evidently, my knowledge of Sanskrit is very, very elementary.  
  
Manish
