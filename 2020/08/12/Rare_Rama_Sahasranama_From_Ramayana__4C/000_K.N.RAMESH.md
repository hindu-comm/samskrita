Dear All,

  

Greetings. After centuries of struggle and a century of litigation, the ground breaking ceremony of Sri Rama Temple is scheduled on Aug 05, 2020 Wednesday. In a way, the current generation is blessed to see a settlement to this in their lifetime which the previous generations were not lucky enough.

  

In this connection, I am delighted to share a very rare and unique Sahasranama of Lord Rama. The original booklet from which I took this claims this is from Ramayana and is capable of bestowing whatever the is asked for. In the current context, our wish can't be anything other than a grand template at the birth place of Lord Rama which will direct current/future generations in Sanatana Dharma.

  

This Sahasranama actually contains about 250 Namas (names) and RamaRama is prefixed and suffixed to make it 1000, in my guess. It is quite possible that the words from Ramayana have been taken to compose this in the same way as Purushottama Sahasranama has been compiled from Srimad Bhagavatam by gleaning all Bhagavan Namas.

  

It is a historical moment in Hindu history and May Lord Rama bestow the world with eternal peace and free from all diseases at once! May We all pray for the grand and successful completion of Bhumi-puja as well as temple with this Sahasranama.

  

With best regards & Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
