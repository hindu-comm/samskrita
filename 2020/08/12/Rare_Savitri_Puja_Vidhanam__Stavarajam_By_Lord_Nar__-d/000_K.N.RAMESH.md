Dear All,  

  

Greetings and Namaste. As the saying goes, I would like to make hay while the sun shines! I have not been able to spend time on my personal interests in the last 4 months of Covid-19 Work From Home but I am happy to make up during this short breather time because such breather time is rare and far in between. Apologies if I am flooding your mailboxes but I hope they are useful!

  

As **Gayatri Japam** (the day after **Yajur Upakarma**) falls on **Tuesday (04-Aug-2020)**, I feel privileged to share a very rare **Savitri** **Puja Vidhanam** and **Savitri Stavarajam** by **Lord Narayana** as told to **King Ashvapati** and taken from **Brahma Vaivarta Puranam**, **Prakriti Khanda** and **Chapter 23**.  

  

**Lord Narayana** prescribes a 14-year long Vrat on **Goddess Savitri** which should be started on the bright 13th day of **Jyeshta** month to be done on the 14th day (**Chaturdashi**). Puja to Goddess Savitri to be performed as prescribed after installing holy pot (ghata) and worshipping Lord Ganesha/Surya/Agni/Vishnu/Shiva/Parvati. Lord Narayana also gives a different **Mantra** for Goddess Savitri which is as per **Madhyandina Shakha** (branch).  

  

**Lord Narayana mentions that one who prays to Goddess Savitri with the short Stavarajam at the end thrice a day begets the benefit of chanting the four vedas.**

  

May We Worship Goddess Savitri with this prayer on Gayatri Japa day!

  

With best regards & pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
