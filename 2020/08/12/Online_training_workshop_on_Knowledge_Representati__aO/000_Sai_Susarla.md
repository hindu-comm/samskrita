.  
This 5-week online training workshop by Prof. Suryanarayana J of MIT SVS opens a new avenue for innovation in a knowledge-driven world. It provides systematic training in the identification and use of Nyaaya shaastra’s categorized relations as a way to capture and navigate knowledge in general, and Indian shaastric knowledge in particular.  

It offers traditional scholars a fresh perspective to present shaastras. It is especially useful for professionals in IT and Jurisprudence who deal directly with knowledge processing and inference.

  

We are contemplating a new multi-institutional initiative to transform popular Indic shaastra texts into concept maps to be more intellligible to students and minable. This training course and its follow-up course prepares one to participate in that effort.
