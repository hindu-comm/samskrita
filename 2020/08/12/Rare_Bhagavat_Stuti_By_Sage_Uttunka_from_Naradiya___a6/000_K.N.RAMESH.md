Dear All,  

  

Greetings and Namaste. As Sri Krishna Jayanti/Gokulashtami falls on Tuesday, the 11th August 2020 (the date is different according to some traditions), I am delighted to share a very rare and exquisite hymn on Lord Vishnu by Sage Uttanka as retold by Sage Sanaka to Sage Narada - taken from Brihan Naradiya Mahapuranam, Purva Bhaga, Prathama Pada, Vishnu Mahatmya and Chapter 38.

  

This is a very sweet hymn and Lord Narayana assures that those who worship Him with this prayer will be bestowed with the fulfillment of all their rightful wishes as well as emancipation.

  

May We Pray To Lord Krishna with this beautiful prayer!

  

With best regards & Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
