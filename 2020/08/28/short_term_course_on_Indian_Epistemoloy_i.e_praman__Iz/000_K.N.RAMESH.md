Good morning to everyone. We have invited applications for a short term course on Indian Epistemoloy i.e pramana shastra. Candidates interested in knowing pramanas, but not able to spend two years or 3 years for that will be benefitted very much with this course. This is a short term course only for three months with two hrs class in a week. No external exam for this course. Only continious assesment will be done. All the content related to pramanas such as their definitions classifications and difference of opinion in different darshanas willl be taught in a lucid way with not stressing much on textual reading. Instead of that we will go by content. The main course instuctor will be me and i will be assisted by my Dept. staff. Anyone interested can log in to our website [www.ksu.ac.in](http://www.ksu.ac.in) and fill the online application form. This message can be forwarded to your friend's circle.
