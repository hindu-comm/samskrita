I request Dr. What to please explain :

1\. How kethu, a *persona non grata* among planets, can be supreme head of Grahas, especially when the group includes his arch enemies i. e. Surya and Chandra.

2\. Why the two wordsरौद्रं, रौद्रात्मकं which have almost similar meaning, repeated. Does the word roudra mean anything else other than 'fierce'?

  

Thanks and regards

Mohan
