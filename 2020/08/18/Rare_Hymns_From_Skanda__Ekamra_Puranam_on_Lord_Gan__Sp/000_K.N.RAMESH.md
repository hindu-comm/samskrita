Dear All,  

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Vinayaka Chaturthi** falls on **Saturday (22-Aug-2020)**, I am delighted to share a hymn on **Lord Ganesha** taken from **Skanda Purana, Mahesvara Khanda** and **Chapter 11** (titled **Ganesha Pujavidhi**). To this, I have appended another very short stuti (just 4-lines) on **Lord Ganesha** taken from **Ekamra Puranam** and **Chapter 55.**

  

This year, **Sri Ganesh Chaturthi** will be celebrated in a milieu where the entire world is manacled by the Covid-19 pandemic with no inkling of its retreat thus shoving the world economies into deep recession, depriving millions of their livelihood and making many impecunious.  

  

May We Pray To **Lord Vinayaka**, as the **Prathama Pujita** and the remover of all obstacles, begging Him to show mercy on this world and humanity to retrieve them from destitution!

  

With best regards and pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
