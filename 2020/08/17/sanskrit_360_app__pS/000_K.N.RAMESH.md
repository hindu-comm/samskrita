Namaste,

  

We are glad to announce the launch of our new Mobile Development Lab called \_\*AIEUN LABS™️\*\_ (अइउण् / அஇஉண்) with a goal of building Android and iOS mobile Apps related to Ancient Indian wisdom.

  

Today, we have Launched the first Mobile App (iOS and Android) in the series - \*"Sanskrit Dhatu 360°"\* which focuses on sanskrit verbal diction with many other related tools like tinganta and kridanta pratyaya for 2180 dhatus. Plus over 30,000 illustrations of verbs from our various sanskrit texts like ramayana , mahabharata, charakam, sushrutam, kumarasambhava, etc.

In short, this will be a one stop App for anything related to Dhatu-roopa (verbs).

  

We had to attach price to iOS Apps to compensate the cost involved in Apple development programme.

Hope you enjoy the experience!!
