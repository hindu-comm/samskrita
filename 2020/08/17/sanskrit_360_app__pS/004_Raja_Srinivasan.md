Dear Swamin

I have uploaded several Ebooks on to Apple iBooks store in samskritam. These are meant more for me than for anyone else, and since it is free thought I will share it with you. Anyone can download this. You can search for the books under my name — ‘Raja Srinivasan’. I currently have uploaded Sri Vishnu Sahasaranamam, Sri Lakshmi Ashtohara Sada Nama Stotram, Mantra Raja Pada Stotram, Sri Kamshi Stotram, Sri Bala Mukundham, Abhitistavah, Pandavagita, Sri Narasimhashtakam and a couple more. I used Mac Pages to transcribe them. If you care to use them in you efforts towards an ‘app’ and expand the ‘app’ please do not hesitate to use these. If you need my raw Mac-Pages documents please do ask and I am happy to share.

  

I recently started an effort (with my brother) to expand this to include several tamil works too. This is not going as fast as I want due to other commitments on my time.

  

My aim is to make these works available in ebook format. And in the future, to make it more readable, I want to add in the transliterated texts in english so my children can read them too.

  

I have no idea how to set them up as an ‘app’, but would love to do something with them.

  

Thanks & Regards

Raja Srinivasan
