Smt Puspa Dixit ji has developed a unique approach to learning Paniniiya Vyakaranam based on the thought processes underlying Astadhyayii. The result is a way to mastery of Panini's unique grammar; the path is easy and fun. It stands in distinct contrast to the traditional approach in Siddhanta Kaumudii which students find difficult and inefficient. Come join us and find out what this new, revolutionary approach to Paniniiya Vyakaranam is all about!  
  
NB The below two books are quite useful to have as reference during the course:
