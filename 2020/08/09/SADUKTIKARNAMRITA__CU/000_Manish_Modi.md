The cultivation of Sanskrit reached its peak in Bengal during the Sena rule (c. 1097 - 1225 CE). Serenely beautiful Sanskrit compositions emerged from Bengal in that era.

  

Sanskrit savant Shridhara Dasa selected the most beautiful Sanskrit verses composed by over 500 Sanskrit poets and created this masterly compilation.

  

He made it a point to mention the names of each poet whose verses he chose. These verses are beautifully translated into Hindi by Dr Radhavallabh Tripathi, a leading Sanskritist.
