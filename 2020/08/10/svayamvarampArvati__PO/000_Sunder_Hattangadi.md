One of the volunteer proof-readers while reading the text found some discrepancies as follows.

  

“I got the book from Giri Trading but it seems to have many errors in devanagari version.  
I was able to add info to the nyaasa section. However, I also found an old discussion at<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/q1MlZqGHs3Y>which has a different version.  
eg. the version we have says ब्रह्मा ऋषिः देवीगायत्री छन्दः, samskrita group post says -aja RiSiH, panktiH ChandaH svayamvara paarvatee devataa

  

to review the updated version at

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/svayamvarampArvati.html>

and let us know of corrections to be made.Thanks.”

  

It would be greatly appreciated if someone in the group could find any needed corrections.
