Dear Nagaraj,

  

I've found references on the internet attributing it to the Samba purana. I don't know if this is correct or not but in the mean timefollowing Sundar Hattangadi's hint searching under "upapuraṇa"I found the Samba Purana on [archive.org](http://archive.org) and I'll see if I can locate the hymn in this purana. So if anyone can give me information (chapter, verse) to help my search in the purana that would be great. Also Sundar provided a different possible source poet Mayurbhat, (in 7th cent. CE,) with some references.
