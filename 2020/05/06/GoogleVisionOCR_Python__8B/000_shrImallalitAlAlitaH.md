To Coders:  

Please, feel free to fork it.

  

To all:  

I know that people who don't fear terminal, etc. will easily get it working and develop on it.  

I'll like to request proficient ones to create a docker for non-programmer people, mostly elderly scholars who may not know how to install Python, packages, etc.

  

This python script can either take an image or a folder of images and convert image(s) to txt using Google Cloud Vision API. You may expect accuracy of about 98% if the scan is good enough.

This script will move images to a subfolder and txt files to another for ease of use of files.

  

It may help people who are working on reprints of old printed works by taking away the burden of typing the whole book.

  

Copy Paste from Read me:
