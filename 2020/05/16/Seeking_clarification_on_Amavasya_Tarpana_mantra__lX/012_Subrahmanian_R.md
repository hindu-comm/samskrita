Sir Nagaraj Paturi: Thank you very much for the pains you have given for my doubt.

1\. Your clarification: Please take स्वधा, नमः and पितॄन् तर्पयामि as two different parts is clear to me

2\. Authorities like Mahindra are guiding us by saying that the word स्वधा is the appropriate word to be used during offerings to pitr devatas. (Expressions स्वाहा , स्वधा etc. are independent expressions of वैदिक activities. They have been viewed as independent devatas. ) - Clear to me.

3\. स्वधा वै पितॄणामन्नम् in his bhashya, So पितॄन् स्वधा नमः has the connotation I offer this अन्नम् to my पितॄन् " - I surrender. I do not get your point. पितॄणाम् - षष्ठी बहुवचनम्; पितॄन् द्वितीया बहुवचनम् - I offer this अन्नम् to my पितर: or पितॄन्

How can द्वितिया be used for स्वधा or नम: in पितॄन् स्वधा नमः

Bhatt Mahodaya:

Your clarifications are clear to me. My utmost thanks to you.
