Sri Prakash Raj Pandey-ji has already clarified saying,

  

"Mahidhara gives this quotationस्वधावैपितॄणामन्नम् in his bhashya,Soपितॄन् स्वधा नमः has the connotation I offer this अन्नम् to myपितॄन्"

  

Let me try.

  

 Please take स्वधा, नमःand पितॄन् तर्पयामि as two different parts. Authorities like Mahindra are guiding us by saying that the word स्वधा is the appropriate word to be used during offerings to pitr devatas. (Expressions स्वाहा , स्वधा etc. are independent expressions of वैदिक activities. They have been viewed as independent devatas. )
