Sir, Thank you for the clarifications you had given me. But the attachments are mainly about the fourth case for nama; and similar salutations take fourth case. But my doubt about पितॄन् स्वधा नमस्तर्पयामि appears to have not been clarified. Why swadhaa nama: comes between pitruns tarpayami.

With respects  
R Subrahmanian
