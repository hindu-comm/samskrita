Respected scholars,

  

I humbly request the following help

  

1\. Where to get complete rules for creating a desiderative form. (I have referred to grammar books, but could not really get a detailed exposition)

  

2\. Is there a compendium of desiderative nouns/adjectives (If I may say so)

  

3\. I was looking for the desiderative for अर्प

  

Kindly excuse if my query is too elementary.

  

Thanking you, respected scholars,

  

Satyajita
