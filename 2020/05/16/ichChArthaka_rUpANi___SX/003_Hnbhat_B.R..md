It is not elementary, but needs deep knowledge of grammar. Since it is not a simple verb in found in 10 groups, you cannot find the forms in any list of verbs. Itself is a derived verb ऋ in Causative form अर्पयति. The dessiderative form is to be formed separately. A sample form of derivation of the dessiderative from the requested verb अर्पि is given below in brief:

  

अर्पि+सन्> 'सन्यङोः' अजादेर्द्वतीयस्य द्वित्वे अर्पिपि+स।सन इट् षत्वं च। अर्पिपि+इष।

अङ्गस्य गुणायादेशौ।अर्पिपय्+इष>अर्पिपयिष।

लट्। तिप्।अर्पिपयिष+ति।

कर्तरि शप्।अर्पिपयिष+अ+ति।

अतो गुणे पररूपम्। \> अर्पिपयिषति।

  

Now this can be continued like any other verb in the first group:

  

अर्पिपयिषति -अर्पिपयिषतः -अर्पिपयिषन्ति।  

अर्पिपयिषसि -अर्पिपयिषथः -अर्पिपयिषथ।  

अर्पिपयिषामि -अर्पिपयिषावः -अर्पिपयिषाम।

  

अर्पिपयिषांचकार and so on.  

  

Hope you willbunderstand the rest since you had already gone through the grammar books.

  

Thanking you
