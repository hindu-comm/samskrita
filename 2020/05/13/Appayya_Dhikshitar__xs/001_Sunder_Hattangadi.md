The full exhaustive list of 104 works attributed to Sri Appayya Dikshita is given above. As per this, he has written 25 works on*Vedantic*topics, 26 works on*Sivadvaita*themes, 7 volumes on*mimamsa*, one each on*Kavya Vyakhyana*, and*Vyakarana vyakhyana*, 3 on Alamkaras, 26 works of a devotional nature and 15 works of a miscellaneous character thus totaling 104. It is only further research and careful comparison of various manuscripts and proper editing of them, that can finally establish the authenticity of the authorship of all the manuscripts of works by Sri Appayya Dikshita. But that he wrote these works on these variety of themes seems beyond doubt.
