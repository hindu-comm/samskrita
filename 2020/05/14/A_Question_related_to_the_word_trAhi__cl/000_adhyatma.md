A Question related to the word त्राहि. It is a very commonly used word, but I could not find it's root (धातु). Can you please tell me what is the धातु here? I first thought that this is a word similar to पाहि, but I couldn't find any धातु named त्रा. The closest, I found is

त्रैङ् पालने भ्वादिः, आत्मनेपदी, सकर्मकः, अनिट्

But this being a धातु from भ्वादि and आत्मनेपदी, has the forms त्रायते etc. And लोट् लकार मध्यम पुरुष एकवचन is त्रायस्व
