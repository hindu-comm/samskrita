Dear Ambaji,

  

Pranam.

  

Thank you so much for your quick response. I found this resource really useful.

Your knowledge and commitment to help others by making available your website and resources therein, is very inspiring indeed. I find them very useful in my Sanskrit study. I however have a little problem in accessing your website Corpus resources. For example if I access the link<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/Corpus/>and click on Raw-Text for any of the links, I get gibberish. I tried in both Chrome and IE browsers, and same thing. Attaching a screen shot of clicking the link<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/Corpus/SHMT/Sandhi-Split/UOHYD/sankshep_ramayan_sandhi.txt> and I get the the screen, as attached.

  

Thanks and Regards

Adhyatma
