Hi All,

  
I am looking for the following tools for Sanskrit. If any of you can help me, that would be great.

1\. complete Sanskrit dhatu list, their meaning (English and Sanskrit) and other details (class, AtmanepadI/parasmaipadI, sakarmaka/ akarmaka etc)

2\. A tool to allow me to type Devanagari and IAST in any windows application

3\. An excel function or VBA script to convert from IRANS to Devanagari to IAST (interchangeably among these 3 scripts).

4\. Ganapatha with the meaning and usage

  

Thanks and Regards

Adhyatma
