I have a question on the wordकिम्. Is it an indeclinable or a pronoun? Dictionary mentions it as both indeclinable and pronoun.Reading the definition from Apte, it is not very clear when to use it as an indeclinable and when is it a pronoun. If somebody can clarify, that would be helpful.

  

In Gita (1.1), is it considered as a pronoun? If so, is it Neuter second case singular for the object of verb form अकुर्वत?

  

There are two words in gaNapATha:माकिम्। and नकिम्। Is there any connection of these words toकिम्?
