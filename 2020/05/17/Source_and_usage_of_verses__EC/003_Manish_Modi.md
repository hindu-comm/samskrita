With Sunder ji,  
Namaskar  
  
I read your reply to Harry Spier with interest.  
  
I am sorry but I disagree with your statement that that particular verse is reflected in the Jain Dipavali Puja. As a practising Jain, I am fairly certain that that particular phrase is not used by Jains during their Dipavali puja.  
  
I then went through the link you very kindly provided:

  
  
कर्पूरपूरेण मनोहरेण सुवर्णपात्रोदरसंस्थितेन ।  

प्रदिप्तभासा सह संगतेन नीरांजन तेजगदम्बाकुर्वे ॥  
  
The phrase is different because it is a stuti of Jagadamba (an all-inclusive umbrella term for the Jain adhishthayika devis, who are considered to be demi-goddesses whose main purpose is to serve the Tirthankaras). It is not a stuti of Jagadisha (Lord Shiva). Also, the other verses provided by Harry Spier are not found in any Jain puja.

  
  
कर्पूरगौरं करुणावतारं संसारसारं भुजगेंद्रहारम् ।  
सदा वसन्तं हृदयारविंद भवं भवानीसहितं नमामि ।  
श्री सिद्धिविनायकाय नमः । महानीरांजनदीपं समर्पयामि ।  
५८) कापुरारती  
( कापूर प्रदीप्त करून ओवाळावा.)  
कर्पूरपूरेण मनोहरेण सुवर्णपात्रोदरसंस्थितेन ।  
प्रदिप्तभासा सह संगतेन नीरांजन ते जगदीश कुर्वे ॥  
श्री सिद्धिविनायकाय नमः । कर्पूरार्तिक्यदीपं समर्पयामि ।  
  

Also, the particular Dipavali puja you provided has been composed by the Acarya of a modern sect, it is not followed by the majority of Jains.  
  
Best wishes,  
Manish
