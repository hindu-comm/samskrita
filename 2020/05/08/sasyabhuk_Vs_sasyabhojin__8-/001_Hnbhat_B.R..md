Both are correct for translation of vegitarian.

  

##### Shabda Sagara

सस्य  
n. (-स्यं)  
१. Fruit.  
२. Corn, grain.  
३. A weapon.  
४. A quality, an excellence.  
E. सस् to sleep, यत् Unādi aff; also शस्य, &c.

  

सस्य+भुक्/भोजिन् both mean one who eats sasya.

  

The first can be derived like the words ending in ज् like भिषक्/भिषग् - भिषजौ - भिषजःetc. The other like words ending इन् like करिन् करी, करिणौ - करिणः।
