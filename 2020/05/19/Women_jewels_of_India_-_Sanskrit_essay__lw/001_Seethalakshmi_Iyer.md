We used to recite an abridged Ramayanam called Nakshatra Ramayanam since my childhood, learnt in a Upanyasam,but in Tamil. It does not have the soft consonants like Sanskrit ,but,after learning Sanskrit lipi, I wanted to correct my pronounciation . Can someone help me to rewriteit? It is 27 verses Nakshatra Ramayanam e.g

Ambhoja Netram paraman pavithram

Aanandha roopam mahaneeya vandhyam

Vaikuntavasam saranam prabhadhye

Sri Ramachandram Charanam prabhadhye...

  

Thanks

  

Yours sincerely

Seetha
