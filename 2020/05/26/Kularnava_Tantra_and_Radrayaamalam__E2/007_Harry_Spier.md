Dear list members,

  
1) The Rudrayamalam uttaratantram with an english and hindi introduction and also with a hindi translation by Sudhakar Malaviya is available for download on [archive.org](http://archive.org) in two volumes. (links at the bottom of this posting).

  

2\) I'm working on a short hymn of 12 verses, the kuṇḍalinīstavaḥ from this tantra, .But there is much obscure tantric references in the hymn and having access to S. Malaviya's translation would help me immensely.
If any hindi speaker would be interested in translating into english Malaviya's hindi translation of these 12 verses please contact me off-list.

Thekuṇḍalinīstavaḥ is chapter 6 verses 29 thru 40 and starts in Volume 1 on page 114 and ends on page 117 .

  

Vol 1 download
