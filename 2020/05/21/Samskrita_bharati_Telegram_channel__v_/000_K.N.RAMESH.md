Namaste!

How would you like to watch and listen to short Samskritam clips every day?

  

In 2020, if improving sambhāṣaṇam is your resolution, here is a way to achieve that goal effortlessly.

  

प्रतिदिनं संस्कृतम्!

Telegram FREE App मध्ये SamskritaBharati (संस्कृतभारती) read-only गणः has been started, to materialize the vision of "प्रतिदिनं संस्कृतम्"!

  

The content would be enjoyable and varied. For example, we plan to bring कथाः, सुभाषितानि, गीतानि and even पुस्तक-परिचयः। The content would be posted during weekdays (Mon-Fri).
