देवार्थस्योपकरं does mean anything gramatically. It does not mean देवानामुपकारम् as सुहृदामुपकारम् and syntactically. It is correct देवार्थमुपकारम् and why you should change it when the structure is correct? Further, देवार्थ loses its significnce in compound. देवार्थं itself means for deva-s.

  

I won't suggest it.
