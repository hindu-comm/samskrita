It is correct in meaning in compoundand case. It compound specially with the word अर्थ with any word in dative meaning "for" the word in dative. It can be declined as an adjective to any noun taking the gender of the qualified noun. It is compounded as per the rule  
चतुर्थी तदर्थार्थबलिहितसुखरक्षितैः 2.1.36 and Vartika there underअर्थेन नित्यसमासवचनं सर्वलिङ्गता च वक्तव्या। ।. Here अर्थ is compounded with देव as an adjective for उपकार which is accusative as the object of अयाचत and takes also gender and case of upakara.

  

No other correction is needed. Hope it is clear. Doubts if any will be clered on request.
