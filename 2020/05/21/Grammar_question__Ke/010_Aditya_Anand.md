Namaskar Amba Ji

  

We are trying to teach Sanskrit to small kids, 7-11 here in Varanasi, beginning with simple sanskrit and Through Ashtadhyayi.

  

  

Along with Ashtadhyayi I always wanted to Introduce Coding to them. Can you suggest what and where to begin with?

  

Knowing your expertise in both fields we would highly appreciate your guidance and support.
