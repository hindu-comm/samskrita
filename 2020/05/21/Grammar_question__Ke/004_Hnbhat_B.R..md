His question is is it whther देवार्थं the use of accusative is correct? The agreement of gender and case between noun and adjective between देवार्थ उपकार solves the problem. The accusative case of Vishnu and Upakara is used because of double object of the verb याच्.

Proxixmity problem can be solved by replacing the words also देवार्थमुपकारं विष्णुमयाचत् or according to English word order.
