I did not get this. How are you teaching Sanskrit through Ashtadhyayi?

I do not have any experience of teaching small children. But I can share my experience of teaching programming to the Sanskrit Students.

  

I have students from Sanskrit background, who have very little knowledge of mathematics, since some of them are even from the Gurukula, where only elementary mathematics is taught.

  

Rather than teaching Coding (where you are making them think in a particular way; bound by the syntax of the programming language you are using), I would first like to teach algorithms.

  

I teach them the concepts of recursion, iteration etc through Pingala's chandashstra (the last chapter; suutras from 8.20 onwards).

And with examples from Panini, such as the 'it' kaarya, I introduce them the concept of regular expressions.

  

Best,

Amba Kulkarni
