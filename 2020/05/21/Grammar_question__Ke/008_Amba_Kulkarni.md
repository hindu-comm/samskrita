First of all, thank you Gérard for a little advertisement for my work.

  

Harry, you will find my article [here.](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/papers/sktsynOffprintAKulkarnietal.pdf)
I also have published a book recently titled 'Sanskrit parsing based on the theories of shabdabodha', published jointly by DK Publishers and IIAs Shimla.

  

My parser fails to handle such scramblings. But if you give the parser the unscrambled sentence

  

सर्वलोक-पितामहः देव-अर्थं उपकारं विष्णुम् अयाचत् (Note that I have split the compounds as well.)

then you will get  

![1.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/5c437b6ce9b26/1.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)  

  

The machine produces several other parses, but the 1st parse produced is the correct one.

  

Best,

Amba
