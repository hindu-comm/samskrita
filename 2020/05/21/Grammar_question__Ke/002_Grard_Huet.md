The problem Harry Spier is raising in not a problem of assigningkāraka semantic roles to the words in the sentence. From this point of view, the sentence is meaningful.

However, hereदेवार्थम् andउपकारम् co-denote the object of the request, whereasविष्णुम् denotes the person to whom the request is made, but it is inserted between the two,

thereby violating thesannidhi (proximity) requirement. In other words, the dependency structure is not a planar graph, you have crossing dependencies.

This scrambling is a cognition impediment: you can get the correct cognition not through grammatical means alone, you need real world reasoning to sort out the arguments.

This sannidhi violation is specially acute here: the two differentkārakas map to the same vibhakti (karman), and furthermore they agree in number and gender, thus the sentence is ambiguous.

Even though grammatical, the original sentence ought to be blamed I think. Unscrambling with a compound, as suggested by Harry inसर्वलोकपितामहो देवार्थोपकारं विष्णुमयाचत् solves the problem.

But note that in order to form this compound, he had to move उपकारम् next to देवार्थम्.

Such problems are discussed in Amba Kulkarni's monograph "Sanskrit parsing based on the theories of śābdabodha" (section 3.2 Sannidhi: Planarity Constraint).

She presents examples of scrambled sentences in (verse) classical litterature.
