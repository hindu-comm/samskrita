Namste.

  

Thank You for Your Reply.  

  

First we begin with teaching elementary Sanskrit as language then beging with remembering 1+1/4 pada of Ashtadhyayi. The organization is old one , Of Arya Samaj so follows the traditional of learning Sanskrit by Ashtadhyayi. It has successful tradition of teaching.

  

I am not the one teaching there, but I am involved with the Organisation.

The organization is Gurukul with kids from different background who are studing Sanskrit Grammar.

  

I myself have studied Ashtadhyayi there, as amateur, recently. I had studied some grammar like Laghusiddhanta but my subject of study is Nyaya-Vedanta. I wish if these Children were introduced with some sort of Coding which I wish to sponser to them.

  

I am not sure where to begin and thus if you could direct us to some sort of Coding that is related with Sanskrit, I would highlyappreciate it.
