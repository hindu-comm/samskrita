Dear Parameshwaran,  
I read a large portion of Govindaraja's commentary and some excerpts from other commentaries as well for the few articles that I wrote on Ramayana in my native language.  
  
There is a wonderful website where they gradually add many commentaries - <https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/>  
  
You may already know it. Yuddha-kanda is not yet there but the earlier books are, with multiple commentaries.  
  
Good luck in your research and namaste.
