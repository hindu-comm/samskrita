Namo Namaha,  
I have heard from very well read spiritual teachers of vedanta, that the Sankalapam in USA and every part of the world should only say "Bharata Varsha" based on the Bhagavatam 5th Canto. (entire Earth is Bharatavarsha). The link that Sri Ramesh ji shared shows it as Ramanaka Varsha.

Can someone point to the shastra-pramana on why USA is referred as Ramanaka Varsha? \[PramaNa for Bharata Varsha is the Bhagavatam\]

  

Dhanyavadaha  
Nagesh
