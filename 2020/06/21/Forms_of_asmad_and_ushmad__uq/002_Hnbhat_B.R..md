Sorry. Tyou message confused me by mentioning the words Asmad and Yushmad.

  

You wanted the forms of patha in Ist person and Second person.

  

|                |             |           | |----------------|-------------|-----------| |               |             | पठन्ति    | | II - त्वं पठसि | युवां पठथः | यूयं पठथ  | | I - पठामि     | आवां पठावः  | वयं पठामः |

This is the normal conjugation table. You will be learnin many other forms grasually.  Don't hurry.

  

Have patience.
