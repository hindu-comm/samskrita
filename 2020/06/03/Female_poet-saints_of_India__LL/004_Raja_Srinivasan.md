There is quite a list. Here is what I know:

  

1. Akka Mahadevi — a Kannada saint (10th or 11th century)

2. Avvaiyar — Tamil saint from the sangaam period (or maybe earlier?). There might have been multiple women saints who used this name over time.

3. Andal of course — one of the Azhwars

4. Mirabai.

5. Kanhopatra (14th or 15th century) Marathi saint

6. Lalleshvari (11th or 12th century) Saivite saint, said to be an avatar of Parvati-Mata

7. Gargi Vachaknavi — Rg Vedic times. She supposedly composed several of the hymns of the Rg Veda.

8. Maitreyi — 10 hymns of the Rg Veda are attributed to her.

9. Chudala — Mentioned in the Yoga Vashishta.

10. An unknown female saint, who appeared in the court of King Janaka and unmasked Astabakra

11. Saradha Devi (Ref: Swami Ramakrishna).

12. Ubhaya Bharathi — ref: Life of Sri Sankaracharya. She is supposed to have debated with Adi Sankara.

13. Gangasati — Gujarati Saint from the 11th or 12th century

14. Sakubhai — Another Marathi saint who has sung about Panduranga Vittala

15. Gosha Devi — some hymns of the Rg Veda are attributed to her.

16. The Mother. Mirra Alfassa, a follower of Sri Aurobindo. And a great modern saint.

17. Anandamai Ma. During her lifetime I did not consider her a saint.
But after reading about her and what she has accomplished, I would consider her a modern day saint.

18. Mahadevi — a queen who gave up everything for Lord Siva. Also called the Naked Mystic.

19. Atukuri Molla who rendered Valmiki Ramayana in local Telugu language.

20. Kanhopatra — a Bengali/Oriya saint who surrendered to Lord Krishna.

  

Please note, there are many more that this little list. I pay my respects to all of them and seek their blessings.
