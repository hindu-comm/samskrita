I have done my RSKS introductory course. Now, I want to learn advanced Sanskrit grammar, starting from LSK to Ashtadhyayi.

For this, I've figured out two ways, either I should pursue a majors in the subject. But I've got to pursue distance course alone, since I'm already pursuing my majors in Commerce.

If there is any college, which offers distance majors in Sanskrit Vyakaran, do let me know.

Otherwise, I might need an online sanskrit tutor. If anyone of you can teach me the texts, do let me know.
