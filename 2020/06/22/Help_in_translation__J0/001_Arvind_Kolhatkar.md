Theठक were a tribe of criminal robbers who looted and killed unwary travellers on the roads. They believed that they were religiously ordained to live on the the proceeds of this crime. Indian roads were infested by theठक till the first half of the 19th century but the British administrators succeeded in eliminating them under the leadership of Col Sleeman, for which he was called 'Thugee Sleeman'.

  

The English word 'Thug' is the corruption ofठक.
