Pranams Modiji.

  

Though I am not sure about the specific verse you are looking for, I have found a verse echoing almost a similar meaning in Chanakya Niti (Second Chapter - Verse 18) which might be of interest to you.  

  

बलं विद्या च विप्राणां राज्ञः सैन्यबलं तथा ।  
बलं वित्तं च वैश्यानां शूद्राणां च कनिष्ठिका ॥

  

The link for the above verse is - <https://archive.org/details/chanakya-Neeti/page/n33/mode/2up>

  

  

  

With regards,

Nagarajan K.
