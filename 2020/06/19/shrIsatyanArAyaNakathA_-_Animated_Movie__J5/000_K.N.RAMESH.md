To promote the language of Samskritam through visual arts, Samskrita Bharati (SB) will be creating and producing Samskritam Videos. On this auspicious day of Jyeṣṭha-pūrṇimā (Friday June 5, 2020), we are pleased to announce our project of making an animated movie based on Śrīsatyanārāyaṇakathā (SSNK) in simple Samskritam. This will be a collaborative effort that includes kāryakartās from SB-USA, SB-Canada and SB- Bhāratam. The script for the SSNK-animated movie is currently being reviewed in collaboration with an experienced animation studio in Bhāratam to produce the movie. We request Samskritam enthusiasts across the world to be part of this effort by supporting and promoting this new SB initiative through our GoFundMe campaign at <https://charity.gofundme.com/sbusa>

  

Please spread the word in your social media circle. For more details and to get an update about the SSNK-animated movie project, please visit [www.ssnk.ml](http://www.ssnk.ml)
