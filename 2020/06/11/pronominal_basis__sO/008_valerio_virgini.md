Nagaraj Paturi ji

  

My question is:

  

 Is युष्मद्‌ the base ? or Is त्वम्‌ the base ? or Is त्वद्‌ the base ? which is the correct base of all the forms in all the three numbers and all the seven cases?

Some grammars suggest that there are two themes (pronominal basis), one for the singular and one for the plural.

But elsewhere, the theme is indicated only with yuṣmat

I am not an expert in Sanskrit, so these different ways of indicating the "pronominal basis" have confused me.  
  
So, I thought "the pronominal basis" was discriminable by the first member of the compounds of the type मदर्थम्, त्वदर्थम्, अस्मदर्थम्, युस्मदर्थम् (but this is just a to try to understand)  

  

thanks
