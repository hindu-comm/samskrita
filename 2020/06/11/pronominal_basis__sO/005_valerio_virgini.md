I don't understand your statement there is or should be consistency in compound formation and pronouns.  

  

The coherence of which I speak, is not between pronouns and compounds, but between "pronominal bases" and and compounds.  

  

For example, वयम् does not have any correspondence/consistency for you with अस्मद् or its compound form मदर्थम्.  

  

वयम् has correspondence / consistency with अस्मद्, but the corresponding compound form is अस्मदर्थम् and not मदर्थम्  
  
अहम् has correspondence / consistency with मद्, and the corresponding compound form is मदर्थम्  
  
This is what I meant by correspondence / consistency.  

  

Thanks
