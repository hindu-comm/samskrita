Pronominal base is a descriptive grammatical tool used to derive various related forms from a certain form from which deriving all other forms is the most convenient for rule making.

  

युष्मत्‌ and अस्मत्‌ are the base forms taken that way for the various number and case forms of the second and the first person pronouns in Sanskrit respectively.
