I don't understand your statement there is or should be consistency in compound formation and pronouns. The difference is already explained by the rules of Panini and the forms are consistent with the rules applicable.

  

For example, वयम् does not have any correspondence/consistency for you withअस्मद् or its compound form मदर्थम्.

But it is consistent with the rule७.२.९३ यूयवयौ जसि. In the same way, the**same** way**,**  
the form तुभ्यम् is no consistency to its pronoun युष्मद् whereas it is consistent with the rule७.२.९५ तुभ्यमह्यौ ङयि or the form वः is not consistent withयुष्मद् or नः with अस्मद् or मद् where is thse are consistent with relative rules बहुवचने वस्नसौ which explain the substitutes.

  

That is why I quoted the related rules with the forms. You can take it as you like.

  

Thanking you
