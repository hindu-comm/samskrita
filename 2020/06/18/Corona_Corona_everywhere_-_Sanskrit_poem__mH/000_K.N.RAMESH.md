प्रासादे सा दिशि दिशि च सा पृष्ठत: सा पुर: सा

पर्यङ्के सा पथि पथि च तत्स्पर्शनेनातुरस्य ।

हंहो चेत: प्रकृतिरपरा नास्ति मे काऽपि सा सा

सा सा सा सा जगति सकले नाम तस्या: करोना ।।

\[A verse from Amaruśataka, slightly modified by me\].

  

She is in the palace. She is in every direction, behind and in front. She is on the bed and in every street for one sickened with her touch. There is no other element in this world for me, O my heart, there is only her her her her her and her in the whole world. Her name is Corona.

  

\[The original verse of Amaru describes the condition of a lovelorn person who is out of sorts due to separation from his beloved and feels her presence everywhere.\]
