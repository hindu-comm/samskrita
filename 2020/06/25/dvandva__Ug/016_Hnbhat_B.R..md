So your doubt is whether it is the compound of क्षेत्र॔ and क्षेत्रज्ञौ?

  

Where did did you get the idea of "the **two** **knowers** of the field" from the commentaries? I sid not see either in them.

  

My reply there is no such indication either from the compound or the explanation in the commentary.

  

It is normal dvandva compound क्षेत्रं च क्षेत्रज्ञश्च क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञौ, तयोःक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोः। And there is no twoक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज-s in the compound as you have interepreted. The commentators also do not mention about it.

  

Strange is your guessing and doubt.
