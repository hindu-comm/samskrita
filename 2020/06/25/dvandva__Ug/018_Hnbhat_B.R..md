O.k. It is the interptetation of two क्षेत्रज्ञs by taking it as a different compound than dvandva. It is not a question of grammat, but different differ interepretation. The compound is called as Madhyamapadalopi samasa and not dvandva and grammatically correct. compound. It is different from dvandva.

  

Thanks for bringing to my notice. Hope now it is clear. I am sorry for noticing it earlier.
