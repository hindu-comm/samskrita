There is no such rule for धातृ in compound and it should be धातृ only. The quoted rule is for dvandva compounds of words ending in ऋ only and also in condition of having relation between the words' meaning. Here the second member is not ending in ऋ and the rule quoted doesn't apply in this case.

  

By the way, it has another reading as वेधःशङ्कर instead in a printed page attached which is correct metrically and grammatically.
