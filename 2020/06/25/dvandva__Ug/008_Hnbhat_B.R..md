आनङ् ऋतो द्वन्द्वे – When the final term of the compound follows, there is a substitution of ‘आनँङ्’ (in place of the penultimate term) in a द्वन्द्व: compound whose terms – i) all end in the letter ‘ऋ’ and ii) denote a relationship either via knowledge/study or birth. (Since the parents are jointly involved in the birth of their offspring, they do have a relationship via birth.)

  

The rule is above commanding आ in dvandva compound for the first wod in the compound. And when the second word in पुत्र. The relation is birth and the first word be ending in ऋ.

  

The other examples of dvandva as per the rule:

1.होतापोतारौ। नेष्टोद्गातारौ। प्रशास्ताप्रतिहर्तारौ। where the first relation laid in the rule.

  

2.मातापितरौ। याताननान्दरौl for relation by birth.

extention to पुत्र:

पितापुत्रौ। मातापुत्रौ।

  

  

It is not प्रथमैकवचनम्, as in comound formation all the vibhakti- s will be lost and it is the substitution आनङ् for ऋ of the preceding word.

  

Other words I can think of are नप्तृ, स्वसृ, भ्रातृ .

  

The relation should be birth relation.
