Dear list members,

  

Can someone clarify for me which verbal tenses ofब्रू are correct to use?

  

Monier-Williams dictionary says:(onlypresentstem; the other forms are supplied by √vac) but he also shows usages for the past imperfect,.

  

Whtney's verbal roots lists present, perfect, aorist, future and other forms .

  

Apte's Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary says: (this root is defective in the non-conjugational tenses, its forms being made up fromvac) .I'm not clear what he means by "non-conjugational tenses"?

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
