Dear Sunder Ji, Thanks for the info. Can you please forward me the Italian translation link of Dharma Caurya Rasayana?

Sumedha ji, can you please send me the link of audio lecture about Muladeva? Is Muladeva also a fictitious character? And Steyashastra is a reality? I'm also looking for Steyashastra if anywhere it is available. And what is Bada Kaha?

Thanks and regards

Ajay Sharma
