As Mohan ji wrote above the story of the thief par excellence is a work of fiction which should be popularised.

I would trace this back to the lost Paisachi Prakrit Bada Kaha and the legendary thief, Muladeva. The story under discussion is an adaptation of one of his adventures which appear scattered through the Bada Kaha ( as we know from the Kathasaritasagara and the other Sanskrit, Marathi and Tamil versions of the Bada Kaha) as well as Jain and Buddhist story clusters. He is the master of the Steyashastra ( which has now been lost as the article mentions).

I have lectured on Muladeva and the art of thieving at the IGNCA in New Delhi ( an audio link is available) and he is an important character in my historical fiction series "Urnabhih" ( starting from Book 2 which will be out this year).
