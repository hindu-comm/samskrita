Regarding the information sought by Mr. Sharma, the 'Dharma Chaurya Rasayanam' (drs) is purely a work of fiction and does not contain anything on the subject of chaurya shastra, i.e., the science of thievery. It doesn't contain any mention about Lord Murugan or dhrutha kalpa or Atharva Veda.

  

Having said that, drs is a wonderfulwork of fiction which deserves much more exposure in the field of Indian literature. I request Sanskrit scholars and even those having a working knowledge on Sanskrit to concentrate on the translation of drs into their mother tongue. For your information, the writer of this reply is currently engaged in the task of getting drs translated into Malayalam.

  

Wishing drs more exposure, readership and publicity,

  

Regards,

  

Mohan Chettoor.
