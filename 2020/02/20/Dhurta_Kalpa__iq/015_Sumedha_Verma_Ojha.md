Dear Ajay ji,

Here is the link to the audio.

<http://ignca.gov.in/mausam/Mausam_lecture_20160524.mp3>

  

The lecture is on the dissemination of the three great story clusters of India The Ramayan, the Mahabharata and the Bada Kaha through maritime trade routes which depended on the monsoon winds.

I am not certain it will be on point for Dhurta Kalpa except for the part where the story of Muladeva is discussed.  

Best Regards,

Sumedha
