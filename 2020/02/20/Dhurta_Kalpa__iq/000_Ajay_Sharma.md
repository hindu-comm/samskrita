Hi, can I get Dhurta Kalpa of Atharva Veda and its translation in English? And is there any reference of Lord Murugan (Skanda) as a Lord of thieves? I'm researching on the subject. I did notfind relevant material reflecting these ideas. Am curious about Chaurya Shatra (or Chaurya Vidya) as a Sanskrit document.

I would appreciate if someone in the group throws light on the subject?

Thanks

Ajay Sharma
