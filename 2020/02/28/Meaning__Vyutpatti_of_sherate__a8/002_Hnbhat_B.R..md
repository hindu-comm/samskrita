The structure शरते स्म meaning were lying due to the rule that with स्म indeclinable the verb takes लट् to convey the past tense of the verb लट् स्म. It is not used here in the present tense. The subject of the verb is देहाः and it is plural form of the root√शी (शीङ् स्वप्ने, अदादि-गणः, धातु-पाठः २. २६) in लट् used in the past tense and not in the present tense.
