कथासरित्सागर  
Katha-Saritsagara   
By SOMADEVA

  

Gunadhya's Brhatkatha {Great Tale} in Prakrit is believed to be the oldest work in the history of world literature. Katha-Saritsagara is the Sanskrit re-telling of Gunadhya's Brhatkatha. It was put together (c.1070 CE) by a Kashmiri brahmin called Somadeva, who was the court poet of King Anantadeva of Kashmir. Somadeva Bhatta states that he wrote this work for the amusement of Queen Suryavati, wife of King Anantadeva.
  
  
KATHĀSARITSĀGARA literally means an ocean of the rivers of various stories. These stories present the realities of life in all its shades reflecting the 9 rasas.   
  
KATHASARITSAGARA tells of the adventures of Naravahanadatta, the future emperor of the Vidyadharas. Within the framework of this main story exist several charming and vibrant tales, over 350 in number. These subsidiary tales are tantalising and action-packed.   
  
Kathā Saritsāgara mirrors the life and weltanschauung of Ancient India, especially the golden period of sustained growth and prosperity under the Gupta kings.   
  
Katha-Saritsagara comprises of 21,388 shlokas in Sanskrit divided into 124 tarangas {Chapters} and 18 lambakas {Books}. Evidently, it is the oldest existing collection of stories in the world.   
  
Kathāsaritsāgara is nearly twice as long as Iliad’s Home and Odyssey combined.   
  
Kathāsaritsāgara tells of demi-gods and demons, faithful guards and foolish villagers, golden swans, magic pots and wooden automatons. Its stories abound with quirky offbeat characters like clever courtesans, incompetent kings, wise ministers, holy ascetics, wicked mendicants, men with boons, cursed men, non-human evil beings, and friendly magical beings.   
  
Kathā-Saritsāgara is culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilisation as we know it. So profound has been its influence that its stories are found all over the world. They appear in the Arabian Nights, in Celtic folklore, and in the collection of fairy tales made by the Brothers Grimm. In fact, the earliest recensions of the Panchatantra and the Vetala Pacchisi are both found contained in this text. (In lambakas 10 and 12, respectively).

  
Kathā-Saritsāgara is a timeless classic that will both entertain and enchant.
