I live in California. Mr Mody shipped these books to me and the cost of shipping was very reasonable. He processed the credit card payment and he was very prompt in his shippment. If you are thinking of Sanskrit, these books are a god send! They are being used in many online classes as well, so if you want to join the sanskrit VDSS classes, these books will come in very handy.

  

Thanks & Regards
