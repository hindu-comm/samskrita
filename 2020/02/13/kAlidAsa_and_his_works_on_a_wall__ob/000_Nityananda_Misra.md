Thought this may beof interest.

  

I attended the annual function of my children’s school at the Mahakavi Kalidas Natayamandir in Mumbai yesterday. This

  

At the entrance, I was pleasantly surprised to see this creative wall sculpture showing Kālidāsa in the centre surrounded by scenes from his immortal works. At the right is a scene from the third canto of Kumārasambhava: Kāma shooting an arrow at Śiva as Pārvatī watches. At the top right is a depiction of Meghadūta: a Yakṣa sending a message to his beloved via the clouds. At the top is supposedly a scene from Raghuvaṃśa: a prince praying to the four-armed Viṣṇu, I say supposedly as such a scene does not occur in the Raghuvaṃśa if I remember correctly (it is the gods who pray toViṣṇu, whereas here theprince looks more like Arjuna beholding Kṛṣṇa in the Gītā). At the left is a scene from Abhijñānaśākuntala (Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā), I say this based on the deer depicted nearby (the play begins with Duṣyanta chasing a deer). At the top left is a couple under a tree, could be either Agnimitra and Malavikā from Mālvikāgnimitra, or Vikrama and Ūrvaśī from Vikramorvaśīya, or a couple enjoying the seasons as described in the Ṛtusaṃhāra.
