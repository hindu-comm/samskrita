IT doesn't make any sense. PLEASE let me know exactly in which section the story occurs, so that I can check in the text available in Vikisource where Sanskrit text is available.

  

As it is presented by you, it dose not make any sence.

  

From Subhashita, it reads as

  

सत्त्वोच्छ्रिते मृगपतौ राजेति गिरः परिणमन्ति।  

  

meaning The words as "The king" are used in the case of superior powered lion, ...with all the adhectives mentioned.

  

Check in the source.
