The Puranas are an important genre of Hindu religious texts, notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of cosmology, philosophy, and rituals.   
  
The Puranas form the bulwark of the Sanatana Dharma. They are believed to be the Sun that banishes the darkness of ignorance from the hearts of those who read them.   
  
The Bhagavat Mahapurana is seen as the most important among all the Puranas. This work is a superbly accurate Hindi translation of the authentic Bhagavata Purana.  
  
The standard of this translation, as well as the quality of the publication is excellent. We are proud to distribute this text from our bookstore and through mail order. We ship books all over the world and accept payment by BHIM, IMPS, NEFT, Paytm, Visa and MC.
