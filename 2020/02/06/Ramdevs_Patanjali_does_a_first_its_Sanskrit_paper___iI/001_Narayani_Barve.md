I thought the title of this news is misleading. It says that Sanskrit paper makes to international journal. I thought paper is written in Sanskrit. But the paper is in English. Here is a copy of the paper. Also there are some controversiesaround this publisher. Here are details.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI#Controversies>.

  

By no means I want to deny the authenticityof this published manuscript. But publishing with a controversialpublisher, is a disservice to the topic, in this case Ayurveda.  

  

Regards,

Narayani
