There are two different suffixes kvasu which is used in the past perfect sense in Vedic usage. But the present particle as per the Panian rule specially for deriving the word vidvas as perAshtadhyayi sutra 7\|1\|36 (Kaumudi 3105) - विदेः शतुर्वसुः.

  

As a general understanding, the Vedic suffix is not used in non-vedic usage and limited to Vedic usage in Vedic texts.Hence for derivation of vidvas, special rule is provided by Panini for general usage. It is not our choice, though the declension may be the same.
