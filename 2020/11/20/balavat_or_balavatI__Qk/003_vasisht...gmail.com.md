Thank you Nagaraj,

Why I'm asking the question.  
As you point out परित्रस्ता agrees with अत्रभवती so it is feminine.

But परित्रस्ताis a past participle and as you also point out बलवत् qualifies it .

Does that mean that words qualifying participles are put in the neuter accusative case.?

Does that mean words qualifying any verbal form (participles, gerunds, infinitives etc) are put in the neuter accusative case.?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
