Dear list members,

I would like to have Kavya Darpana by Rajachudamani Dikshita in its entirety which was published in Telugu script. I can not recall the publication details. S.Subrahmanya Sastriâ€™s edition of the same in Devanagari, available from [archive.org](http://archive.org), contains only six Ullasas.

Any information in this regard will be most welcome.

Thanking you in advance,  S. Jagannatha.
