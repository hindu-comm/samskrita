On page V of this book (<https://archive.org/details/HarkarePratyayakosaOCR/page/n7/mode/2up>) six published works of Harkare have been mentioned.

  

Could someone pls help me locate the following books  

  

1\. Index to Astadhyayi

2\. An Atlas with colours showing different subjects in Astadhyayi

3\. An Atlas showing the Adhikaras

4\. An easy explanation of Sutras.

  

Kind Regards

Agni
