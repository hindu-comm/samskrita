Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. It has been a couple of months since my last posting as "Working From Home" actually ended up as a synonym for working extended hours with very little time for pursuing other interests!

  

As **Adi Pooram** falls on this Friday (24-Jul-2020), I am delighted to share a rare hymn on **Goddess Prithvi** by **Lord Narayana** from **Brahma Vaivarta Puranam**, **Prithvi Khanda** and **Chapter 8**. This hymn contains a short **Dhyna Shloka**, **Moola Mantra** and **Sotram** on **Goddess Prithvi**.

  

For the benefit of non-Tamil audience **- Adi Pooram** is predominantly celebrated in Tamil Nadu as the occasion of birth of **Sri. Andal** (also known as **Godha**), who is an incarnation of **Goddess Prithvi**. She, as well as her father (**Sri Periyazhwar**) are counted as among the **12 Azhwars**. She has authored the famous **Thiruppavai**, which is recited during the month of **Margashirsha** (Dec-Jan) in South India. In all **Vishnu Temples** in Tamil Nadu, one can find separate **Sannadhis** for **Lakshmi** (Sridevi) and **Andal** (Bhoodevi).  

  

The short **Phalashruti** at the end of the stotra declares that one who worships **Goddess Prithvi** gets the benefit of performing **100 Ashwamedha Yagas**. May we pray to **Goddess Prithvi/Andal** with this beautiful hymn.

  

With best regards and pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
