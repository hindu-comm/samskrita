I could not correctly understand his question.

  

As I can understand the word लिङ्ग should have been in masculine, because शिश्न denoting the genitials is masculine. He is correct about the word शिश्न. as given in the Amara lexicon, only that word is in masculine gender and the remaining synonyms मेढ्र, मेहन and शेफः are in neuter gender.

  

"शिश्नो मेढ्रं मेहनशेफसी"  

  

In Sanskrit the gender is not based on sex or synonym. So there is nothing gramatically wrong in using लिङ्ग in neuter gender. Every word has a fixed gender and some are used in both feminine, and some in three genders. They are to be understood from the dictionarie and not by logic.

  

One best example with multiple genders are the words for wife. भार्या, जाया, and पत्नी aew used in femine gender, while the word कलत्र is used in neauter gender and the word दारा is used in masculine and used in only plural. This will makes clear that the words for the same thing need not belong the same gender.

  

As to the question, it is mentioned Amara as having used in two different meanings

  

"लिङ्गं चिह्न-शेफसोः"  

  

i.e. chihna and genitials in the neuter gender only.
