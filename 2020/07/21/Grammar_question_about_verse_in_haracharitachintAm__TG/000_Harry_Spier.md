Dear list members,

  

There are a couple of grammar points about Verse 6 of chapter 27 ofहरचरितचिन्तामणि I'm not clear about.

  

. . . साब्रवीद्देवी स्मेरीकृतविलोचना \|\| ५ \|\|

सत्यं यदि प्रसन्नोऽसि किंचिदाख्याहि सत्कथाम् \|

कस्यापि वर्तते या न विदिता परमेश्वर \|\| ६ \|\|

The english translation I have for this is: . . .the Goddess replied, her eyes smiling, "If you are truly pleased with me, tell me some fine story which is not known to anyone, greatest lord".

1\) I don't understand why itsकिंचिद् neuter accusativeand not कांचिद् feminine accusative..

Isn't this an adjective of the feminine accusative wordसत्कथाम् so it should also be feminine accusative ?

I.e.कांचिदाख्याहि सत्कथाम् \| "Tell me some fine story".

  

2\) I don't understand why itsकस्यापि and not केनापि = "by anyone"

I.e.केनापि वर्तते या न विदिता "which is not known by anyone".

  

Thank you,

Harry Spier
