Namaste Everyone,  

  

This is a short prayer to Sri RamanujAcharyA that I composed in Sanskrit inspired by a Tamil song I listened to. While I am not qualified to write about a saint like Sri Ramanuja, I have made a humble attempt to highlight some of the important milestones in his life, his divine qualities and his contribution.

It can be also used as a teaching aid to learn dvitIyA vibhaktiH..  

  

Regards

Maheshwari
