namasarvebhyaH,

I have submitted a comedy skit in Samskritam that highlights the generation gap between the kids and the parents. During COVID lockdown families spend more time together than usual. This skit explores the differences that manifest in a family as well as the resulting surprises that come out of it and how the family comes together finally!

Feedback welcome.

Sriram
