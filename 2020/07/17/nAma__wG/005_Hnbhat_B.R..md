I had shown the derivation as given in English and Sanskrit dictionaries.  
  
They show the etymology from two different roots nam and mnaa. Difference is karman and others cited by you that karman etc. have root कृ+मन् have man part belonging to suffix part clearly, but in naaman the ma part belongs to the root itself as नामयतीति. Inम्नायते इति in the deffinition the man somehow is related to the suffix.
