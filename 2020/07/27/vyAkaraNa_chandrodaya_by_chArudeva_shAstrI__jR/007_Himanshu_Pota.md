Every single book by Charudev Shastri, including Upasarga-artha-chandrika,is worth its weight in gold.  
  
Is it possible to purchase copyright from Motilal Banarasidas or request them to reprint these books?

  

I presume there are scholars in this group you have connections with Govt of India or Motilal who can make this happen.

  

Thanks.
