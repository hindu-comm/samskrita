Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As Sri Kalki Jayanti is on Saturday (25-Jul-2020), I am delighted to share a short hymn on Lord Bhagavan by Lord Brahma taken from Bhavishya Puranam, Kriya Khanda and Chapter 2. Lord Bhagavan grants the boon that one who prays with this hymn will never face any misfortune.

  

As mentioned before, there are very few hymns I have come across on Avatars like Kalki Avatar - I had already shared what I have come across.

  

May We Pray To Lord Kalki with this potent hymn!

  

With best regards and pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
