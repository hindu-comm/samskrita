THERE are special significance of the डु and ञ् annexed to the root. It is because ofञ् it is used as both परस्मैपदी and  
आत्मनेपदी according to the ruleस्वरितञितः कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफले १।३।७. And due toडु that the word कृत्रिम is derived.

Totally the root कृ is used in the sense of doing or to do. This is the way all the roots are listed in धातुपाठ or the list of roots in Sanskrit. You can find it here:
