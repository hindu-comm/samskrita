\*About the Course\*

Sriman Narayaneeyam composed by Melpatthur Narayana Bhattathiri, is a monumental work. It is a condensation of the Srimad Bhagavata Purana into 1036 concise, poetic, and esoteric verses impregnated with devotion to the Lord. It has an inimitable splendour and is complete with the grace of Guruvayurappan.

It is composed by Narayana, and is about Narayana, and hence is aptly named Narayaneeyam. The Stotra is known to grant the chanter, longevity, good health and bliss unbounded.
