For the seeker, life is an unceasing quest for the highest truth. His inquiring mind tries to gain an insight into the working of the universe. Spiritual seekers have always sought answers to life's eternal questions: Is there a God? Is there life after death? How do we know right from wrong?

  

The Jinas walked the path of enlightenment and liberation. Upon attaining enlightenment, they shared their insights with others. Their chief disciples, the gaṇadharas, transmitted their teachings and crystallised them into twelve sacred books called the āgamas. These were composed in Prakrit and contained the essence of the Jinas' teachings.

  

With time, it was felt that Jain teachings needed to be conveyed in Sanskrit and thus Ācārya Umāsvāmī (aka Vācaka Umāsvātī), a leading Jain thinker of his time, composed the Tattvārthasūtra nearly 2000 years ago, in concisely written Sanskrit aphorisms.

  

The Tattvārthasūtra has ten chapters. Each chapter explains some aspect of universal reality, from the nature of the soul to the consequences of karma. This work is widely read, most frequently referred to, and highly acclaimed as a work of central importance to the Jain faith. It is deeply revered by all Jains. It has engendered several detailed exegetical works and commentaries in Sanskrit, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Gujarati and Tamil.   
  
The present work is an excellent Hindi translation of this most profound work on Jain philosophy. The Hindi translator, Dr Jaykumar Jalaj is known from the accuracy and beauty of his translations. The original Sanskrit text has been edited by Pandit Dharamchand Sanghi, a scholar of Kātantra Vyākaraṇam.   
  
We are proud to publish this superbly translated and elegantly produced text as part of the prestigious Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series. Bearing in mind the importance of this text, we have published this book on 100 gsm parchment paper, said to last far longer than normal paper.
