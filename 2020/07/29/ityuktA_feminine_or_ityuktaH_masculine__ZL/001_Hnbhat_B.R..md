Please give complete verse. As it is it is not clear whom he is addressing.

  

The verb परिवर्तयेध्वम् relates to you in plural and not in singular as you have suggested. It can be masculine or feminine plural as इत्युक्ताः and not इत्युक्ता or इत्युक्तः in the verse you cited.

  

Hope this would clear your doubt.
