Dear Esteemed samskrita group memebers,  
I had recently enrolled in SB Dakshina Tamil Nadu to learn Sanskrit language. As a first part of the level, I was preparing a handy excel sheet for dhatus and it’s various lakaras and pratyayas for it’s corresponding dhAtu. While SNB themselves have prepared a table for it, I found some frequently used kriyapadas were not included, which help me to write SambhaShanams and kathas.  
At this point, I found difficult to find Karmani forms , pratyaya format (like -kta, -tva, -tum, -tvakta pratyayams to name few) for some Ātmanepada, Ubhayapada dhAtus. When I find in some websites,(like [spokensanskrit.org](http://spokensanskrit.org)) I couldn’t get its  
meaning for above forms.  
  
Can somebody help me to learn above mentioned grammatical terms?  
You can support me with sharing me e-books / links.  
Preferably with a English/ Tamil explanations.  
  
धन्यवाद:॥
