Dear Mohan,

  

The Puranic Index by RAMACHANDRA DĪKSHITAR, V. R.



(1951-55).

  

Koln University online version:<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PUIScan/2020/web/index.php>

  

has the following entry:

  

*Gajāsura*— killed by Gaṇeśa (Śiva-*M.P.*).

  
Br. IV. 27. 98 and 101. M. 55. 16.

  

Note: from the front materialBr.= Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa and M. = Matsya-purāṇa

  

I couldn't find an entry for*Gajāsura*in Mani's The Puranic Encyclopedia.

  

Hope this is of some help.
