I feel sad at this news. I don’t know Dr Sunder Hattangadi , never met him, never had any direct communication with him and he does not know about me.

I - as a rather passive, but regular reader of this group's discussions – have been reading his contributions with great enjoyment and learnt a lot. I Did not know anything about him, his age or that he was a psychiatrist by profession or his family background, yet the feeling of loss of a known person is there, solely arising due to “having met him” in this forum barely a few years ago! Shall continue to refer to his writings which remain even after he has ascended to the highest spiritual plane!
