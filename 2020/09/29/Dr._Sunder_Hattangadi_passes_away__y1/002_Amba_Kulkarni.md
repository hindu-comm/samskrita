Though we never met in person, I had several mail exchanges with him in the early days of Sanskritdocuments website, during early 2000.  

He did an excellent service to the Indians, and for Sanskrit, by developing this website and digitizing several Sanskrit works.  

I express my gratitude to his soul for his contribution to Digitisation of Sanskrit texts.

  

May his soul attain sadgati.
