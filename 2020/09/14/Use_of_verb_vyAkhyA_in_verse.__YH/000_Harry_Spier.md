Dear list members,

  

Firstly thank you to Ajit Krishnan for sending me the commentary on theBhagavatī-padya-puṣpāñjalī-stotram by Swami Kashikanandagirijiand to Dr. Bhat and E.T. Dilip for their explanations to my previous questions on the stotram.

  

Swami Kashikanandagirijistarts his commentary with this verse.

वन्दे भगवतीमम्बां महिषासुरमर्दिनीम् \|

व्याख्यास्ये ऽथातिसंक्षेपात्तत्पुष्पाञ्जलिमादरात् \|\|

In the verse doesव्याख्यास्ये . . . तत्पुष्पाञ्जलिम् mean:

1) I will explain this offering of flowers.  
(whereपुष्पाञ्जलिr refers to the stotra he will be commenting on.)

or

2)I will call this \[my commentary\] Pushpanjali.

(whereपुष्पाञ्जलिr is a name he's given his commentary.)  

Thanks,  
Harry Spier
