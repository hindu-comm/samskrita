The verb व्यख्यास्ये is common for commentary on a work than to call something a name. Secondly tat refers toभगवती in the previous verse. So naturally the object is तत्पुष्पाञ्जलि as the name of the work and could not be possible he is naming the work. The editor's choice to name the stotra asBhagavatī-padya-puṣpāñjalī-stotram as I can see. Others may differ as the verb aa-khyaa is used to say or call a name.
