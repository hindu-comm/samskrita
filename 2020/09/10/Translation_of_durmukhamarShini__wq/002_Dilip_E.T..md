दुर्धरधर्षिणि  

a.she who has overpowered Demon Durdhara (literally meaning Unrestrainable/ unstoppale)

[b.it](http://b.it) could be mean that she overcomes the unstoppable in a generic sense

  

दुर्मुखमर्षिनि  

c\. she endured Demon Durmukha (literally meaning Foul-Mouthed or heinous faced)

[d.it](http://d.it) could be she Who tolerates the ignorant

  

The b,d variants of meaning are a bit philosophical and being a goddess suits Durgadevi
