Dear list members,

I'm not clear about the translation ofदुर्मुखमर्षिनि in verse 2
ofBhagavatī-padya-puṣpāñjalī-stotram.

  

Doesदुर्धरधर्षिणि दुर्मुखमर्षिनि in the verse mean:

1. The one who attacks the demon Durdhara and who is patient with the demon Durmukha, meaning "The One who attacks the demon Durdhara while patiently waiting to attack Durmukha".

or

2. The One who attacks the demon Durdhara while enduring Durmukha, meaning "The One who attacks the demon Durdhara while enduring the attacks of Durmukha".

  

or something different.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
