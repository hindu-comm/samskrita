If you are looking for a good book to learn about Kartari, Karmani and Bhave prayogas, then I suggest 'PrayogaVistarah' (प्रयोगविस्तरः) by Shri Janardana Hegde, published by Samskrita Bharati. As the book is oriented towards students of Samskrit, it is quite comprehensive & has many examples and exercises. This inexpensive book should be available in all Samskrita Bharati offices and on their online website.
