Dear members,

  

Could you please help me understand how to construct simple future tenses (lṛṭ) in passive voice (karmaṇi) for both ātmanepada and parasmaipada verbs? For example how would one write : "I will have this done" in sanskrit?  

  

The verbs tables I've referred to don't seem to show this type of construction at all. Is it that such a construction is not possible in sanskrit?

  

Thank you

Regards

madhav
