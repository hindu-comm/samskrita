In future tense, since there is no -ya- suffix we just put the verb in its ātmenepada form. So, this will be done by me would be "idaṃ mayā kariṣyate".

I just remember one form in case of the verb 'gam' in which the future passive forms differ. They are 'gaṃsyate', 'gaṃsyete' etc., not 'gamiṣyate'.
