Namaste. With immense content, I wish to communicate that round-1 \*'Digitisation of Vedas'\* is now completed (excel file attached), after 8+ years of team effort. The current version includes Veda Mantras in original and translations in Sanskrit and Hindi.

  

Next, we embark to include translations in other languages as well. An updated version of the complete database can be downloaded from [www.VedaKosh.Com](http://www.VedaKosh.Com).

  

The task would not have been possible without the support and blessings of many. However, I cannot miss to bow before:

a\. Panini Grammarian - \*Acharya Chandra Dutta Sharma\* \<[aryava...@gmail.com]()\> for proof reading

b\. \*Professor Dr. Naresh Kumar Dhiman\* \<[dhim...@yahoo.com]()\> for his continuous guidance and help

c\. \*Shri Dharampal Arya\* for funding and guidance. [www.वेद.com](http://www.xn--j2b3a4c.com)
