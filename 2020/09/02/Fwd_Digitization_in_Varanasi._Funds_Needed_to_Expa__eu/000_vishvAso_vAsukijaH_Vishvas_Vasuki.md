A worthy cause to support  

  

---------- Forwarded message ---------  

  

Dear friends,

  

If you are aware of any organisations/individuals who might be able to fund eGangotri's rare Sanskrit manuscript digitisation in Varanasi, please get in touch with me or the founder Chetan (cced). They have a proven track record of tremendous efficiency: Every month, 200+ rare Sanskrit manuscripts will be made publicly available with a monthly donation of just Rs. 15,000 (see below for details). The scans will all be credited to the funders.

  

Tens of thousands of manuscripts and books have already been digitized and made freely available on [archive.org](http://archive.org).

Subject: Digitization in Varanasi. Funds Needed to Expand Operations

Dear Suhas Mahesh:

  

So we are inside Sampurnananda University in Varanasi one of the oldest Sanskrit Unis in the country.

  

2 Organizations:  
  
Jangamwadi Math - one of the 5 Main Peethas of Veer Shaivism/Lingayat.  
  
atleast 500 years old  
  
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community/Shri-Kashipeeth-Jangamwadi-Math-Varanasi-740809342640143/>  

  

and

  

Bharat Dharma Maha Mandal  
[Shri Bharat Dharam Maha Mandal Varanasi](http://shribharatdharmamahamandal.org/)

  
both teeming with Book Antiquities and Rare Manuscripts.  
  
have given us a Red Carpet welcome to come and scan.  

  

We are also liasing with Goenka Library in Lalita Ghat - one of the richest Tantric Collections of Printed Books - also recipient of all of Gopinath Kaviraj's Collection.

  

These organizations are Oceans where we would need atleast a decade to do justice to there Books.

  

I have exhasuted my resources already. I cannot spread my wings in these Organizations if someone doesn't come up with external Help.

  

Operating Costs tend to be low.

  

Setting up a 1-Operator Team requires an initial 1-Time investment of 90K in the form of a purchase of following equipment:

  

1\. Ryzen-5 HP Laptop: 45K

2\. Czur ET 16 Plus Scanner: 37K

3\. Internet Model: 4K

4\. UPS: 2K  
  
Operator Salary/Internet Charges/Operational Miscellaneous Expenses: 15K/Month

  

Therefore if someone pays us 90K(1300 USD) one time. and then merely 15K/month(200 USD). we can have One Center set-up with turn-over rate of 3000 pages/Day.

  

This adds to approximately 72,000 pages in 6 Day Work Week month. if an average book is 300 pages, thats 240 books/month.  
  
Additionally, any body who funds my Center , I will give full credit to the Source of Funding; every page of every PDF Document will have the following Footer:

  

for example if it is you who are funding:

  

**CC-0. Jangamwadi Collection. Digitized by Suhas. Bangalore**

  

OR the **Institutional Name** if any

  

This way every time the hundreds of pdfs that are scanned in a month, each upon download will publicize your effort to make Heritage universally availablefor perpetuity.

  

So 90K in INR one time and 15K INR/month will sustain one center fully.

  

These figures for anyone living abroad are peanuts but in terms of the dissemination of critical Knowledge incalculable in importance.
