It can mean in both ways. It has been translated as commented as तोडिताः and translated as chopped off as adjective for शुण्डा already there in the verse. Otherwise वितुण्डिताः made trunkless which can be taken as adjective forशुण्डा or directly for the elephants which will be least possible.

  

Hope this may be clear.
