It is not the derivation of word क्षत्रिय of the but the word क्षत्त्र combining two words क्षत्+त्र that is given in Raghvamsha by Kalidasa in a verse“क्षतात् किल त्रायत इत्युदग्रः क्षत्त्रस्य शब्दो भुवनेषु रूढः”R.२.५३;११.६९,७१. It is the etymological derivation क्षत्त्र suggested in the verse that is used for the word क्षत्रिय generally and there are not two words in the word क्षत्रिय .

  

Do you have any sourse that says the word रक्षा is composed of two words?t  

is is composed of two words the first is क्षतात् + र?
