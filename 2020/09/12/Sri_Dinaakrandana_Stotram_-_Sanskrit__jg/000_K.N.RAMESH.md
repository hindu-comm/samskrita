जीवामि चेदथ पृथुप्रियविप्रयोग –

रोगादयो नरकदु:खभियोऽन्यथाऽपि ।

घ्नन्त्येव मामुभयथाऽप्यसुखोऽहमित्थम्

अत्रोचितं हर चर स्वकृपालुताया:   ॥२९॥

29\. If I were to live, separation from very loved ones, diseases etc. do keep tormenting me. Otherwise, if I were to die, the fear of misery in hells does torment me. Both ways, I am in deep trouble. O Hara! do act appropriate to your own compassionate nature in this matter.
