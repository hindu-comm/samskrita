Namaste,

  

I have a question on sandhi of the following:

तान् + शंसति = ताञ्छंसति

  

Can someone help me here with the प्रक्रिया of this? I can use स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः to change न् to ञ्, but I am not sure how श् changes to छ् . शश्छोऽटि is not applicable here because ञ् is not in झय् प्रत्याहार.
