What you have written is 1 of the four possible forms given above and the prakriya is given gradually following the rules applied. You had missed the earler steps taking तुक् which is lost before छ and in the final stage you can without च substituted for त् by श्चुत्व. श्चुत्व has to be applied seperately for त् and न्. That is why you were confused.

  

Hope this is clear. The changes in the four forms are listed in a verse given in the beginning which is given in LS. If anything not clear wiil be explained if requested.
