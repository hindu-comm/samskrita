I feel, it will be very useful for the current age. If it were made available in searchable unicode format (eg text, doc, odt, html etc), its usefulness will increase. Still better if it is published on some website (may be wordpress, google sites or some other). If it is felt that the list still needs to be improved, it can be hosted at some wiki where it can be collaboratively edited and enhanced.

Note : Devanagari unicode has 'pUrNavirAm' symbol as '।' which should be used instead of pipe '\|' . Both look similar but the height of pipe is much bigger than '। ' and other characters of Devanagari.
