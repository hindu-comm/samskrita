There is no doubt that the list is very useful. But the problem with this file is only 'partially' searchable. It is a well known problem that non-Latin Unicode content, if converted to PDF, becomes 'corrupted' and the original text is irrecoverable.  

  

If this list could be shared by the publishers in epub, html or even in \*.doc format, it would be free from the above problem.
