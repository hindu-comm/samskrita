Shreevatsa ji, could you please describe in a bit more detail the procedure for converting documents containing Unicode text into PDF such that the resulting PDF is searchable and the text in it is recoverable without loss?. May be here or on some other website. Or, else please direct us to such information already available. If it is precise and written in context with Devanagari and other Indian scripts, the better.
