I am learning the commentary of soubhagya bhasakara, but it is not given according to the name in [archive.org](http://archive.org). So I thought to digitalize it according wise, so that any one interested in a particular name can directly go and see it.

Before this I want to confirm weather there is any work in sanskrit which already digitilized this commentary.

  

Thank you

Adarsh
