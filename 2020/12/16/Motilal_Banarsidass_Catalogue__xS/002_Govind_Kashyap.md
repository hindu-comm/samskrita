Thank you for sharing the MLBD catalogue and your thoughts. I had visited the MLBD Delhi bookstore some years ago to buy some books and found it to be, even then, not very vibrant. The news of their shutting down other physical stores now and their concentrating on their digital presence too doesn't surprise me, given the online buying habits of people that has achieved a critical mass of its own, and the push towards digital operations that the Chinese coronavirus has given to the entire world. MLBD, in this respect, is following the (Indian and) global trend.

  

It is a fact that Indology is a niche interest and Indological publishing a niche market in the overall publishing space. A significant chunk of Indian Indological publishers' revenue comes from foreign buyers, mostly academic. The Indian public's interest in Indology mostly remains confined to aspects touching popular religion and spirituality.  

  

GIta Press is doing well, as you mention. But their list is severely limited. They cannot be considered a full-spectrum Indological publisher till they expand (and add to their excellent puranic literature list).
