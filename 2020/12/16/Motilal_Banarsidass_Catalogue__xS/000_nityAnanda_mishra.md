I received this catalogue from Motilal Banarsidass (MLBD) today. Forwarding the same as members will find it useful. As with Chaukhambha, I am not associated with MLBD in any capacity.

  

Along with the catalogue, I have some bad news to share (some members would know it already). When I rang up the number listed for the Mumbai MLBD bookstore in Mumbai today, I came to know it has shut down permanently. It used to be located at Bhulabhai Desai Road earlier near Mahalakshmi Mandir. I had visited this store several times inearly2000s and purchased many books there. The store had later moved to Nana Chowk near Grant Road Station. Later today when I spoke with Sh. Rajendra Prakash Jain, he told me that the footfalls at the Mumbai store had reduced a lot and they had no option left but to close it. There is more bad news. The MLBD bookstore in Bengaluru is also permanently closed. This was located in Jayanagar, 1st Block, very close to Cloud Nine hospital. I had visited this store also several times in late2000s and purchased many here. And yet more. Sh. Jain told me the Delhi bookstore has also been reduced in size. He said they are moving to an online business model. It seems the MLBD bookstore in Kolkata also shut down long back. It is very sad to see one of our oldest and finest publishing houses shutting down bookstores all over the country.

  

Meanwhile the Gita Press book shop in Kalbadevi, Mumbai, is still open. When I visited the store before the lockdown, there were many customers there. Footwear is left outside, the staff is very friendly, and there are discounts on almost every book purchased.
