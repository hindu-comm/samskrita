Dear Nityananda ji,  
Jay Jinendra  
  
This is a universal problem!  
  
They have simply stopped using pancama varnas, purna virama symbols, etc. in Hindi. Even the best Hindi dictionaries use the anusvara to spell Hindi!  
  
It is quite annoying. And prevents readers from being able to pronounce words correctly. Modern Hindi publishing has done away completely with the candrabindu as well. Other than my own publications, I do not find candrabindus printed anywhere else, except in older publications.  
  
I have gone through five or six commonly used Hindi grammar books. None of them spell the word पुँल्लिङ्ग correctly.  
  
Bhai, let us revive your project of creating a free for use Devanagari font which is universally accepted by all platforms.  
  
Best wishes,  
Manish
