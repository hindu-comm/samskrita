It is good to see that at least some (or all?) ‘vaiyākaraṇas’ of Karnataka like S Jagannatha have preserved the ‘pañcama varṇas’ in in Kannada script. It hurts to see that verses of even original verses of the ‘Bhagavad-Gītā’ are printed with the ‘anusvāra’ replacing ‘pañcama varṇas’ where it should not. No offence to anybody, but the highlighted ‘anusvāra’s in the screenshot from the ‘Bhagavad-Gītā’ are incorrect.
