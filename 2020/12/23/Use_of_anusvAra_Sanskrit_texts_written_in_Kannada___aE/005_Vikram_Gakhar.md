Dear [drk...@gmail.com](),   

  

1. ‚Äú‚Ä¶why not write Hindi in a write as you pronounce‚Ä¶‚Äù   

In the paragraph you have written under the title ‚ÄòHindi heard in a speech‚Äô, you have made 6 changes to the standard spellings. I am assuming all of these are intentional and not introduced by the editing software. I will give my reasons why each of these is untenable.  

  

1.1 All instances of short ‡§á have been replaced with long ‡§à and all instances of long ‡§ä have been replaced with short ‡§â (e.g. ‡§π‡•Ä‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä and ‡§∞‡•Å‡§™) The assumption seems to be that in spoken Hindi there is no length distinction in these two vowels. That is certainly not the case. Native Hindi speakers do differentiate between short and long ‡§á/‡§à and ‡§â/‡§ä and not just in pairs of words that would become indistinguishable otherwise:  

 ‡§¨‡§ø‡§®/‡§¨‡•Ä‡§®, ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§æ/‡§™‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ  

 ‡§™‡§ø‡§∏‡§®‡§æ/‡§™‡•Ä‡§∏‡§®‡§æ, ‡§õ‡§ø‡§≤‡§®‡§æ/‡§õ‡•Ä‡§≤‡§®‡§æ - Are we talking about the cook or the ingredients? üòä   

 ‡§∏‡•Å‡§§/‡§∏‡•Ç‡§§   

 ‡§â‡§®/‡§ä‡§® ‡§¨‡§ø‡§® ‡§ï‡§ü‡•á ‡§® ‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‚Äì Are we talking about the rainy season or winter? üòä   

 Even if you say that such cases are uncommon and can be differentiated by context, merging two different sounds in a single symbol in writing would only increase the difficulty of reading. You would for example not recommend using ‡§ï for all the five ‡§ï‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó letters.   

  

1.2 You have used ‡§ç and ‡§ë in non-standard ways. The common usage for these symbols is to write English words containing the sounds corresponding to the ‚Äòa‚Äô of cash and ‚Äòo‚Äô of office. (e.g. ‡§ï‡•Ö‡§∂, ‡§ë‡•û‡§ø‡§∏) and reusing the same symbols for nasalization would be confusing.    

  

1.3 You have removed dots from ‡•õ and ‡•ú in ‡§Ü‡§ú‡§º‡§Æ and ‡§ñ‡§°‡§º‡•Ä. A lot of native Hindi speakers don‚Äôt differentiate between j and z sounds in Hindi, so not using the dot under ‡§ú may be justifiable as a personal preference but almost all native Hindi speakers do differentiate between ‡§° and ‡•ú. It‚Äôs true that ‡§° and ‡•ú are allophones, so it should be possible to guess which one is intended from the context but what is the reason for removing a well-established distinction in the script? It will only make reading a little more difficult.  

  

1.4 Conjunct consonants involving a nasal have been rendered with ‡§®‡•ç even in cases of non-dental consonants, as in ‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§¨‡•Ä. This is an incorrect representation of the way people pronounce. When saying ‚Äò‡§™‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§¨‡•Ä‚Äô one does not slide the tongue from a ‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø position to a ‡§§‡§æ‡§≤‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø position. Similarly, nobody says ‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§ñ‡§æ when ‡§™‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§æ is intended. You may either write ‡§™‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§¨‡•Ä or ‡§™‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§¨‡•Ä since it is a well-established convention to replace the anusvara with the *corresponding* nasal sound in Hindi and many other Indian languages. Even Sanskrit admits it in some contexts (e.g. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ).  

  

1.5 You have removed anusvara from certain words such as ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç and ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç. This also goes against the spoken convention of most native Hindi speakers. We do differentiate between nasalized and non-nasalized vowels. ‡§ï‡§π‡•Ä and ‡§ï‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç have very different meanings. Saying ‚Äú‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§è‡§ó‡•Ä?‚Äù in place of ‚Äú‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§è‡§Å‡§ó‡•Ä?‚Äù can have quite a bit of social implication.

  

There is however a case for using chandrabindu in all places where a nasalized vowel is intended. The current standard practice is to replace it with anusvara wherever the vowel symbol extends above the shirorekha (‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§ñ‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§ö‡§®‡§æ can be unambiguously written as ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Å, ‡§ñ‡•Ä‡§Å‡§ö‡§®‡§æ). In fact the trend in the last few decades has been to completely do away with chandrabindu and use anusvara everywhere, which amounts to throwing away a useful feature. Now we cannot differentiate between ‡§π‡§Ç‡§∏ and ‡§π‡§Å‡§∏.   

  

1.6 You have used the Roman full stop instead of the Devanagari poorna virama. Devanagari has adopted many punctuation symbols from Roman script, but the poorna virama has a long and well- established usage as a marker of end of sentence or verse. What advantage do we get by replacing it with the Roman full stop?  

  

2. ‚Äú‚Ä¶to make spell checker free at greater extent .‚Äù   

Scripts should be made easy to read by humans first. Computers can always be made to suit the human scripts.   

  

3. ‚ÄúYou may hear nasal sound in a single word but not in a speech.‚Äù
  

This is not the case as already explained in 1.5.

  

4. **‚Äú**These newly added ‡§ç and ‡§ë sounds if studied carefully may reduce lots of nasal dots in Hindi.‚Äù  

These are not new symbols, but are being used for other purposes as explained in 1.2. 

What is motivation to reduce ‚Äúnasal dots‚Äù in Hindi?  

  

Regards
