Dear list members,  
I need pages 38 and 39 of  
महिषासुरमर्दिनीस्तोत्रम्  
Mahishasuramardini-stotram  
  
commentator:  
Dvadashadarshanakananakesari Acharya Swami  
Kashikananadagiriji Maharaj, Mahamadleswar.  
  
published by  
Bharati-Samskrta-Vidya-Niketanam  

  

If anyone has this book and could send me these two pages I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
