Hindus have the Bhagavadgītā, Muslims have the Quran, Sikhs the Guru Granth Sahib, and Christians, the Bible. In other words, a central text of their faith. But what about the Jains?

  

Jain Dharma is one of the oldest living religions in the world. It has flourished in India since the most ancient times and has had a deep and lasting influence upon the religious traditions, philosophy, literature, history, and culture of India. But until recently, there was no central text that was commonly accepted by all Jain traditions.

  

Vinoba Bhave, a preeminent leader of Modern India, requested Kṣullaka Jinendra Varni to prepare a text that authoritatively conveyed the key teachings of the Jain dharma that would be fully accepted by all Jains.

  

Accordingly, Jinendra Varni collated 756 Prakrit verses from the most ancient writings of the Jains, which were a true depiction of the sacred teachings of the Jinas.

  

The Samaṇa Suttaṃ is recognised as an authentic representation of Jain Dharma by the seniormost gurus and ācāryas of all Jain traditions.

  

Mahāmahopādhyāya Dayanand Bhargava, an antevāsī śiṣya of Kṣullaka Jinendra Varni and a profound Indologist and Sanskritist, has devoted his entire life to Sanskrit and Jain studies. This is his magnum opus.
