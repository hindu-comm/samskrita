Dear Piergiorgio,

Actually, the dhAtu is Nu (the mUrdhanya). It takes the form nu as  
given by the sutra (dhAtvAdeH) No naH.  
Its laT lakAra form is nauti.

And yes, pranava -> praNava is because of 'r'.

I don't know what "grammatical name of the root" etc. mean. I will let  
you figure out the mapping to those terms.
