That's right Sir Naresh, but the root is nu (Nu after previous r in pra,  
because of the known rule about retroflexing n into N; or maybe you meant  
the grammatical name of the root?). The verb is navate, I class (so, guNa  
degree of the root) or nuvate, VI class (weak degree) or nauti, I class  
(vRddhi degree) = to resound. No probable connection with the root an in  
aniti = to breathe.
