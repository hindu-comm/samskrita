Dear Naresh, I agree. What I have called the grammatical name of the roots  
is the name the Indian grammarians gave to verbal roots in order to classify  
them according to their different proprieties in conjugations, so called  
dhAtu, to which you refer correctly. For instance: the root majj (=to sink)  
is called "masjo"; the root div/dIv (=to play) is called "divu"; the root  
guh (=to hide) is called "guhU", and so on. So, you have informed me that  
the technical term of the root nu is Nu. These names have a technical  
meaning and purpose. They belong to the technical metalanguage invented and  
used by grammarians. In the language nu becomes Nu only after previous r .  
So (we can check on the dictionary, looking for nu) we get abhi-navate, but  
pra-Navate. Apart the language and the means used to describe them, the  
actual languague facts are still the same.  
Thanks, regards,
