Apologies - over the last three weeks I have been on a cruise ship, the Hurtigruten, going up the Norway coast to see the Northern Lights, so I have no access to Sanskrit texts or even internet. When I wrote my response I could not look it up but made a decision on my own understanding.  
Yes the root is nU and it conjugated like bhU, hence navati. When I tried to get the on-line MW dictionary I could not find the root but eventually I found it listed under nu. I will be back at my desk, on the 23 October.  
Apologies again  
Vimala
