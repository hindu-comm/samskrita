**Revisiting Lesson # 11 of Learning Sanskrit by fresh approach**

**What prompted revisiting ?**

Recently one Mr. B. Vishwanath sent me a message saying, "...

I have a request for you. I am a fan of the " learning Sanskrit by fresh approach" series. My mothertongueis Telugu and I find lot of similarities between Samskrit and Telugu. I am thinking that if the 'learning Sanskrit' series is available in Telugu also, it would be hugely beneficial to me and many other folks.

here is the request. Can I have theopportunityto convert/translate your lessons intoTelugu? I mean I would like to translate the explanation currently in English to Telugu. ...."

That reminded me to revive my postings of the lessons for Learning Sanskrit in Marathi medium, at another of my blog. Having posted 10 lessons there already, I had a re-look at Lesson # 11

As things would have it, Lesson #11 turned out to be having a long verse.

Anyway, it had to be done. The result was a complete overhaul of Section 2.  
  
The result of this "Revisiting Lesson # 11" is now posted at <http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com>
