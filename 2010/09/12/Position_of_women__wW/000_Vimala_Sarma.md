Dear Jaideep Mahodaya



The position of women is clearly demonstrated in our tradition from
earliest times, in the Vedas and upaniSads. The yajnas and rites are performed by the husband and wife together, the wife as an equal participant. (There are no injunctions about women not hearing the mantras, etc). From the earliest upaniSads (bRhadAranyaka), we have examples of women participating fully in philosophical debates as equals. We have good example of a strong woman in gArgI who is not intimidated by threats to back off from questions, but comes back with two more questions “with bow drawn”! We also have the example of a woman who is a servant who has lived in many houses and does not know the father or lineage of her son. She gives the boy her own name and her son is initiated in the sacred knowledge. Caste was not a concern.
Among the names of people who kept the Vedas, are feminine endings.
Later on in the time of kAlidAsa, proper dharma towards women was very important. See how sensitively he describes the plight of an abandoned pregnant woman and how roundly shakuntalA rebukes the King for his lack of morals. This is what dharma should be about (kindness, compassion, concern and respect for others and a sense of what is fair – the dharma of King shibi), in my own view, and not about observing caste rules.



There is no need to worry about defending the dharmasUtras or dharmasAstras. They represent a much later period when the caste system was made rigid, a low point in history. They brought down the position of women and it was even worse for the “shUdras”, an epithet we should no longer use. They caused lot of unhappiness unnecessarily. In a such long and diverse tradition over such a very long time period, as the Indian tradition, it is inevitable that not everything written is to be admired and people are bound to make mistakes and lapses in judgement.
We should not be too concerned about these.



Warm regards

Vimala
