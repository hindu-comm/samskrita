Hello All,

The discussion between Jaideep Mahoday and Vimala Mahodaya is very enlightening and I would like this to be continued in the public domain.People who are ignorant about history like me learn a lot of important references to be used when we are defending the greateness of he Indian Dharma while debating within our own circles.

Shouldn't debates always be like this in a temple / or a public place ? and isn't this mailing group our own Sanskrit temple ?
