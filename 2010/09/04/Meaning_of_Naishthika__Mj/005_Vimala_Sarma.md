Dear Piergiorgio

1. I am aware of the adjective function of the –ika but it is also “pertaining to” as well - see Whitney

2. The bv is below refers to the “niaSThika brahmacarin” phrase.
I did not say brahmacarin by itself is a bv – it is a tatpuruSa but I am suggesting the meaning is should be taken not by analysis of the members of the compound but as a separate different meaning.

Please have a another look at what I have said.

Best wishes

Vimala
