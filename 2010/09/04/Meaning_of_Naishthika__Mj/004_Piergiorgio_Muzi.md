Svasti, Mahodaye Vimale!

Since I am terribly pedant, I have to modify your careful analysis...just a little!

naiSThika is an adjective deriving after a noun, that is a taddhita, in traditional grammar. The noun is niSThA and the derivation is made by means vRddhi of the firs syllable and the suffix (pratyaya) -ika. The same as naiyAyika from nyAya, vaidika from veda, laukika from loka...

niSThati is the verb from which weget the nominalization (kRt-pratyaya) into niSThA. You gave the right composition of the verb from the upasarga ni- and theroot (dhAtu) sthA.

I musttell you that brahmacArin is not a bahuvrIhi compound,but a tatpuruSa,because it means cArin of Brahma, a person moving toward the study of Brahma (the common meaning, since referring to youth age of study and celibacy of Brahmans, is chaste and also brahmacarya means chastity/celibacy).

cArin is a -in derivative agent noun from carati. Usually this pratyaya refers to possessive (more or less strong) meaning, together with -mant,-vant, -vin (called svAmitvavAcaka) and is mainly used to form taddhita like yoga \> yogin, tapas \> tapasvin, kAma, kAmin..

At your disposal, best regards,

Piergiorgio.
