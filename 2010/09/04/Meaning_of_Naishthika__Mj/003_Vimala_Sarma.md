Dear Ramesh Mahodaya

More on niaSThika brahmacarin



ni + SThA + ka

Root SThA is stand but also fixed or established

ni - is prefix in this case means - into or in

ika is a suffix which makes the stem an adjective or it is like saying “pertaining to”; for example, vaidika – relating to the Vedas, but to add the ika suffix, the first vowel must be changed to a stronger grade – it will turn the first vowel - ni to nai (vRddhi form).

So we have naiStThika – so this will now mean “pertaining to being established in...........”.

brahmacarin - in this context means the Ashrama ie the state of being a Vedic student. After childhood a boy is supposed to become initiated (upanAyam) and become a student for about 12 years staying in the house of the teacher.

Note the -in suffix here which means possessing the quality or attribute; the root car is (move) but also the way one conducts oneself, but in this case the word is not to be analysed as a compound of separate components, but the whole compound has a separate meaning from its components – ie Vedic student or the stage of life of being such as student (of course the student is celibate).

So the whole phrase, niaSThika brahmacarin is now taken as a compound bahuvRhi – describing a person - “one who is established in the station of life relating to being a student”.
