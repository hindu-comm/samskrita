Dear Srivalli Ji  
praNava is pra prefix with root aN and suffix a  
The root is both class 1 parasmaida anuti, to sound, and class 4 atmanepada, aNyate, to breath. The pra prefix here has the sense of breathing out or breathing forth a sound. The final (a) suffix makes it a noun.  
Best wishes

\> Sirs,

I have a nagging doubt in my mind. During the course of studying the  
Maandukyopanishad , a birds view of the same, a thought has been coming to  
my mind. The Upanishad deals primarily with the suggestion that the Om Kara  
is infact the embodiment of everything in this world...and can be related to  
the Atman and so forth. The doubt that I have is that, Why should the word  
"PRANAVA" be associated with the Omkara?  
Can anyone explain the etymology of Pranava with respect to the Om kara?  
Should it be pra poorvaka nee dhaatoHo roopam ...i have no idea..  
Please help..

Srivalli Anand
