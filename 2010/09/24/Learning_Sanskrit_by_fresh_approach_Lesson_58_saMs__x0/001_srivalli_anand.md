Sirs,  
  
I have a nagging doubt in my mind. During the course of studying the Maandukyopanishad , a birds view of the same, a thought has been coming to my mind. The Upanishad deals primarily with the suggestion that the Om Kara is infact the embodiment of everything in this world...and can be related to the Atman and so forth. The doubt that I have is that, Why should the word "PRANAVA" be associated with the Omkara?  
Can anyone explain the etymology of Pranava with respect to the Om kara? Should it be pra poorvaka nee dhaatoHo roopam ...i have no idea..  
Please help..  
  
Srivalli Anand
