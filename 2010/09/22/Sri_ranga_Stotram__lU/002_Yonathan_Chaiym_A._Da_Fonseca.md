### *hbakshi Namaste*

***Clicking VIEW you can see the document but what happens is that sometimes the Google can not perform. What I do is to wait making, from time to time, several attempts. This also depends on certain type of formats. For this I always download the Sanskrit. But this specific document I tried with success before I answer this to you.  
Sincerely  
Yonathan
