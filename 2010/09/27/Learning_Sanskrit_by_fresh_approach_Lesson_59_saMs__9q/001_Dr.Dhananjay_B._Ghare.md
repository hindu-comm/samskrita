Dear Friends,  
 namaskaara.  
 The **Original request** (by any body who started this dialogue) seems to be :

  
 " I would like to know if  
 the **concerned poets or works could be identified**".  

 i.e. Name of the Poet like vyaasa, kaalidaasa etc. and Name of the Text like xyz_puraaNa adhyaaya n etc.  
  
 I agree that the Translations seem to be Scholastically done.  
 However, the **"Original_Source_Identification" is important** and the translation can be slightly different on the basis of  
   the **"Context"** in which the Verse is written by the Original Writer.  
  
 To me the original_text may be amongst works like **bhoja_kaalidaasa** or **similar works.**  
 If some body **identifies the "Original Texts"**, for these two verses (especially the first about **Lord gopaala**) please inform the group, as well as,  
  please mark a copy to my personal id **[dbg...@hotmail.com]()**  
  
 Thanking you in anticipation, and with regards and Best Wishes,  
 Dr.Ghare, Monday, Sept.27 2010, Portland, OR USA
