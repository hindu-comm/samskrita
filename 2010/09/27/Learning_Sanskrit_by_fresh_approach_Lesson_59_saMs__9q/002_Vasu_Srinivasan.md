I'm reposting this from the comments to the blog for wider audience:

  

abhyankara mahodaya

slokaarthaaya dhanyavAdah \|

i looked into Gita press edition of Bhagavata 10.39, I could not see this sloka (maa gaa:). Is there a different edition that refers this sloka?

Similar to Marathi “yeto”, Tamil (varen = i shall come or poittuvaren = i shall go and come), Kannada (bartheeni = i shall come), Malayalam and Telugu - all use same ideas. “I am going” is pretty much never used.

sayonara means “If it has to be that way”.

dhanyavAda:

vAsu
