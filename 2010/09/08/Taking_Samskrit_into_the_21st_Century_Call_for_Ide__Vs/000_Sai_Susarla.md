priya mitraaNi,  
As lovers of Samskrita bhaaShaa, many of us are concerned about the present plight of Samskrit education. We tend to ponder over issues concerning the future of Samskrit language pursuits: how to connect Samskrit with today's world, how to bring Samskrit back into the forefront of modern discourse, and what is the relevance of Samskrit to the future of mankind, and what can and should be done about it.  
  
If you have ideas along these lines that you'd like to put forward for discussion in front of policymakers in this field, an excellent opportunity has come up, as explained below. I request you to **send your constructive and actionable suggestions to me in the next few days**, so I can forward them to be raised at an upcoming meet in Delhi on Sunday September 12th to be attended by several luminaries in the fields of Samskrit and several management gurus.  
  
Read on below for details:

The **Samskrit Promotion Foundation** \[SPF\] has been conceived (a) to accelerate the renewed interest of India and the world in Samskrit as a tool to open the treasures of ancient knowledge and to handle modern technology and (b) to create and support a movement to Samskritise India again and, through Samskrit, revitalize and strengthen the Nation.

**Sri R. C. Lahoti, Former Chief Justice of India**, is the **Chairman** of the Foundation, **Justice** **Dr M. Rama Jois, Former Chief Justice and Governor** is the **Managing Trustee**.

SPF is working in association with Samskrit Universities, Academies, Foundations, Research Institutes, Central and State Government bodies and other likeminded voluntary organizations and individuals. The idea is that each and every Samskrit institution and Samskrit loving person should get involved in the coordinated effort of Samskrit promotion activities throughout the country and this effort should become a big movement.

Most of us are concerned with the present plight of Samskrit education, the issue of connecting Samskrit with today’s world, bringing Samskrit back to the forefront and like that. In this context, it is decided to hold a one day Seminar of the Vice Chancellors of Samskrit Universities and a few prominent Samskrit scholars on **12^(th) September, Sunday** in New Delhi to discuss the “**Possibilities and Opportunities for the Growth of Samskrit Universities & Other Institutions in the 21st Century**”. The details of the event are given below.  

*It is a matter of importance that **Justice R.C. Lahoti**, Former Chief Justice of India and **Sri N. Gopalaswamy**, Former Chief Election Commissioner, have kindly agreed to participate and guide the Seminar.*

I request you to contribute your ideas in crystallizing our strategies and agenda for the next 5 to 10 years.

Yours in the service of Samskrit and Samskriti,

  

(Chamu Krishna Shastry)

Secretary, Samskrit Promotion Foundation.
