Dear Prof. Muzi,  
I am ill-equipped to understand much of what you have written. I sent to you a reference to the NYT article, as by chance I happened to see it and not because it is my area of interest.  
I am a retired telecom engineer and technocrat and spend my time studying Sanskrit.  
Regards  
Murthy
