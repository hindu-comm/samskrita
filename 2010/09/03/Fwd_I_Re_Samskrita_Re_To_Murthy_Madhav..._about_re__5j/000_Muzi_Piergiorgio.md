\> Now, I am in Italy!  
\> I much appreciate your reflections.  
\> The grammatical and semantic cognitive intuitions and  
\> feelings of the speakers, above all the native speakers is  
\> fundamental for linguistics. The essay you sent is clearly  
\> referring to the so-called theory of Sapir-Whorf or  
\> "linguistic relativity". The author some tens years ago  
\> explained the importance of the world and life of any people  
\> to understand and explain their languages. Reciprocally we  
\> can realize that the lexicon and even the morphosyntactical  
\> structure of a language defines and limits the thought. A  
\> complementary aspect is the fact that we use every evolutes  
\> languages to deal with the same and the others languages.  
\> This is the universalistic attitude we can (I would-say) we  
\> must keep in linguistics. That was clearly the implicit  
\> sense of whichever philosophy of language, starting from  
\> Panini and Bhartrhari to modern generative and cognitive  
\> linguistics. The stress on relativity, both in the larger  
\> sense of Wittgenstein and in the weaker one  
\> of Sapir and Whorf, is not an absolute objection. Even to  
\> talk about the strong differences between languages we have  
\> to assume a universalistic attitude about human faculty of  
\> speech. Sapir and Whorf used the English language to have  
\> access and describe to languages of Hopi and other American  
\> cultures. They trusted in the universalistic power or the  
\> their language to reach this aim. We need a strong effort  
\> and self-consciousness when we try to understand the  
\> subtleties of foreign languages. This is also because the  
\> native speaker very often doesn't have a conscious knowledge  
\> of the rules he uses. I have realized that a lot of Italian  
\> teacher of their languages have a terribly confused explicit  
\> and logical knowledge of the rules they try to explain, for  
\> instance the so-called reflexive verbs, which in Italian,  
\> French, Spanish, Romanian, are used almost like Sanskrit  
\> Atmanepada, and also as reciprocal verbs...  
\> About the disappointing incompleteness of translation  
\> between languages, I agree with you. I can say that the  
\> partial failure to this could be kind of stimulus to  
\> understand better and better, even if we can't get a  
\> complete translation which mirrors what a writer or speaker  
\> of another language intends to mean and communicate, both  
\> cognitively and emotionally or aesthetically.  
\> Thanks a lot for your information about iteretaraM/d. If  
\> you find any other occurrences of it, please, let me know.
