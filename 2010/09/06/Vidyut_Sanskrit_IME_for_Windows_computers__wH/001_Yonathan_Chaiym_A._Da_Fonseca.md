***Namaste  
I have a Vista windows 7. Well, I download everything as the PDF document instructs but the font sanskrit 2003 does not appears to want activate. I know that I have it in my computer but does not appear in the Word and disappeared from the Baraha Pad.  
Can anyone tell how to solve this?  
I deeply thank you all  
Yonathan
