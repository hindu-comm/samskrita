Dear Sanskritists -  
We have just published a new Devanagari Sanskrit IME for Windows 32  
and 64-bit computers. We have tested it on WinXP, Vista and Windows 7.  
It is phonetically mapped to the U.S. QWERTY keyboard, thus the letter  
"M" is Sanskrit "ma" etc. Please check the following website for full  
documentation, installation instructions etc.

Any and all recommendations and comments are welcome.
