Priya Yonathan,

Happy to help!

If possible in your work it may help you to decrease the number of selectable keyboards. I do not know whether that is practical for you or not.

Speed hint: in Windows 7 you can hold down the left ALT key and press the SHIFT key to change rapidly among languages. In my case I use only three different keyboards, English, Polytonic Classical Greek and Sanskrit/Hindi.

Svasti,

VishNu Shaastrii
