***I deeply thank you Vishnu Shaastrii. What happened was that I completely forgot to right click on the font for to install it, I just did cut-paste to put in fonts at the Control-Panel.  
From all computers that I have no one is in English so, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Swedish as also other Scandinavian languages, Hebrew and some more. Deep focused about keys differences - normally the '?', when in Sanskrit, appears in SHIFT § (ie: ½), I completely forgot that to install the font was the key.  
N ow, there is this Hindi (Indien) that by some reason that I don't know always gets the priority above the Sanskrit (Indien). I would like to keep it but I begun feel tired about this supremacy :) I don't know if you or anyone of the Group has a solution for this. At the right side down all the languages are in order being at the top the Swedish (the main language of this machine), after the Portuguese (because of some diacritics that the Swedish has not), after I did put the English UK and after the English USA - well, I did this thinking that was the best but... for what? By pure instinct. So, is after this that appears the Vidyut Sanskrit (Indien). But the Hindi (Indien) that is down of all has, maybe because is Microsoft, even this way priority above the Sanskrit....  
Well, if this will troubles me I will uninstall the Hindi (Indien) of Microsoft.  
I renew my deep thanks  
Namaste  
Yonathan
