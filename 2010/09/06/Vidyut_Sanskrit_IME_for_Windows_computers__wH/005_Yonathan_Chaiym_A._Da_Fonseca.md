***Yes Dear Vishṇu Shāstrī, this laptop had too much different languages because of my researches and writings so, I only let here the Vidyut once that works exceptionally well, even much better than the Hindi from Microsoft. Anyway and for some years the others must remain, inclusive also the Greek - as you -, but I will dedicate my self observing the hypothesis of to use some of them only in the other computers but... is this one that I always have with me and above at all, at the university.  
Of course that all your observations are deeply welcome and for this I am thankful***  
***Sincerely yours  
Yonathan***
