Yonathan, have you downloaded and installed the Sanskrit 2003 font? To  
install new fonts in Windows 7 is easy; do the following:  
1. Right click on the downloaded font.  
2. Click INSTALL and it is installed.  
Next, you need to go to the Region and Language section of the Control  
Panel and select the Vidyut keyboard.  
To rapidly change from English (EN) to Sanskrit (SA) hold down the  
left ALT key and press SHIFT. This is a toggle function for switching  
back and forth.
