Dear Hans, of course, I agree with the suggestion of Eddie about the long research and study made by Kiparsky et alii in the field of synchronic general linguistics and its generative interpretation of Sanskrit grammar. Since the beginning this school worked in co-operation with computer science and formalization of natural languages. Ithink that it can match your interesting and difficult work. From my point of you, not been too much a follower of Chomsky, I would consider other points of view: above all not to forget the enormous and productive effort made by the eighteenth century's German and British philologists.

BTW, I have considered your issue about bhU/bhav. I don't believe that you need consider the change of the apophonic degree from weak (basal or zero) bhU to guNa (middle degree) bhav/bho as an application of vikaraNa. I would say vikaraNa for the application of the thematic vowel "a" to have bhav-a-ti. This vowel characterizes all the classes of 1st conjugation (bhuAdi, dIvAdi, tudAdi, curAdi). But some verbs of first and 6th class have the root in weak degree amplified with "cch": gacchati, yacchati, icchati, Rcchati, pRcchati. I would consider also this a vikaraNa which precedes "a", but I am not sure. About the definition ofthis suffix by meansofPanini's grammar terminology we'd better question pandit Abhyankar, who will certainly enlighten us. This suffixis the same you find much oftener in Old Greek andLatinand arrives through this language up to the modern western languages, including English (-ish, in finish, distinguish, perish...).This was originally sk gave an inchoative or intensive sense to the root.

Apart from this, how would youdefine the changeof the root by means ofnasal infix, n or na(sic>sincati;yuj>yunakti, yunjanti...)?. And what about theformation of a new stem by means of duplication (3rdclass, but also some verbs of 1st class: tiSThati, pibati, sIdati\<si-sdati...; and in perfect tense, as well as in desiderative and intensive secondary conjugation)?

Best wishes for your research!
