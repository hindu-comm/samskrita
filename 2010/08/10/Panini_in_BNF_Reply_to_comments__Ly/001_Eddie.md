Gentlemen,



Such a clarification of these grammatical elements is very much to be desired. Such glosses are there are, appear somewhat confused, not to mention,confusing.



In this matter, I have found Paul Kiparsky's paper *On the Architecture of Pāṇini's Grammar,* among the moreacceptable(**<http://www.stanford.edu/~kiparsky/Papers/hyderabad.pdf>*).*

His categorization of dhātu, prātipadika, pada etc., together with their 'basic' and 'derived' varieties, which he discuses side by side with the numbered sūtras, do makesense to me.



Would anyone like to proffer an opinion as tohow closely they (the English words)conforms with the Saṃskṛta.



Thanks,



 Eddie
