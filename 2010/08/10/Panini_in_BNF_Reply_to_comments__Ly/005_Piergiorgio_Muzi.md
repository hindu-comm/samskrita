Dear Hans, thanks for the clarification about vikaraNa. So, I suppose that's it needs to contain also reference to insertion of nasal (n or na). Do you think so?

I share your appreciation of Coulson's grammar (Teach Yourself Sanskrit). I have used it for about 5 years with my beginning students in Singapore. The only criticism I could do is aboutits notational system for sandhi and samAsa, a bit harsh...Two precious points in Coulson's:

1\) The sandhi of det. "sa", which is explained clearly thanks to reference to I.E. comparison (Old Greek, but we could add also Gothic sa, saa, thata).

2\) The clear explanation of the alternation an/a (e.g.Instr.S. brahman-aH / Instr.P. brahma-bhyaH; or han-ti / ha-taH, etc. as well for am/a..), due not to droppingof n or m, but to the historical development ofn or m,when a vowel, into a, like ar into R or o into u, etc.

If you like Coulson's, probably you would likemore Goldman & Goldman's DevavANIpraveshikA, which associatesthe vernacular Indian technical terms systematically and has a rich chapter about derivationsof nouns, etc.

BTW, you haven't used the common term taddhita, for pratyaya starting from prakRti, includingkRdanta, to form names or adjectives (subanta) called taddhitAnta, contrasting with kRdanta. According to Goldman, we shouldhave:

1\) dhAtu+ kRt-pratyaya> kRdanta

2\) prakRti (including both originalnAman and kRdanta)+ taddhita-pratyaya> taddhitAnta

3\) recursively, taddhitAnta+ taddhita-pratyaya>taddhitAnta

A note:It is very common the usage ofthe expression "past passive participle" or p.p.p.for shrutaH, mataH, gataH, jAtaH... (the same usage is in Latin, etc.). But this participle is passive only with a transitiveverb.mataH and shrutaH arepassive,but gataH is normally active (=who has gone). In this case there is no difference in meaning between gatavAn and gataH, while there is one between matavAn and mataH.

At last, I allow myself to remind you the existence of perfect participles; Atm. cakRvAn, Par. cakrANaH, not so common in classic Sanskrit, except for someverbs: vidvAn is common enough in philosophy.

I hope that I can be useful as well as yourreflections are useful to my study.

Namaste,

Piergiorgio
