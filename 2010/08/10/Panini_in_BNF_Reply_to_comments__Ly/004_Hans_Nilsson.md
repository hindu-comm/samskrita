Eddie,

Thanks for reminding me of Kiparsky’s Hyderabad paper. I read it some time ago, but it was a bit hard for me at that time. Now that I am deeper into Panini, I will really re-read it.



Glancing through it now, I found an interesting paragraph on vikaraNa, which relates to what Piergiorgio wrote here on the list the other day:



“BTW, I have considered your issue about bhU/bhav. I don't believe that you need consider the change of the apophonic degree from weak (basal or zero) bhU to guNa (middle degree) bhav/bho as an application of vikaraNa. I would say vikaraNa for the application of the thematic vowel "a" to have bhav-a-ti. This vowel characterizes all the classes of 1st conjugation (bhuAdi, dIvAdi, tudAdi, curAdi). But some verbs of first and 6th class have the root in weak degree amplified with "cch": gacchati, yacchati, icchati, Rcchati, pRcchati. I would consider also this a vikaraNa which precedes "a", but I am not sure”.



Kiparsky writes (on page 40):



“The *vikaraNas* bear grammatical markers which among other things have effect on the form of the rott, particularly on its accent and strong vs weak grade.”



So when I write the following definition:



\<tiṅanta \> ::= {\<upasarga>} \<dhātu> \<vikaraṇa> \<tiN>)



It means that (and the other entities) should not just be seen as a sequence of string, but a sequence of operators, that imply both string insertions AND operations on the preceeding string (anGa) like guna/vrddhi change.



Regards

Hans
