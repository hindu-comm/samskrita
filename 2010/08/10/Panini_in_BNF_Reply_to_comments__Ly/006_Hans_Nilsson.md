Dear Piergiorgi,



Thanks for your additional comments. Yes, I already have also Goldman&Goldman which is also very good. When I get stuck in one book, I switch to another and so on. I have too many books, and too little time to read… Maybe it’s time to re-read G&G again…



But I do use taddhita/taddhitanta in my BNF document. I am attaching the final version.



Kindest regards
