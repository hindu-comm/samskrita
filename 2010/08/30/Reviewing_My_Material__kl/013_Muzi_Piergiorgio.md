Dear Shri Dhananjay, just to confirm your exact and brilliant  
clarification of the semantics of Sanskrit demostrative pronouns, I’m  
sending these “cloka-s, of an anonymous Indian grammarian. They are quoted  
in Speijer’d Sanskrit Syntax (in this book there are also several examples  
of the difference between the four pronouns):  
idamaH pratyakSarUpaM samIpataravarti vaitado rUpam ;  
adasastu viprakRSTaM parokSe vijAnIyAt .  
इदमः प्रत्यक्षरूपं समीपतरवर्ति वैतदो रूपम्।

  
अदसस्तु विप्रकृष्टं तदिति परोक्षे विजानीयात्॥

We could deduct:  
idaM / tat = pratyakSa / paroksa = present / absent  
etat / adaH = samîpataravarti / viprakRSTa = nearer / remote

They seem to me to be very interesting for their clear and logical  
distinction by means of two contrasting criteria (respectively, presence  
and nearness). Of course the meaning of parokSa would need some detailed  
logical interpretation: it doesn’t mean that \<sa, sA, tat> presupposes the  
inexistence, but that it doesn’t presuppose the effective existence  
(visible, at hand or so)necessarily.  
Beginners will be struck by the genitive cases: idamaH, etadaH, adasaH. Of  
course they are not the genitive cases of idaM, etat, adaH, but the  
genitives of “idaM” , “etat”, “adaH”. That is, they are metalinguistic  
technical expressions invented by grammarians (in primis, Panini) in order  
to decline a quotation of a linguistic form, not the linguistic form  
itself as in use.  
Namaste!
