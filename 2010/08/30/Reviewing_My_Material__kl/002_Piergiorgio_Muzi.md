Hi, Yonathan,

there are two differences:

1\) ayaM is masculine; etad is neuter. So, it should be better to question about the difference between \<ayaM, imaM, idaM> and \<eSa, eSA, idaM>, each triplet being nominative: masc. fem. and neu. respectively of two different pronouns.

2\) both can be translated in English by "this"; but, even if sometimes they areinterchangeable, eSa tends to have an extreme degree of proximity (samIpatara) and ayaMtends to indicatepresence to senses (pratyakSa-rUpaM).

Best wishes,

Piergiorgio Muzi
