***Namaste  
I deeply thank you for your so splendid Spanish and French examples that clears everything to me because I can say that I have four mother languages instead of only one and all of this makes part: Hebrew, Portuguese, Spanish and French.  
This so vivid examples will permit me now never more forget this.  
I renew my thanks  
Sincerely  
Yonathan
