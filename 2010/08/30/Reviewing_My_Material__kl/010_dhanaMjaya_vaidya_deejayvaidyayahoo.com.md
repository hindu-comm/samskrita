Mostly in agreement with Shri. Muzi.  
  
etad (neuter)/eSha (mAsc)/eShA (fem) is for objects very close by. You  
might have the object held in your hand or be pointing to them.  
idam (neuter)/ayam (mAsc)/iyam (fem) is for objects in your presence  
but not quite at hand.  
  
You mention in your google profile that you speak French and Spanish.  
You would use etad in the sort of occasion you would use "voici" in  
French or "he aquí" in Spanish.  
You will remember that "Voici un livre" (etat pustakam \[properly:  
pashyaitat pustakam\]) means something more immediate than "Il y a un  
livre ici" (idam pustakam, properly: atra \[form of idam\] pustakam  
asti) in French.  
Or "He aquí un libro" means something more immediate than "Hay un  
libro aquí." in Spanish  
  
Also in some rural dialects of English, you have a point-to pronoun  
expression "This here book is my granpa's." where the book is in hand  
or pointed to, and the sense is different from "this book is my  
granpa's." where the book is only somewhere in the speaker's  
presence.  
  
This is just to dtiscuss that the need to distinguish something of  
great immediacy versus something that is generally present is not a  
strange and abstruse grammatical conceit only in Sanskrit. By  
reminding yourself how other languages also have grammatical cues to  
signal immediacy, you can get a sense when to use etad and when to use  
idam.  
  
saH/sA/tad do not imply presence.

Dhananjay
