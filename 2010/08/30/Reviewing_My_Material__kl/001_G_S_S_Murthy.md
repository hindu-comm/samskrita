There is a कारिका in this matter which goes as follows:  
इदमस्तु सन्निकृष्टं समीपतरवर्ति चैतदो रूपम् ।  
अदसस्तु विप्रकृष्टं तदिति परोक्षे विजानीयात् ॥  
When you want to speak of a thing nearby you are supposed to use इदम् (अयम्,इयम्,इदम्).When referring to a thing near enough but not too near(!) you are to use एतद् (एषः,एषा,एतत्). You use अदस् (असौ,असौ,अदः) when referring to something distant.  
Suffice it to say this rule is not strictly observed.
