***Yes, I am sorry, I did formulate badly this question. Well, I am understanding now and the question would be: being*** **एषः/सः *the masculine form,*** **एषा/सा** ***the feminine form and*** **एतत्/तत्** ***the neuter form, what difference in meaning exists between the anterior masculine form and*** **अयं  
*I deeply thank you for your so quick as precise answers, hopping you all understand my "conditionalisms" about a so evident thing. The true is that when my mind breaks it really breaks hahahahaha  
Deep thanks  
Yours  
Yonathan*
