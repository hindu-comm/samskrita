namo namaH yonathan varya



I understand the predicament because I am also in the same boat...

struggling alone and trying to make do with my own limited resources.



I may be completely wrong but my understanding is that ayaM and etat mean "this" with gender (linga) difference. ayam is punsak whereas etat isnapumsak .



hope this helps
