You are wrong indeed, sorry. They have different genders but they do not belong to the same pronoun. etat is the neuter of the pronoun \<eSa, eSA, etat>, while ayaM is themasculin of \<ayaM, iyaM, idaM>. In my email I tried to explain the strong similarities and the subtle differencesin their meaning. Translation in English is often "this" forboth.{read: \<masc., fem., neu> }

Best wishes,

Piergiorgio Muzi
