Bharatia Vidhya Bhavan has its Sanskrit courses and conducts regular exams. Unfortunately this is not available in the US. The one hope I've is at some time, these kind of structured programs with its testing process would be available to people like me who are not in NY City and not in India. At some point I want to be able to find out where I am in the learning process -- an I in Kinder Garten or in 1st grade? What do I do to get to 2nd Grade and the next steps in the Sanskrit learning process?

  

  
Thanks & Regards
