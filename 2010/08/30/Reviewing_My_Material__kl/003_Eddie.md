Yonathan,



ayam and etat are indeed different of gender.And Coulson makes further subtle distinctions, thatcan considerably overlap.



However, ayam is often used asthedemonstrative pronoun, while etad is the usual pronoun.





*This* (etad)sentence is an example of the use of this as a pronoun.



But*this*(ayam) one,employsthedemonstrative variety.





Eddie,





**demonstrative pronoun**

4\. *Gram.* indicating or singling out the thing referred to. *This* is a demonstrative pronoun.
