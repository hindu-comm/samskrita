Namaste.  
When you go to Sapna Book house, Landmark or any bookstore , please ask for Sanskrit books. Let the bookstall owner feel that there is a great demand for Sanskrit books.  
Sanskrit propagation at no cost -:) and if many people ask, who knows the guy might stack it.  
He is a business man and he just wants to procure wealth. Let him do it by serving the cause of Sanskrit.  
  
Besides Vedanta Bookhouse in Bull temple road, there is Vandana Book house in N.R.Colony , Motilal Banarasidas in fourth block- Jayanagar-Shopping complex , Gitapress bookstall in a platform in Bangalore Central railway station and ofcourse Samskrita Bharati,'Aksharam'
