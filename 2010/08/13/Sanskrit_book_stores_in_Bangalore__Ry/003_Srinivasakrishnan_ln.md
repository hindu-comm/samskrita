Vedanta Book store is not on Bull Temple Road but on a smaller road. The address is given below. It's beside Uma Talkies - that's still the best identification. It's arguably the best Sanskrit bookstore in the south. Also, the people are rather friendly.



The store that's on the road beside Uma Talkies is the Puja, sahasranama, agarbatti type book store. Behind in the lane is the bigger store which has all the Sanskrit kavya, alankara, vedanta, nyaya, vyakarana books. The pleasant surprise about this store is there's plenty of space so you can sit down and browsebefore deciding to buy a book.

  
Also, they have plenty of those recent publications from Delhi,Haryana, Varanasi etc which are meant for Hindi speakingstudents. Arguably some of these books are much better than the outdated British period books in English. They also have plenty of books for Kannada speaking students.



One thing you may want to think about; if you want them to mail books to you. Please weigh the books and pay themthe postage charges and make sure that you leave a phone number for them to contact you in case the postage is not, for some reason, adequate.
