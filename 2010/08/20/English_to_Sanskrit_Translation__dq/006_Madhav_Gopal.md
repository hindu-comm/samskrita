My humble opinion on this issue:



I think, for Sanskritto be more suitable and acceptable in the contemporary times, weshouldattach the sup pratyayas in the foreign words directly, though some times after Sanskritizing them mildly. Thiswould be more natural from linguistic point of view. To attach बाला, कुमार, महोदय, महोदया in foreign names is to show the inability of Sanskritto capture themodern reality ofa multicultural society, though we can very well use them, legitimately, when we wish to encode honorificity (but all the time honorificity we don't need).I don't think any otherlanguage does this. These words (some of them) are honorific and they should not be misused.In the example given here, John has been mildly Sanskritized, that is, an अ has been attached at the end of जॉन् and it becomes जॉन, then we can inflect it like any masculine अकारान्त word of Sanskrit, say, राम. In case of Monica no Sanskritization is needed and it will inflect like आकारान्त स्त्रीलिङ्ग word रमा.



John spoke to Monika = जॉनः मोनिकाम् अवदत्।



This should be considered the perfect Sanskrit sentence and the translation of the given English sentence. This is more economic and vast in use. To say जॉनमहोदय when John is my domestic help is infelicitous. In such cases John should be जॉनः only.जॉनमहोदय could be fine when John is my professor.



Thank you.

With regards,

Madhav

Thank you very much Abhyankar Mahoday for your kind help. I regret that these sentences were not interesting for you, but for me they are very precious and for translating them in Sanskrit, I am grateful to you from my bottom of my heart.
