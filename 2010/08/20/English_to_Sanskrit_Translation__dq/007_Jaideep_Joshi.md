Namaste,  
  
I had some sentences for which I cannot think of a Sanskrit equivalent (within scope of my meagre knowledge).  
  
Please tell the translations for these, in particular, what vibhakti is to be used for the bold nouns:  
Preferably, avoid verbs which do not appear in the english sentences.  
  
1) Bring him **to me**.  
2) Hey **you**!  
3) I will approach the director **through you**.  
4) there is no gold or wealth **with me**.  
5) he did enquiry **about me**. (use विचारणं कृतवान् )  
6) he enquired about  
7) fruit is obtained in **6 months** / by **6th month**.  
8) namaskaars done to **all gods** reach govinda. (translate as prose only)  
9) he has gone beyond **reason**. (using परत: and अति for beyond)  
  
Pranaamns,  
Jaideep
