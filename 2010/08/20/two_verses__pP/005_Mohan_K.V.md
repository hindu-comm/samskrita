Thank you GSS, that was very helpful. I was confused by the "सम्भाव्यते वा न वा" in the first one, but I understand now. And about the second one, I'm guessing the last line is spoken in a tone of mock surprise, as if it is a miracle for a man to (be able to) live without his beloved during the monsoons.
