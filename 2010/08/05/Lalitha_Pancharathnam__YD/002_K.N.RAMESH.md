Lalita Pancharatnam Stotra Lyrics  
  
Pratha smarami Lalitha vadanaravindam,  
Bimbadaram pradhula maukthika shobhi nasam,  
Aakarna deerga nayanam mani kundaladyam,  
Mandasmitham mruga madojjwala phala desam. 1  
  
Prathar Bhajami Lalitha Bhuja kalpa vallim,  
Rathnanguleeya lasathanguli pallavadyam,  
Manikhya hema valayangadha Shobha maanam,  
Pundreshu Chapa kusumeshu sruneen dadhanam. 2  
  
Prathar namami lalitha charanaravindam,  
Bhakteshta dana niratham bhava sindhu potham,  
Padmasanadhi sura nayaka poojaneeyam,  
Padmangusa dwaja sudarsana lanchanadyam. 3  
  
Pratha sthuthave parasivaam lalithaam bhvaneem,  
Trayyanha vedhya vibhavam karunanan vadhyam,  
Viswasya srushti vilaya sthithi hethu bhootham,  
Visweswareem nigama vang mana sathi dhooram. 4  
  
Prathar vadami lalithe thava punya nama,  
Kameswarethi, kamalethi Maheswareethi,  
Sri shambhaveethi jagatham janani parethi,  
Vag deva thethi vachasa tripureswareethi. 5  
  
Ya sloka panchakam idham, Lalithambikya,  
Soubhagyuam, sulalitham patathi prabhathe,  
Thasmai dadathi lalitha jadithi prasanna,  
Vidhyaam sriyam vimala soukha manantha keerthim.



At dawn I remember Sri Lalita Devi That One whose Face is a Lotus

Her Lips are as red as the Pomegranite Flower

A large pearl pendant enhances the beauty of Her Nose

And Her Lovely Large Eyes span Ear to jeweled Ear

Ever subtly smiling

Her Forehead glows with a mark of intoxicating musk

(end of verse/stanza 1)

    Verse 2 of 5 Om Each morning I prayerfully sing in praise of the
    Wish-fulfilling Vine-like Arms of Sri Lalita Whose Fingers like the
    tender new leaves are set with precious red gems She glitters with
    gold and diamond-studded arm bracelets and bears a white sugarcane
    bow, flowered arrows, and a goad (end of verse /stanza 2)

    verse 3 of 5 Om I offer Salutations each morning to the Lotus Feet
    of Sri Lalita Devi Which always grant the devotees' desires and are
    the boat that crosses samsara Those Sacred Feet worthy of worship by
    Brahma and All Foremost Deities Decorated by the auspicious lotus
    goad flag and the divine discuss (end of verse/stanza 3)

    Verse 4 of 5. Om I sing at Dawn to that Sri Lalita Devi the Supreme

    scriptures, speech, mind and intellect (end of verse/stanza 4)

    

    

    Verse 5 of 5. Om Oh Sri Lalita I chant repeatedly at Dawn Your
    Sacred and Auspicious Names: Kameshwari Kamala Maheshwari Sri
    Shambavi Mother of the Worlds The Supreme Deity Goddess of Speach
    Knowledge and All the Ruling Triple Deities (end of verse 5) Fruit
    of Recitation: whoever sings at dawn these verses in praise of Sri
    Lalita Devi, these verses grant the highestgoodfortune,are blessed
    by the Grace of Sri Lalita with higher knowledge prosperity
    happiness & unending fame
