Dear Anil Mahodaya



The mAnu smRti is definitely extant an there is a critical version translated by Olivelle.

But I think it is no longer in use for political reasons – because it says things like women should never be independent and cannot even hear Vedas let alone recite it. Even when the poor woman is dead the ceremonies should be done without recitation (just in case her Atman hears it, I suppose). Also it not in tune with democracy, as it puts Brahmins on top of everything and everyone else, and penalties for harming Brahmins are very severe, but no so for other castes. The food injunctions also are very confusing and it permits killing for religious rituals (it says here killing is not killing). For all these reasons people no longer refer to it as a text for the practice of dharma.



Warm regards

Vimala
