As far as I had read, Manusmriti advocates stricter punishments for brahmins than shudras for the same crime in many cases, probably since they are the ones least expected to commit these crimes. (Of course, it is not necessary that each and every thing given in Manusmriti must be accepted, and by the very definition of Smriti, it is only valid in the given time, and must change as times change)  

  
I am attaching a document presented to the Rajasthan High Court when a decision was being made to remove the statue of Manu installed in the Jaipur premises. It gives a lot of examples to show that the rampant criticism of Manusmriti by western translators is not justified to that extent. (pdf file is attached in 3 parts in 3 separate mails to accommodate size.)  
  
But such matters are so confusing that one cannot really prove or disprove the other's point without (and sometimes, even after) critical study. Has anyone personally verified the translations (and interpretations) of Manusmriti, in light of the time during which it was applicable? If so, I would be very glad to know their opinion on this matter.  
  
Pranams,
