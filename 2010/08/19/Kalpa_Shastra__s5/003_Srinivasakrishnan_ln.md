\>Vedanta philosophy usually only refers to Advaita, so it is not synonymous with

\>philosophy in general. Advaita should be added to the darshanas.

  

In my view, the statement at the site saying 'Upaniṣads are called Vedānta' is substantially correct. You can see Kalidāsa using it like that, and some medieval writers as well as modern writers on Indian philosophy (usually Indian).

  

\>Vedanta philosophy usually only refers to Advaita

  

This is probably not quite correct. One can see writers refering to advaita vedānta, viśiṣṭādvaita vedānta, dvaita vedānta etc . However the notion that there's only one school of Indian vedanta called Advaita is quite common among lay people, especially urban English speaking people of India and the NRI's. This is what prompted Swami Agehananda Bharati to remark that it is the Advaitin's pet delusion he must punch the ticket on the last flight (to Nirvana).

  

Hope this helps,
