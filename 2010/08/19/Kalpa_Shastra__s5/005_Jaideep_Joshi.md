Namaste,  
  
I believe you are saying that Advaita Vedanta is a later development as it is associated with Adi Shankaracharya. But He did not *invent* the Advaita system, but he is its greatest propounder. The system itself is much older.  
  
Also, I get one doubt here. The time of Adi Shankaracharya is very disputed. Some say it is BC 501 (with strong arguments), while some say it is \~ AD 800. Can someone throw some light on this?  
  
Pranams,
