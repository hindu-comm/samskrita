It has become a tradition for Indians to accept whatever translation is present by whoever scholars, qualified or not. The lack of knowledge of Sanskrita language by Indians, lack of Indian scholarship and acceptance of translations done 100 years ago have contributed to this state. And applying today's laws to yesterday's society is not scholarly.  
  
If we really want to understand manusmriti, two things are required:  
  
- learn sanskrita and read the smriti  
- understand the context of when this was done  
  
While anybody can be a critic of manusmriti, take a look at one close to the land -- Kanchi Paramacharya's "Deivatthin kural" (Voice of God) goes into good detail about setting the context of manusmriti. For eg, he has mentioned the exact contrary: that Brahmana's have stricter punishments because they are more educated to know the difference between right and wrong.
