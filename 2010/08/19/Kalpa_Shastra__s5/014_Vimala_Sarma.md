Dear Friends

I have been mis-understood. When I said critical edition – I meant in the scholarly sense. Olivelle looked at different version and came up with what is called the “critical’ edition with notes. I do not mean he was critical. Olivelle reads Sanskrit (he is in fact an excellent scholar) and the sanskrit source as well as the translation given. I myself have read the sanskrit text though I am not at all knowledgeable. I was only reporting what is actually in the text, for all to read. Please don’t shoot the messenger!

Perhaps we should end this topic!
