Thanks for visiting the site and the words of encouragement.  
1.Vedas are considered to be revealed texts(Sruti) with no author and  
transmitted orally by Rishis.  
2.Advaita siddhanta is a much later development(8th century AD) than  
the six Darshanas. Vedanta(Upanishads) marks the transition to  
Philosophy from Ritualistic practice and hence is used to refer to  
Philosophy.  
3.It is the accepted practice to call Ramayana and Mahabharata as  
Epics though Itihasa means history.  
4.Regarding Manava Dharma Sutra, I need to check and include on  
verification.Thanks.  
Regards,  
Anil Kumar
