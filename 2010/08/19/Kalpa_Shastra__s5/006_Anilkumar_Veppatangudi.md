Pranam Shri.Joshi,

That's right. The proponent of Advaita is said to be Gaudapada who was the guru of Govinda Bhagavatpada who in turn was the guru of Adi Shankara who developed it further to make it well known.

Though there are many suggestions that Shankara's period was earlier to 8th Century AD, I think it is the historians' point of view that it was indeed the 8th Century.

Regards,

Anil kumar
