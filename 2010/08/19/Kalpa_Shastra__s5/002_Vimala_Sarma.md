Dear Anil

Site is very well laid out.

MAnava DharmasUtra needs to be added.

I also thought the veda’s did not have an author.

All the saMhita text in Vedas minus brahmaNas, AraNyakas, upaniSads are termed mantras. All four types of texts are shruti.

The 13 upanisads you listed are the oldest ones and thought to be written very early (by about 500 BC).

Vedanta philosophy usually only refers to Advaita, so it is not synonymous with philosophy in general. Advaita should be added to the darshanas.

I am not equipped to make any comments on other aspects.

ItihAs means history so I am not sure if this correct term for the epics, since these are not strictly historical.

It is very good site. It is a very ambitious project.

Keep up the good work!

Vimala
