Dear Prof. Muzi,

Let me at the outset express my regret if my expressions have caused anguish, pain or hurt to the scholars participating in this discussion. You have done me an honour by writing to me.

I only conveyed my views and beliefs. My views will be MINE and my beliefs will be MINE. Nobody need agree with what I say and my beliefs could be ill-founded. I am always subject to correction. All that I wanted to convey was that usage determines the language.

I based my belief that इतरेतर does not imply reciprocity by the usage, “इतरेतरद्वन्द्व”, where reciprocity I believe does not come into picture. After receiving your Email, I have looked up further and I have come across the following usage which implies reciprocity.

इतरेतरानभिभवेन मृगास्तमुपासते गुरुमिवान्तसदः ॥ किरातार्जुनीयम्- ६-३४ ॥

लब्धसौरवगुणो मदिराणामङ्गनास्यचषकस्य च गन्धः ।

मोदितालिरितरेतरयोगादन्यतामभजतातिशयं नु ॥ शिशुपालवधम् १०-२४ ॥

and

इतरेतरसन्निकर्षजन्मा फलसंघट्टविकीर्णविस्फुलिङ्गः ॥ शिशुपालवधम् २०-२६ ॥

Therefore I stand corrected. अन्योन्य, परस्पर, इतरेतर seem to mean the same thing.

Lat me hazard to share my view in respect of Sanskrit. As most of Sanskrit literature that has survived is in the form of verses, liberties associated with poetry permit poets to stretch or alter the meaning to suit the context. वाचमर्थोऽनुधावति.

Let me again emphasize that I am not a scholar of Sanskrit.

BTW have you had a look at this?
