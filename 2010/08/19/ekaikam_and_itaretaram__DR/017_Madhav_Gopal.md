Dear Prof. Muzi,



Thanks for your explanaton/interpretation in this issue. I think ekaika has some degree of reciprocity. There are contexts where it could be only reciprocal, though Speijer has not enumerated it among reciprocals. Please consider this example:



The boxes are stacked on top of each other \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> पेटिकाः एकैकोपरि रचिताः सन्ति ।



Here the use of ekaika conveys the sense of "each other" in English, which is undoubtedly reciprocal. Please analyse this exapmle.



By the way, you are involved in very interesting issue of linguistics and a lot of people would be interested in it. I will discuss it with my friends.



Therewould bemany books available on this aspect of language, which you might be knowing already. Here are some references which could be of your use:



1\) J.K. Gundel at el. 1993, Cognitive status and and the form of referring exprssions in discourse. *Language*, 69(2):274-307.

2\) ------------------------ 2003. Cognitive status, information structure, and pronominal reference to clausally introduced entities. Journal of logic, Language and Information, 12:281-299.

3\) M. Hegarty. 2003. Semantic types of abstract entities. Lingua, 113:891-927.

4\) H. Alshawi, *Memory and context for language interpretation*, Cambridge:CUP.

5\) N. Dahlback, Representation of discourse: cognitive and computational aspects (1991), PhD thesis, Linkoping University, Sweden.



You are an expert on the subject and you know all these things. For, the rest ofthe things i will contact you sooner.



Regards and thanks,

Madhav
