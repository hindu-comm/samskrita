Dear Dhananjay Mahodaya,



"The "boxes stacked one on the other" example does not seem reciprocal even in English."



Please don't distort the example. It is given here again. Kindly tell us why it is not reciprocal at least in English. The truth condition of the sentencecan also be taken into account.



The boxes are stacked on top of each other \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> पेटिकाः एकैकोपरि रचिताः सन्ति ।



"If the first box is stacked on top of the second box, then the second box is not stacked over the first box - it is UNDER the first box. There does not appear to be reciprocity."



In the example and in the context where it could be uttered there is no specification, which box is stacked on which box. If you put your second box over the first box, still the sentence remains true.



When speaker of English, Sanskrit or any other language speak these kind of senteces they don't perceive the world as you are analyzing here by distorting that example. In these kind of sentences reciprocity resides in the perception of the speakers not in the real world.



Please think about a context where there are six boxes lying on the ground and a person asks you, "Please put these boxes on each other."



Here you will deny to the requst by saying "I cannot put the boxes on each other" or complying it you will put the boxes vertically.



Another example of Sanskrit:



**रामः श्यामःच एकैकम् पश्यतः \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Ram andShyamare seeing each other.**



Here please support or refute the existance of reciprocity. Prof Muzi is also requested to give his comment.



Thank you,

With regards,

Madhav
