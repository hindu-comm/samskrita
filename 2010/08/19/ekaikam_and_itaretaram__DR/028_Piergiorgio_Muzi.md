Now, I am in Italy!

I much appreciate your reflections.

Thegrammatical and semanticcognitive intuitions and feelings of thespeakers, above all the native speakers is fundamental for linguistics. The essay you sent is clearly referring to the so-called theory of Sapir-Whorf or "linguistic relativity". The author some tens years ago explained the importance of theworld and life of any people to understand and explain their languages. Reciprocally we can realize that thelexicon and even the morphosyntactical structure of a language defines and limits the thought.A complementary aspect is the fact that we use every evolutes languages to deal with the same and the others languages. This is the universalistic attitude we can (I would-say) we mustkeep in linguistics. That was clearly the implicit sense of whicheverphilosophy of language, starting from Panini andBhartrhari to modern generative and cognitive linguistics. The stress on relativity, both in the larger sense of Wittgenstein and in weaker one of Sapir and Whorf,is notan absolute objection. Even to talk about the strong differences among languages we have assume a universalistic attitude about human faculty of speech. Sapir and Whorf used the English language to have access to languages of Hopi and other American cultures. They trusted in the universalistic power or thetheir language to reach the aim.We need a strong effort and self-consciousness when we try to understand the subtleties of foreign languages.This is also because the native speaker very often doesn't have a conscious knowledge of the rules he uses. I have realized that a lotof Italian teacher of their languages have a terribly confused explicit and logical knowledge of the rules they try to explain,for instance the so-called reflexive verbs, which in Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, are used almost like Sanskrit Atmanepada, and also as reciprocal verbs...

About the disappointingincompleteness oftranslation between languages, I agree with you. I can say that the partial failure to this could bekind of stimulus to understand better and better, even if we can't get a complete translation which mirrorswhat a writer or speaker of another languageintends to mean and communicate, both cognitively and emotionally or aesthetically.

Thanks a lotfor your information about iteretaraM/d.If you find any other occurrence of it, please, let me know.

Regards,

Piergiorgio Muzi
