Thanks, dear Vimala, this is very interesting! Supposedly, this is connected to the concept of dvandva (couple), which is originally dual, even if as a matter of fact the composition is often multiple. Can you find any other case of this extension? On the other side,as forthe examples I took from Speijer's, anyonya and paraspara can be used also for a single couple. For instance (Vikram. I ): anyonyaM hastaM spRshataH = they (two) shake hands. So, it is possible that no difference is in the usage between anyonya, paraspara and itaretara. 

Regards,

Piergiorgio
