I apologize if it appears that I am distorting the example.  

  
\> "The "boxes stacked one on the other" example does not seem reciprocal even  
\> in English."  
  

I was taking this to be a gloss of "एकैकम्" i.e., one-on-one. Such  
usage is not idiomatic in English.  
"one on another" is reciprocal in English, I agree. On the other hand  
"एकपरम्" which would be a saMskRta gloss for the idiomatic English  
term would not be idiomatic.  
  
In "one another" there is temporary grammatical specification. First  
"one" is mentioned. Then "another", meaning "other than the one" is  
mentioned. To determine which is the "other", the specification of  
which is the "one" has to persist in the memory. The fact that such  
temporary specification and temporary reverse specification occurs has  
been discussed by the saMskRta grammarian nAgesha in his  
paramalaghuma\~jUShA, chapter regarding apAdAna, discussion regarding  
"अजौ परस्पराद् अपसरतः ". If this issue is of interest to you, perhaps  
nAgesha has explained this concept better than me - please see his  
writing directly.  
  
There is also several other grammarians, whose thoughts may interest  
you. The व्याकरणमहाभाष्य has a detailed discussion of reciprocity in  
the description of the sUtra 1.3.14. काशिकावृत्ति has a one-sentence  
definition of reciprocity in the description of the sUtra 1.3.14 :  
यत्रान्यसम्बन्धिनीं क्रियामन्यः करोति, इतरसम्बन्धिनीं चेतरः, स  
कर्मव्यतिहारः ।  
Commentaries of the काशिकावृत्ति , e.g., जिनेन्द्रबुद्धि's न्यास and  
हरदत्त मिश्र's पदमञ्जिरी both explain this concept in somewhat greater  
detail.  

  
\> When speaker of English, Sanskrit or any other language speak these kind of  
\> senteces they don't perceive the world as you are analyzing here by  
\> distorting that example. In these kind of sentences reciprocity resides in  
\> the perception of the speakers not in the real world.  

OK. If someone is counting votes of bona fide perceivers, please make  
a note that I do not perceive reciprocity in "एकैकम्".  
  
\> \*रामः श्यामः च एकैकम् पश्यतः \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Ram and Shyam are seeing each  
\> other.\*  
Could you please give me the reference if this sentence was spoken/  
written by a native saMskRta speaker? The sentence sounds incorrect to  
me. However, I am not a native saMskRta speaker. (My presumption is  
that you are not a native saMskRta speaker either, and I apologize if  
this presumption is incorrect.) I will gladly accept एकैकम् as  
reciprocal in meaning if I find that meaning used by native saMskRta  
writers. (Of course, writers whose primary educational language was  
saMskRta, e.g. Kalidasa, are also acceptable. Probably someone with  
strong secondary knowledge such as Jayadeva would also be acceptable.  
Native speakers from mattUru are acceptable, if the generalization is  
restricted to their own regional dialect of saMskRta, which appears to  
be influenced by kannaDa.)  
  
Regards and apologies,  
Dhananjay
