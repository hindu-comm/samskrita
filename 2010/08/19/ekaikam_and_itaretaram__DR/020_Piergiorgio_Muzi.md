Dear Madhav, yes, I agree with you about some syntactically reciprocal structures, which are not such from a semantic point of view, like in the examples of boxes. As for the example of RAma and SItA, I am a bit perplexed. Given the standard distributive sense of the duplication, it may refers to distinction, more than meeting, of their looks. Possibly, in spite of theexplicit standard rule referred by Speijer, starting from limit cases a non-reciprocal expression could be used to give a particularfeeling to a reciprocity situation. This would be the contrary case of the ...English boxes!We must add that the concept of reciprocity is a bit fuzzy. Consider: In that country they respect each other. It has a privileged meaning that in each couple ofthat country thereis reciprocal respect. In the extreme opposite case: In that country they kill each other. Probably there is no couple who commits reciprocal murder!

Also the intentionality of the reciprocity is concerned sometimes. A full reciprocity is intentional, a weak reciprocity is a casual coincidence or convergence of two identical or similar attitudes...And the empathy attitude of the reporter... Different languages can express those aspects in different ways, respectively...

Best wishes,

Piergiorgio
