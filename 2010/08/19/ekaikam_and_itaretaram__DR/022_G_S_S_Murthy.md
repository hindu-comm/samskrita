Dear all,  
I am not a linguist and not a Sanskrit scholar either. The discussion going on appears to me too academic if not pedantic. Perhaps it is bound to be academic if academics are interacting.  
I believe : Nuances of a language are best learnt through usage and not through trying to translate from another language. Each language has its own limitations when it comes to expressing what is given in another language, that too when the two languages are disparate.  
I believe that अन्योन्य and परस्पर are interchangeable and imply reciprocity. इतरेतरत् does not imply.  
Valmiki uses परस्परम्  with great effect :  
परस्परं केचिदुपाश्रयन्ति परस्परं केचिदभिद्रुवन्ति ।  
Again use of अन्य here:  
गायन्तमन्यः प्रहसन्नुपैति हसन्तमन्यः प्ररुदन्नुपैति।  
तुन्तमन्यः प्रणुदन्नुपैति समाकुलं तत्कपिसैन्यमासीत् ॥  
Both occur in 61st canto of Sundarakanda.  
Regards to all  
Murthy
