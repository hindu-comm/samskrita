Interesting discussion by all.

The सूत्र/वार्तिक as mentioned in the काशिकावृत्ति only mention the  
following as reciprocals इतरेतर अन्योन्य परस्पर. It appears that the  
writer of the वार्तिक looked for other words and found no others. I am  
inclined to agree with Shri. Muzi that एकैक does not have a reciprocal  
meaning. The "boxes stacked one on the other" example does not seem  
reciprocal even in English. If the first box is stacked on top of the  
second box, then the second box is not stacked over the first box - it  
is UNDER the first box. There does not appear to be reciprocity.

Note to Shri. Sharma : इतरेतर in the term इतरेतरद्वन्द्व is reciprocal  
in meaning. In the वृत्ति for the द्वन्द्व सूत्र, the  
लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी describes the meaning of समुच्चय and इतरेतर as  
follows :  
समुच्चय - परस्पर-निरपेक्षस्य अनेकस्य एकस्मिन् अन्वयः \| (unrelated  
entities relating to a single \[other\] entity)  
The example given is :  
ईश्वरं गुरुं च भजस्व (here द्वन्द्व does not take place)

However :  
इतरेतरयोग - मिलितानाम् अन्वयः  
The example given is :  
धवखदिरौ छिन्धि ।  
Thus, even in this context, इतरेतर means "one related to the other"

Note that in इतरेतर the meaning is not "taken together as one group",  
i.e., समाहार

The relation to one another is essential because समास can only take  
place when words are related to each other either as equals or  
unequals.

\- - -  
Separate issue:  
I am curious as to know further information about shri. Muzi's  
investigation into 4th-class verb-roots. I cannot quickly guess any  
semantic meaning-class connection from the examples I looked at :  
दीव्यति सीव्यति नृत्यति ... नश्यते जायते विद्यते ...  
competes, sews, dances ... falls-apart, comes-to-birth, exists...  
(At least they don't all appear to be psychological perceptual/  
cognitive as मन्यते (believes or considers)

However, I am inclined to believe that there may be a semantic class  
characteristic. I look forward to hearing more.
