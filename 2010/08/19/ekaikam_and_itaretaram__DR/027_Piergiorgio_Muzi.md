Dear Mr Murthy,

Sorry! I was just kidding about the real pedantry of linguists and psycholinguistics. I will consider seriously your proposals and I will reply as soon as I will be in Italy (now I am in Taipei this week. BTW, my questions were real, too, sincethere are quite important problems in this field, I'm thinking about. Recently I read a study about reciprocal constructions in Vedic. I will tell you my opinion about that.

अभिबाधका मनोभाषाविज्ञानिनः। परस्परं अपिमनोभाषाविज्ञानिनो ऽतिसंबाधन्ते मन्ये।

Thanks a lot and best regards,

Piergiorgio Muzi
