Dear Madhav, your issue about itaretara, etc. is worthy of logical analysis. We have to distinguish the reciprocal pronouns (RP) like paraspapara, anyonya and itaretara from the repeated numerals (RN), like ekaika.

1.  RP:

a) As for morphology, paras-para and anyonya (=anyo’nya =anyaH-anya) are formed using a fixed nominative case as a first member, while in itaretara (=itara-itara) the first member is from the stem, without sup.

b) They are used almost always in oblique case, singular number and masculine gender (i.e. meaning common gender). Usually they are in accusative case and have almost a pronominal function (like in English: each other = reciprocally).

c) I suppose that itaretaram can be used only referring to a couple of things/people, while anyonyam and parasparam can be used also with plural reference. E.g. evaM ca parasparaM dvaidham utpannaM = and so discord arose among them. samAnam itaretaraM praNAdityau (Shankara) = life and sun have a reciprocal unity. I would like to question Abhyankar Mahodaya about this conjecture, due to general semantic role of –tara pratyaya. Is it right?

2.  RN:

a) Repetition of eka both in distinct words or compound (ekaika = eka-eka), doesn’t have any sense of reciprocity.

b) It can have a distributive sense (vipsA): one by one, both as an adjective andan adverb, as well as dvau dvau = dvishaH, aharahaH = day after day. So ekaikam = ekashaH = one by one, singularly.

c) Otherwise it could also have an emphasizing role, like punaH punaH = again and again, shanaiH shanaiH = very slowly, by degrees. So ekaika = just alone, quite lonely, etc.

You can have more examples and explanations in the best and deepest book of Sanskrit Syntax even written so far. It is J.S.Speijer’s Sanskrit Syntax (Leyden, 1886!!!).

BTW I’m involved in logical and cognitive linguistic analysis of reflexive pronouns, Atmanepada voice, -ya passive voice and –ya (4^(th) class) psychological verbs. If you know books related or people interested in it, would you tell me, please?

Thanks,

Piergiorgio Muzi
