Dear Group Members,  
  
Please kindly tell me the texts (with page no. reference, if possible) where the words एकैकम् and इतरेतरम् occur in the sentence. For एकैकम् I have only one instance:  
  
 नापेक्षितो गुरुजनः अनया त्वया पृष्टः न बन्धुजनः।  
 एकैकस्य च चरिते भणामि किम् एकैकम्॥ शाकुन्तलम् ५।१६॥  
  
Likewise there would be many examples available in the Sanskrit literature for these words. Kindly share your information with us with regard to these words. I'd be obliged.  
  
Thank you.  
  
With best regards,  
Madhav
