Dear Mr Murthy,

being a psycholinguist, of course I am a bit - or too -pedantic. Language is like a microscope; biologists want to know it only to use it, linguists want to know it in itself, in all its conceptual, logical and semiotic structures and functions, even if they are less or not at all interested in using itin speaking, reading, writing or even translating. But the intuitive knowledge of people who use it is absolutely precious for the linguists, a sine-qua-non condition to understand and explain its "mental mechanisms".

You have distinguished the reciprocity of parasparam andanyonyam from non-reciprocity of itaretarat.

1\) Why? have you any example of the use of itaretarat non-reciprocally?

2\) Why have you written itaretarat and not itaretaram, so expressing its being neuter (supposedly and adverb)

3\) Iagree with you about there being some differences. parasparam and anyonyam are not real compounds, in contrast with itaretarat: the first term of both ones is nom.sing. masc. and the second is acc.sing.masc. (they are not neuter with adverbial function, otherwise they should be: \*para-param and \*anyAnyat). Could you elaborate the nature of this difference both semantically and morphologically?

4\) As for the sense and function of ekaikam, do you have any real examples from literature? what is your opinion about this?

Thetopic of reciprocal pronouns isdiscussed intensively not only inside chomskyan linguistic, but also in cognitive semantics and so also in cognitive sciences and even neuropsychology.

In my recent email to Mr Madhav Iexpress the importance of real intuitions of the speakers (and possibly writers) of a language. S. Kuno in his Functional Syntax, Anaphora, Discourse and Empathy (and other following works)gave large technical demonstration of the importance of empathy factors in the grammatical rulesreferring to reciprocalsentences.

Thanks for your very learned co-operation! (please, don't feel yourself pedant if you are detailingcarefully! somebody could be bored, others could be very gladly involved).

Thanks, regards,

Piergiorgio Muzi
