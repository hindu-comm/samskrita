That is not what the author of that article claims. He claims that the  
ONLY the last digit is incorrect  
The 32nd digit is best rounded off as "5". But the mnemonic shloka has  
it rounded off as "2".  
  
I understand that Swami Sri Bharati Krsna Tirtha has an unusual and  
personal kaTapayAdi system. The one more commonly used by karanATaka-  
saMgIta musicians has a slightly different code. Someone who has  
studied karanATaka-saMgIta may please confirm or correct this  
statement.
