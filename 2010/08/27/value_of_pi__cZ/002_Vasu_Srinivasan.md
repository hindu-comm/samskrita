IIRC, only one digit was wrong in that pi formula.  
  
The karnataka sangita uses "kAdi dasa TAdi dasa pAdi pancaka yAdyashtaka" (in reality it is 1-9,0; not 0-9). Again this does not pertain to the music itself, but to the naming classification of some ragas.  
  
Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha uses "kAdi nava TAdi nava pAdi pancaka yAdyashtaka ksha SUnyam". ksha = sUnyam is probably a later introduction.  
  
The earliest references to katapayAdi system are said to be in vararuchi's chandra vAkya. Kerala mathameticians have developed this much further.  
  
Aryabhatta uses his own numerical scheme for encoding astronomical numbers.
