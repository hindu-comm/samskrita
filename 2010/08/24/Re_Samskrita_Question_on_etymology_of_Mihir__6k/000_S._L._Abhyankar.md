**Relax, Mr. Mihir !**  
You have a meaningful Sanskrit name !  
Your gmail-name "jannat" of course has Persian origin :-) It means "Heaven", right ?  
  
**मिहिर** is very much a sanskrit word. It means sun. It has also other meanings such as A cloud; The moon; Wind, air  
  
**मिहिराण** means शिव, maybe, because he has **मिहिर** the moon on his head.  
  
On Page 762 in Apte's "Practical Sanskrit Dictionary" available for free download on the internet, the reference quotations mentioned are -  
मयि तावन्मिहिरोऽपि निर्दयोऽभूत् । Bv. 2.34  
याते मय्यचिरान्निदाघमिहिरज्वालाशतैः शुष्कताम् । 1.16; N. 2 36; 13.54  
The etymology is given as मिह् - किरच् Un. 1.51  
मिह् means to sprinkle, to spray. Since both sun and moon sprinkle light, the word **मिहिर** has both the meanings - as sun and as moon.  
  
BTW, the Shah of Iran, (who was dethroned by Ayatullah Khomenei) had among his many decorations, one decoration as **आर्यमिहिर** Maybe, knowledge of such decoration of also the forefathers of the Shah might have prompted Mr. Max-Muller to trace the etymology to Persia. But note the word **आर्य** also in that decoration ! Simply put, **आर्यमिहिर** means "like sun among Aryans"
