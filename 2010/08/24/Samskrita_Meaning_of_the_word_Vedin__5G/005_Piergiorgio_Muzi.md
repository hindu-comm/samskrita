Yes, dear Vimala, viveda is a possible and regular form ofthe perfect of the root vid. I much appreciate your serch for explanations. But the form without root-duplication is probably the original form and it is the only Arian perfect without duplication (you can find the corrispondent non-duplicate perfect in Old Greek (v)oida = I know and German Ich weiss = I know, always with present sense; etc.). Viveda is oftener used as the perfect of the same, but differentiated, root with present vindati = to find. It is difficult to ascertain if there was contraction of vi+vi, and thisof course earlier than in I.E. reconstructed forms. Too far in time...Generally it is consider the only non-duplicated form of perfect in original I.E. Anyway, apart from vid, the roots with intermediate a don't showthe duplication but the changeof a into e. This is a completely different matter, since e is the guNa of i (so: veda, plur. viduH), whileit is not the guNa, northe vRddhiof a. Tha root pat has regular duplication in singular 3 p. papAta, but a "strange" pet-in weak forms (3 p. plur pet-uH). So, this change and the lost of duplication in weak forms must have other explanations. One, possible but not sure, is theanalogical generalization starting from sa-sAda, plur.sa-sd-uH \> sed-uH, due toregular dropping of s (becoming z before voiced stop) in front of dandthe connected change of a into e. Compare the imperative of as: edhi from as-dhi \> az-dhi> edhi. As for the dropping of a in week degree, this is very common.SIdati\< si-sd-ati, like tiShTati \< ti -STH-ati, etc.And pat has a-pa-pt-am as a duplicated aorist. About these (pre-)historical facts you can check MacDonnell's grammar (p.111, note 1; p115, par. 139, 3).These facts are better discussed inside comparative linguistics with their richbibliographical production.

As a logical confirmation, you can notice that we have ved in strong forms (sing) and vid in weak ones, but we have pat or pAt in strong forms and pet in the weak ones...It is only an apparent contradiction!
