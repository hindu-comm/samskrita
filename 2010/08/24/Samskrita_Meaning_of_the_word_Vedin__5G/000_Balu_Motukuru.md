Hello Everyone



My Namaskarams to all of you.

One of my friends has a baby boy and he named him as 'Vedin'.

Welooked up the dictionary and found the meaning as Brahma or Knowledgable.

But I would like to know the literal meaning of the word and how it is related to the word 'Veda'.



Please let me know your thoughts.



Thanks

Balu
