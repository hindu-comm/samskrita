Dear Prof Muzi

I have noted that MacDonnell lists vid as a irregularity and is a non-duplicated form. Thanks for your explanation that it precedes current Indo-Aryan grammar. Yes, there are weak and strong stems of roots with medial vowels such as tan, and the change from a to e happens in the weak stem, tene, but we also get the e form in the dual and plural perfect forms of the strong stem, but not in the singular. I do not know why this happens. In Prakrit of GAndhArI there is terminal weakening and there is intervocalic weakening so –ata- , becomes –ada-
and then –aya- ; the ca can be ya and number of other platalals – yi, i, and then e. The weakening of the va- to u is the samprasAraNa rule.
Thank you very much for your explanation. I need to think about what you have said. You have a very broad perspective.

Best wishes

Vimala
