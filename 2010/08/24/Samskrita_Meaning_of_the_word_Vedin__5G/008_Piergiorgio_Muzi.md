Dear Vimala, I am very glad to exchange rational conjectures about Sanskrit language. This is not only conform to scientific and logical methods of linguistics, but also to the true spirit of traditional Indian grammarians.

What you have said about so called “lenition” (from Latin lenis= soft), it is very important, since it can have relation with our topic. Lenition is very common in evolution of spoken languages. From Lat. amatus, we get Span. amado… In French the evolution goes forth and it ends up with: aimé, after disappearing of the dental stop. We have many many examples of this process, above all in Celtic languages and in French. Your examples are quite similar. Maybe this can suggest that e(from intervocalic a) comes after sort of internal lenition and successive fusion of vocalic sounds. This is possible, even if we don’t have a general rule for this, nor a clear phonological explanation of different cases. I mean: from pat, we can have pt in a-pa-pt-am, why not for dual and pluralforms of perfect? Why petuH rather than pa-pt-uH? Well, sometimes there are both possibilities. So the Atm. Perf. of tan can be tene or ta-tn-e (really, vaidic). So it is possible the clear lenition of s in sd (>zd, since d is soft) produced an i-sound: sa-s\[a\]d \> sa-zd \> sa-id (=sed). From this we have a generalization, which we can’t understand very easily why.

SamprasAraNa is a very simple case, where the dropping of a, by passing from guNa to weak degree, implies the vocalization of v, y , r (we must remember that the fundamental degree of roots is the guNa, since it is proved comparatively and also because of the of homogeneity of apophonic rules in a synchronistic analysis of the language). So grah, has gRh, vac has uc, vas has uSh, yaj has ij… (always with other internal sandhi changes). But also in this case not all the roots starting with v, y, r have samprasAraNa in the root-syllable. We don’t know why. E.g. vas (= clothe) never has. vas (=dwell) has. The same is for the root vas (= shine). It is interesting the fact that vas (=clothe) hasn’t samprasAraNa also in the duplicating syllable.

About the so-called long roots and heavy roots, the linguistic problems are multiple. As for a sub-class of them, we have to deal with residual of schwa or laryngeal sounds, like in dha+ (=dhA), da+ (=dA), stha+ (=sthA), bhav+, ne+… (I have written + to refer to that - a bit mysterious – phoneme or maybe class of phonemes). The apophony rules were specifically and deeply modified and a lot of adjustment came out from the internal sandhi. But this a too complex matter for an email…

May I suggest a serious introductory text? It is O.S.L.Szemerenyi, Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics (Oxford Un. Press, 1999). I think that also The Sanskrit Language of T.Burrow should be appreciated by your so deep interest.

Best wishes and best goodwill!
