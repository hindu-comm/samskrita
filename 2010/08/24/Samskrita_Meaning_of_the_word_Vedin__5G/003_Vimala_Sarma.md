Dear Balu Mahodaya

My pleasure.

I could add that the rule for prefect tense reduplication in a root with medial vowel (between two consonants) such as in roots vid, man, pad etc, is that the first syllable reduplicates and then contracts to e (long vowel), so vivi- becomes ve and thus we get veda, (1^(st) and 3^(rd) sing,) etc. Veda though in the past perfect also has a present meaning – “he knows” and “I know”.



I think Vedin is a nice name and may set a trend!
