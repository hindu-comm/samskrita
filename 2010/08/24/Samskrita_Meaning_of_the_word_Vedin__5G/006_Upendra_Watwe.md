Abhyankarji,

Your explanation should help strengthen the thought that sikhism is an integral part of hinduism.

Sikhism is thus a more practical form of hinduism devoid of the bad practices of sati and the birth based caste system.

  

I had also heard that sikh is a mispronounced/ coloquial form of shishya- or disciple.

Thank you all for the wonderful and enlightening discussions on this forum.

Upendra
