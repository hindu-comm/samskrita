Balu Mahodaya

The root is vid which is know; veda is the perfect, but also viveda; - knew – most famously used in the phrase “ya evam veda” “(he) who knew thus”; but also in the sense of what is known – ie the Vedas (shruti)**

The suffix –in means a person having that attribute or quality such as a in “yogin”;

So vedin means one skilled in knowledge of the Vedas, and the nominative singular masc is vedI, such as the surname TrivedI (knower of the three Vedas.

Hope this helps.
