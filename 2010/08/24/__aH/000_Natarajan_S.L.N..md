Dear friends,

 My daughter has given birth to a male child.

 As his star( nakshatra) is Makham second padha, he is to be named beginning with "MI".

 I have selected the name "MIHISHARA" which means first the Sun and then the cloud and Moon also.

 "MIHISHARANA" is an epithet of Lord SIVA.

 Please comment on this and give your esteemed suggestions and ideas for a better naming.

 Thanking you.
