Srini Mahodaya

Yes – I have the translation (Olivelle) already. Interested to know how SaMkara treats or explains the sAMkhya elements such as 3.i and 13.4 (bhoktA) and the use of the word puruSa. The later sections are thought to be added subsequently, as there seems to be a definite conclusion to
YAma’s teachings in 3.16-17.



Thanks Vimala
