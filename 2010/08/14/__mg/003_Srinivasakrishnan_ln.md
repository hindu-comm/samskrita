I think Vimala Mahodaya asked for the translation of Sankarabhashya. Presumably she already has the translation of the Upanisad text itself.



Vimala Mahodaya, you can do various things depending on where you live:



1\. You can check the bookstoreof the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam.



<http://books.arshavidya.org/cgi-bin/process/shop/display/main?type=display&subtype=category&arg=category&value=Vedanta%20%26%20Other%20Philosophies>



2\. You can check the catalog of the Ramakrishna Mission



3\. You can also check for some ebooks for download - I doubt one exists with a Sankara bhashya translation

There's also this site:



<http://hinduebooks.blogspot.com/>



4\. Your best bet is the following blog which has Sankara commentary and explanation/discussion. Looks like it is from Swami Paramarthananda'sdiscussions. It has the complete Adhyaya 1 valli 3. You have to navigate to the appropriate post based on the mantra you're interested in.
