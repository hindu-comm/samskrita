Hi Friends,

  

I have a question on thepronunciationand meaning of some of the stuff (for lack of better words) we speak.

  

From what I understand, when vedic swaras are used (udatta, swarita etc), the meaning of the recited word /sentenceis determined by the correspondinggrammar. Stated in reverse, the (vedic)grammardictates the meaning of the words /sentenceswhen pronounced with vedic swaras.

  

I intentionally put a slightly different meaning in the second (reverse) statement. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

  

The question I have is - Does vedic grammer (or that part of the standard grammer) still determine the meaning of the normalsentenceswhen they are pronounced as-if there are swaras (mostlty anudatta and swarita) ? In other words, are we supposed to talk just in the same pitch ?

  

Many a times, we add a bit emotion to what we speak, so the pitch varies. Also, the stress on ensuring the correct swara is being used is not so much when shlokas are being recited as opposed to the *mantras.*
Does this mean its a problem since the meaning we are conveying is different from what is intended ?

I hope I conveyed my question, and have not complicated the issue. Please enlighten me,

  

Thanks
