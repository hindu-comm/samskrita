When saMskRta was a spoken language, (not just veda) words were  
accented.  
  
pANini makes a special exception for "rote learning" when language can  
be spoken without accents. He means "rote chanting of vedic hymns", I  
suppose. (yaj\~jakarmaNi-a-japanyuN^kha-sAmasu \| 1.2.34) I suppose that  
someone speaking for real without accents would be unimaginable to  
pANini. Unvfortunately, it has come to that now. Even non-vedic  
saMskRta is spoken after rote learning. So all of us speak saMskRta  
without the correct accents.  
  
There is no "vedic grammar dictate" regarding use of svara. All native  
speech (even non-vedic) by native speakers is accented. In veda or non-  
veda, meaning may change if the accent is incorrect. (I think this  
respomnds to your question.)  
  
Some of the later saMskRta shlokas (written by non-native speakers)  
deliberately uses double meaning which happens by the ignorance of  
svaras. If you want to enjoy such funny shlokas, ignorance regarding  
svara is essential.  
  
Fortunately, we are not conveying meaning other than that is intended,  
in most cases. This is because many words are unambiguous even if  
mispronounced with respect to the svaras. So if you and I say "bhaja  
govindam" with the most atrocious svara, it still means nothing  
different than "worship govinda!"  
  
No worries.  
  
By the way, the most important svara are not anudAtta and svarita.  
Every word has one UDAATTA (rarely, one SVARITA), which is very  
important. Following the udAtta is a svarita (because the udAtta  
continues slightly into the next vowel) and the rest of the vowels are  
either anudAtta or ekashruti (=vague-accented). If you get your udAtta  
right, the accents take care of themselves.
