Dear Hans Nilsson,

Your description appears to be correct. In the following, I have  
inserted comments as CAPITAL LETTERS. Please note that this is for  
convenience of distinguishing my comments, and in no way should you  
consider this is disrespectful "shouting".

\> 1. Lexical categories  
\> 1.1 Paninian view  
\> \<pada (word)> ::= \<subanta (nominal)> \| \<tiṅanta(verb)>  ; A 1.4.14  
\> \<avyaya (indeclinable)> ::= \<svarādi (sun etc.)> ; A 1.1.37-41  
\>                    \| \< nipāta (particles) \> 
  ; A 1.1.56  
\>                    \| \<upasarga (preverb)>   
; A 1.4.58  
\>                    \| \<gati \>         
       ; A 1.4.60 (=upasarga)  
\> \<subanta> ::= \<prātipadika> \[\<sUP>\]  
\> ; Panini has only two main word classes. He includes avyayas in subanta, adding endings and then deleting them again in A 2.4.82!   
\> This is described above by \<sUP> being optional.

THIS IS APPROPRIATE. avyaya WORDS HAVE THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS AS  
subanta, E.G. FORCING A FOLLOWING VERB TO BE UNACCENTED. avyayaS ALSO  
HAVE SYNTACTIC CASE, SIMILAR TO ALL OTHER subanta pada WORDS. THERE IS  
NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY CREATING A SEPARATE CLASS OF WORDS OTHER THAN  
subanta OR tiN^anta

\> ; Yāska, who preceded Panini, made the following categorization of word classes:  

I WILL NOT COMMENT ON yAska

\> 1.2. Relation to modern/English lexical categories  
\> \<subanta> ::= \<NOUN> \| \<ADJECTIVE> \| \<PRONOUN>  
\>            \| \<ADVERB> \| \<CONJUNCTION> \| \<PREPOSITION>  
\> \< nipāta> ::= \<CONJUNCTION> \| \<PREPOSITION>  

nipāta SHOULD BE SUBCLASS OF SUBANTA  
THERE IS A SPECIAL CLASS OF nipAta LISTED UNDER "chAdayo.asatve" THIS  
INCLUDES WORDS LIKE cha (and) vA (or), ETC. THEY DO NOT HAVE  
SUBSTANCE- MEANING. FOR THAT MATTER NEITHER DO THE upasarga  
"PREVERBS". HOWEVER THE ANALYSIS OF MEANING BELONGS TO SEMANTICS. AS  
FAR AS MORPHOLOGY, SYNTAX AND PHONETICS OF ACCENT ARE CONCERNED, THESE  
BEHAVE EXACTLY AS subanta

\> \<ADVERB> ::= \< svarādi \>                  ; as listed in gaṇapāṭha  
\>             \| \<kriyā-viśeṣana>            
; derived, e.g. by taddhita  

THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY CATEGORY. WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES svarAdi INTO  
"ADVERBS"? IN ENGLISH SUPPOSEDLY "TOMORROW" IS AN ADVERB. SO IN THE  
TWO EXAMPLES "I WILL ARRIVE TOMORROW" AND "TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY",  
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT LEXICAL WORDS "TOMORROW", THE FIRST BEING AN  
ADVERB, THE SECOND BEING A NOUN. IT IS SILLY TO TRANSFER THIS TO  
saMskRta. "shvaH" (meaning tomorrow) IS ONE LEXICAL UNIT.  
ahaM shvaH AgamiShyAmi \| (I will arrive tomorrow.)  
HERE shvaH IS IN THE LOCATIVE, AND IS IN THE adhikaraNa OF THE VERB  
AgamiShyAmi  
shvaH anyo divasaH asti \|  
HERE shvaH IS IN THE NOMINATIVE, AND IS kartA OF THE VERB asti  
WHY BOTHER CALLING IT TWO DIFFERENT LEXICAL UNITS?

\> ; P does not clearly differentiate between adjectives (viśeṣaṇa) and nouns.  
\> Only in A 2.1.57 does he talk about viśeṣaṇa (qualifying) and viśeṣya (qualified).  

VERY GOOD. "visheShaNa" IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LOGIC, AND IS VERY  
SLIGHTLY RELATED TO GRAMMAR. ANY WORD MAY QUALIFY ANY OTHER WORD. AS  
FAR AS LOGIC IS CONCERNED A SO-CALLED "VERB" CAN QUALIFY A SO-CALLED  
NOUN. (THE PREDICATE QUALIFIES THE SUBJECT. THE PREDICATE CAN BE A  
VERB. THIS IS NOT A CONFUSION OF TERMS. THE PREDICATE SPECIFIES AND  
LIMITS THE GENERAL MEANING OF THE SUBJECT EXACTLY AS A SO-CALLED  
ADJECTIVE SPECIFIES AND LIMITS THE GENERAL MEANING OF THE NOUN IT  
QUALIFIES) THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GRAMMAR.

RARELY WHEN SEMANTICS PRECEDES ETYMOLOGY E.G., IN SPECIFICATION OF  
MEANING 1.2.52 : visheShaNAnAM chAjAteH \|,  
samAsa OR OTHER COMPOUNDS, 1.2.65 ; 2.1.57, 2.2.35, pANini USES THE  
TERM "visheShaNa". THIS IS NEVER A LEXICAL CATEGORY, BUT RATHER A  
LOGICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORDS.

\> Adjectives were not recognized as a separate lexical category until 1747 (ref. Wikipedia).  

DRATS. WHY? WHAT HAPPENED IN 1747? THE FIRST BRITISH TERRITORIAL GAIN  
IN INDIA WAS 1757. :-) THIS IS A JOKE.

\>  
\> ; According to Gombrich (”He cooks softly”: Adverbs in Sanskrit Grammar), «  
\> words which appear to as to be adverbs, or used adverbially, are heterogeneously  
\> classified by P.  

THEY ARE IN FACT HETEROGENEOUS.

\> All come into the category of subanta.  

GOOD.

\> 2. Morphology  
\> \<pada> ::= \<subanta> \| \<tiṅanta>  ; A 1.4.14  
\> \<vibhakti> ::= \<sUP> \| \<tiN> ; A 1.3.104  
\> \<prakṛti (base word)> ::= \<dhātu> \| \<prātipadika>  
\> \<pada> ::= \<prakṛti> \[\<pratyaya>\] \[\<vibhakti>\]  
\> ; prakṛti + vibhakti => inflected primitive verb or inflected primitive nominal  
\> ; prakṛti + pratyaya => derived avyaya, e.g. adverb  
\>  
\> \<pratyaya (affix)> ::=                      ; A 3.1.1   
\>              \<kṛt (primary)>             
 ; A 3.1.93  
\>            \| \< taddhita (secondary)>      ; A 4.1.76  
\>            \| \<vikaraṇa (infix)>  
\>            \| \<sanādi (verb derivation)>   

\>            \| \<strī (feminine)>            
; uncertain if it belongs here or not (FINE)

\> ; I have excluded sUP and tiN from the list of pratyayas, even though they can be argued to also be pratyayas. Everything gets clearer this way.  

WHY? WHAT IS CLEARER? BUT OK. NOT A HUGE OBJECTION. IF IT IS CLEARER  
FOR YOU BY ALL MEANS CLASSIFY sUP and tiN SEPARATELY. THEY ARE  
ESSENTIALLY "CLOSING" MORPHOLOGICAL AFFIXES. AS SOON AS YOU AFFIX  
THEM, NO OTHER AFFIXES CAN BE ATTACHED. SO MAYBE THEY ARE SPECIAL.

  
\> 2.1 Tinanta morphology  
\> \<tiṅanta \> ::= \<dhātu> \<tiN>  
\> \<tiN> ::= "tiP" \| … \| "mahiN" ; A 3.4.77  
\> \<dhātu (verbal base)> ::= \< mūla? dhātu (primitive)> \| \<vyutpanna? dhātu (derived)>  
\> \< mūla dhātu> ::= \<bhūvādayaḥ dhātu>   ; from dhātupāṭha, A 1.3.1  
\> \<vyutpanna dhātu> ::=  
\>               \<sanādyantāḥ dhātu>    
\>             \| \<dhātu>\<vikaraṇa>  
\> \<sanādyantāḥ dhātu> ::=  
\>             \<sannanta (desiderative)> \| \<yaṇanta (intensive)>  
\>            \| \<nijanta (causative)> \| \<nāmadhatū (verbal noun)>

GOOD

\> 2.2 Subanta morphology  
\> \<subanta> ::= \< prakṛti> \[\<pratyaya>\] \[\<sUP>\]  
\> ; A few examples:  
\> ; prātipadika + sUP => inflected noun  
\> ; prātipadika + pratyaya + sUP => inflected derived noun  

GOOD

\> ; prātipadika + pratyaya => adverb (kriyā-viśeṣana)    
WHAT!!!??? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. DO YOU MEAN :  
prātipadika + pratyaya + sUP => (IF AN ENGLISHMAN WANTS TO CALL IT SO  
FOR PERSONAL GRATIFICATION) adverb (kriyā-viśeṣana)

\> ; dhātu + kṛt + sUP => inflected krdanta  

OK. BUT dhātu + kṛt IS A prātipadika , SO IT IS ALREADY COVERED  
ABOVE. SEE 1.2.46 YOU SEEM TO KNOW THIS BELOW: vyutpanna prAtipAdika

}}} GOOD

\> 3. Other grammatical elements  
\> \<purusa (person> ::=                      ; A 1.4.101  
\>              \| \<prathama (third)>  
\>              \| \<madhyama (second)>  
\>              \| \<uttama (first)>  
\> \<vacana (number)> ::=                     ; A 1.4.102-3  
\>              \| \<ekavacana>  
\>              \| \<dvivacana>  
\>              \| \<bahuvacana>  

OK. GOOD. THIS IS MORPHOLOGICAL.

\> \<vyakti/liṅga (gender)> ::=  
\>              \| \<puṃlinga (masc.)>  
\>              \| \<strīliṅga (fem.)>  
\>              \| \<napuṃsakaliṅga (neut.)>  

pANIni RECOGNIZES GENDER, BUT CONSIDERS IT (a) LEXICAL, BEYOND THE  
SCOPE OF GRAMMAR, OR (b) IN CASE OF FEMININE FORM DERIVATIONS, A  
SEMANTIC CONSIDERATION THAT INTRUDES INTO MORPHOLOGY

\> \<lakārāḥ> ::= \<lAṬ>          ; varttamāna (present tense) A 3.2.123  
\>            \| \<lIṬ>            ; bhūta-anadyatana parokṣa ( perfect) A 3.2.115  
\>            \| \<lUṬ>           ; bhaviṣya-anadyatana (periph. future) A 3.3.15  
\>            \| \<lŖṬ>           ; bhaviṣyati (simple future) A 3.3.13  
\>            \| \<lOṬ>           ; (imperative) A 3.3.162  
\>            \| \<lAṄ>          ; anadyatana-bhūta (imperfect) A 3.2.111  
\>            \| \<lIṄ>           ;(optative) A 3.3.161  
\>            \| \<lUṄ>          ; bhūta (aorist) A 3.2.110  
\>            \| \<lŖṄ>          ; (conditional)A 3.3.139  

OK, GOOD. THIS IS MORPHOLOGICAL.

\>  
\> \<kāraka (case)> ::=                        
; A 1.4.23  
\>                \<kartā (agent)>           
 ; A 1.4.54-55  
\>              \| \<karma (object)>           ; A 1.4.49-53  
\>              \| \<karaṇa (instrument)>      ; A 1.4.42-44  
\>              \| \<sampradāna (purpose)>   ; A 1.4.32-41  
\>              \| \<apādāna (separation)>    ; A 1.4.24-31  
\>              \| \<adhikaraṇa (location)>    ; A 1.4.45-48   
\>  

OK, GOOD. THIS IS SYNTACTIC. ITS MORPHOLOGICAL CORRELATE IS "prathamA-  
saptamI vibhakti" ALREADY MENTIONED BY YOU EARLIER.
