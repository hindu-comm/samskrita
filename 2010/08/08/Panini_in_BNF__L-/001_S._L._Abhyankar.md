Dear Mr. Hans Nilsson,

नमो नमः श्रीमन् "हंस (हान्स) निल्सन्"-महोदय !



Your message set me thinking a lot.

  

First of all, since अष्टाध्यायी has अष्ट अध्यायाः and चतुष्पादाः प्रत्येके अध्याये, I guess you will end up extending the study much further. So, I saved your PDF filein my "Sanskrit Grammar"folder, as "Hans Nilsson 01" :-)

  

A few observations, please -

1\. Since your approach is to make a structured description, I get to recall the tabular structures I presented in my lessons for "Learning Sanskrit by fresh approach". There, apart from the steps for सन्धि-विच्छेदाः and समास-विग्रहाः I used tabular structures for

I also thought it good to have structures separately for

I did not use any structures for 1.4 theIndeclinablesअव्ययानि You will appreciate the logic of not having any structure for these, because they are "indeclinabes", though I had to have structure for 1.3.1

  

It comes to mind that the topic ofprefixes उपसर्गाः becomes a topic for study by itself. Please comment.

  

Honestly I am not convinced of your concept where you state "I have therefore decided to use the term base, which does not contain any botanical connotation..." I really wonder how one would explain a wordप्रणिपातेन My questions with reference to this word would be -

1 Which is the base - पत् प्रणिपत् प्रणिपात् प्रणिपात ?

2 You have taken cognisance of\< mūla dhātu> ::=
\<bhūvādayaḥdhātu> ; from dhātupāṭha, A 1.3.1

3 You have also taken cognisance of
