Dear Mr. Natarajan,  
  
First, I thought, yours is a simple question !  
"सं**पा**दक" = Editor  
But I also started thinking what would its etymology be ?  
This may have its etymology as -  
सं**पा**दक = सं + **पा**द + क where  
सं = Put together, compile  
**पा**द = quarter, section, part  
क = doer  
सं**पा**दक = पादान् "सं" करोति इति संपादकः He, who does compiling, putting together of parts  
  
Thinking of **पा**द = quarter, it comes to mind that **पा**द also means foot. My own name श्रीपाद has पाद in it.  
Feet are  
- two with humans and birds  
- four with quadrupeds,  
- many more with centipedes and millipedes and  
- none with reptiles or even for sea-lions and for most amphibians and for ghosts :- (  
  
A stanza is normally written in two lines or in four lines and each line is also called as **पा**द or चरण  
  
Actually an editor does more than compilation.  
He is supposed to "edit" = delete, correct, re-arrange, add.  
He is supposed to also contribute an editorial !  
  
Interesting ?  
  
सस्नेहम् ,  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः \|
