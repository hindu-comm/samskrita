नमो नमः "उज्ज्वल लामिछाने"-महोदय !  
  
In writing it is better to make the nasal sound in संपादक, or in any other word, clearer by using the appropriate अनुनासिक ।  
As is known, we have five अनुनासिकाः belonging to five classes of व्यञ्जनानि -  
क-वर्ग ङ् as in अङ्क  
च-वर्ग ञ् as in व्यञ्-जनम्  
ट-वर्ग ण् as in अण्ड  
त-वर्ग न् as in तन्त्र  
प-वर्ग म् as in अम्ब  
As can be seen, Google does give the appropriate अनुनासिक to be used.  
Appropriate अनुनासिक is the अनुनासिक belonging to the class, to which the consonant after the nasal sound belongs. But if an अनुनासिक is followed by another अनुनासिक as in मन्मथ, then both should be seen distinctly.  
This will be clearer when thinking of words सम्मति and सन्मति \|  
सम्मति = "I agree" सन्मति = good thinking  
Maybe, it would be permissible to write सम्मति also as संमति।  
Likewise it would be permissible to writeसम्पादक also as संपादक  
However that would not be permissible for सन्मति, right ?  
So, do we see a rule there ? If the nasal sound is going to be of the same class as of the consonant following it, one may use the dot above the previous letter. If not, both the nasal sounds should be seen distinctly.  
I guess पाणिनी-सूत्राणि were developed only by such detailed study !  
Honestly, I have not at all studied पाणिनी-सूत्राणि \|  
Those who have studied would be able to give us promptly, which सूत्र summarizes the rule which has emerged in the above study.  
But it is all logical, and so much interesting, isn't it ?
