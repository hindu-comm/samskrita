Namaste,



In order to familiarize myself more with Panini’s Astadhyahi, I haver written a small Perl program to decline nouns and conjugate verbs, just based on Panini’s rules.



So far, it handles the simplest noun endings (consonants, -a, -A, -i, -I and –u correctly. I have now started with the archetypical verb root pac, and I get endings in present (LAT) and imperfect (LAN) correct, except for third person plural «apacan» which comes out as «apacant». I have not been able to find any rule that prescribes the deletion of the final t. The derivation goes somewhat like this: (Please note that all rules evaluated are listed, but only a few are actually used for this verb form):



pacjhi # -- tinanta rules --

pacajhi # 3.1.68 insert SaP

pacajhi # if LUN or LAN or LRN

apacajhi # 6.1.71 insert a

apacajhi # if L\*N

apacajh # 3.4.100

apacajh # 3.4.101

apacajh # 7.3.101 s/a(\[yvrlmn\])/A/

apacaant # 7.1.3 s/(paca.\*)jh/pacaant/

apacaant # 7.2.81 s/(paca.\*)A/iy/

apacaant # -- general sandhi rules --

apacaant # 6.1.66 delete y/v before

apacant # 6.1.97 s/a(\[aeo\])/a/

apacant # 6.1.87 guna replaces a/A + iC

apacant # 6.1.88 vrddhi replaces a/A + eC

apacant # 6.1.101 Replace double vowel with long

apacant # 6.1.87 guna replaces a/A + iC

apacant # 8.2.30 replace c with k



Can someone more experienced in the Astadhyayi help me out?
