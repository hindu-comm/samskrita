Excellent, thank you Deejay! I had not realized that no word can end in two consecutive consonants!

By the way, have you (and other members of the list) noticed, that all volumes of RN Sharmas excellent translation and comments of the Astadhyayi are available online as scanned djvu fils at:

<http://cid-64ca520e752d39ed.office.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public/vyakaranam/ashtadhyayi/Ram%20Nath%20Sharma>

I do not know if this is legal/allowed or not, but it has certainly been very useful for me (although I have the first three volumes as real books).
