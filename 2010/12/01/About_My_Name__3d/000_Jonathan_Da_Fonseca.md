***Namaste  
Dear Sanskrit Lovers  
I apologise if, for most of you, is a not relevant e-mail but because of so many "complains-doubts" that I have received I feel the obligatio to clear about. In reality, among the people-race I have born, we have two names: a daily one and a spiritual that only some receives and this has been my heritage. When I became a PhD in four different subjects I was to young for :) - at least this is my conclusion about in this last decade, at least - so, at that time I decided to "play" with my names for to, very quickly, identify the Department origin of my mails and e-mails and this is the reason why some people, sometimes, see me appearing with one name and after discovere me under another name. Also, this names change with the degree of familiarity or interest deepness of mine and all of tis works under sucessive combinations :)  
Hoping to stop with doubts as also hoping this will not be a matter for any kind of suspicions or bad understandings.  
Sincerely and always Yours  
Jonathan Rosh
