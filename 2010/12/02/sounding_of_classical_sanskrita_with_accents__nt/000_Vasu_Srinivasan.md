Has anyone attempted to record classical sanskrita with udAtta, anudAtta and svarita accents ? I keep seeing the accents being used in ashytAdhyAyi for specific purposes and that information is gleaned only from commentaries, but how do they sound in spoken classical sanskrita ?  
  
I have seen - Tamil as spoken by Srilankan Tamilians, Sinhala and Malayalam too have a musical tone attached to, when they speak the modulation goes up and down in a very musical way... Would classical Sanskrita with accents have sounded the similar way ?
