Thanks for the topic raised and answered efficiently. I also had noticed the similarities between the ;words and also with grammar too in agreement of genders and verbs and agents/nouns. My instructor of Russian used to say the grammar of Russian is the most difficult one to acquire and then I answered if it is not so, please pardon me. I was able to easily follow and understand grammar and replied that it may not be so than Sanskrit grammar. I had at that time even translated to and from Sanskrit at random.

  

It was long ago in 1980s and I lost touch at all as I could not pursue the study of the course continuously. I will be glad to go through the sites provided in the above posts and have a happy reading and reminiscence of any Russian words remnants in my memory.

  

Thanks for the group and Arvind Kolhatkar and those replied him.
