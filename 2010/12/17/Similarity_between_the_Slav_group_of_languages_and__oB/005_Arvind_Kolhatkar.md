Vasu and Yuri,  
  
Thanks for your responses and offers of help. I shall revert to you  
for them when required.  
  
I have downloaded the monograph for which Yuri sent the link. It  
tells us that there indeed is a great similarity between the Slavic  
group of languages on the one hand and Sanskrit/ancient Persian on the  
other. However, nothing much is known about the ancient history of  
the peoples speaking Slavic languages and there is a complete absence  
of any archaeological,anthropological and literary evidence showing  
any connection between these two groups of peoples. Therefore, the  
question why there is such remarkable similarity cannot be answered,  
at least for now, beyond the obvious conclusion that at some time in  
the distant past they lived together or were close neighbors. I am  
satisfied with that and one ghost has been put to rest for me.  
  
I wonder whether an expert can create a mathematical formula to work  
out a coefficient of closeness between two connected languages as a  
function of time. I suppose if this can be done, the coefficient will  
let us measure the elapsed time before today since the two peoples  
moved away from each other.
