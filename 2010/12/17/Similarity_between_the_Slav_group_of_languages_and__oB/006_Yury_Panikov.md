Arvind,  
  
I think that for you would be interesting to look at some currently forgotten [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arctic_Home_in_the_Vedas) by Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  
  
[There some other](http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/proceedings-of-the-russian-academy-of-dna-genealogy-2010-december-vol-3-no-12/14259781) recent interesting archaeological evidences(in Russian).  
  
For mathematical modelling I assume would be better to take Vedic Sanskrit, as it has more cognitives in roots and morphology due to research of [Tatyana Elizarenkova.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatyana_Elizarenkova)  
  
  
Regards,  
Yury
