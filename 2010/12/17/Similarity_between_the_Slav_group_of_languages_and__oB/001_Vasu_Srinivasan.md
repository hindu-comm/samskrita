Having studied in Russia, I have always believed Sanskrita and Russian have been related. As you mentioned there are lot of Russian verb roots that can be traced to Sanskrita. There is an active group (nagari@googlegroups) that discusses such stuff. You can join that and post questions there too. Also the group maintains an extensive list of Sanskrita and Russian related words. There is also a pdf that goes very deep into the similarities between the two.  
  
The Russian script is Cyrillic, but the core language itself, I feel is a lot closer to Sanskrita than Latin or Greek, though later it has come under heavy influence of Latin and English. Several modern words are direct transliterations of English with a Russian sounding ending though a proper noun/verb could be made for each of them using Russian roots itself.  
  
When I was in the early stages of learning Russian, I used to translate some yoga aasana names for my Russian friends/teachers and they were able to easily make out the meaning, and in a few cases just correctly guess the meaning based on root similarity.  
  
Apart from the words you mentioned, well at the very fundamental level there is root "bhU" in Sanskrita and "bits" in Russian.  
  
On personal front, I have noticed that while speaking, I have inadvertently used Russian words in place of Sanskrit words and vice versa and then realized they were different.
