Excellent!!! Finally I have found very interesting forum about subject which is very interesting for me.

Thank you Jury for those links, I uploaded already, and will read it in the evening. It is indeed huge similarity between sanskrit and slavic languages - some words are almost the same with russian, while others are exactly the same with serbian, and similar to polish , slovenian, slovac, and so on, ( so many slavic langueages exist, that I dont gona mention all of them).
