Dear Group,  
  
I have been a member of this Group for a few months but am with  
certain other groups and internet Lists for a long time. I would like  
to submit for your consideration a practice that they generally  
follow. I believe it makes for a more systematic arrangement of all  
postings, pro and con, on a given topic.  
  
When we reply to any message on a topic, we hit the 'Reply' button ,  
compose our reply and then hit the 'Send' button. In doing so, all  
previous replies. replies to replies, replies to replies to replies  
(and so on) get transmitted by default. Sometimes the attached  
portion becomes so long and repetitive, that it is difficult to  
separate the immediately relevant from the more remote. Navigating  
through the mass of enclosed older material becomes laborious.  
  
To avoid this jumble, I would submit that prior to sending the new  
message we cut out the enclosed matter that automatically appears  
below it by default. This makes for a more compact arrangement for  
following a thread. Older material is, in any case, available just  
above it should it be needed for reference. If, in our reply, we want  
to be specific about any observation that a predecessor has made, we  
can just copy-paste that relevant portion in our reply.  
  
In one List where I am a long-standing member, it is actually a  
binding rule to be followed. Members who regularly forget it are  
suspended from membership for a few days as a punitive action.  
  
I submit this for your consideration and approval.
