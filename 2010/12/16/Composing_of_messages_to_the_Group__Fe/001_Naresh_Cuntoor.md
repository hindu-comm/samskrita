Thanks to Arvind Kohlatkar for the reminder.

Sri KNR: "EOM" does not work here.

I will also add another reminder: if you are replying to a digest  
mail, please edit teh subject line to reflect the thread to which you  
are replying. If you replying to more than one thread, reply  
separately to those threads from the digest email.
