Namaste

There are many more messenger poems (dUta/sandesha kavya) almost all of which involve a journey in some part of the country.  
For instance, there is one involving a kokila-sandesha from Kerala, the Hamsa-duta (different from Vedanta Deshika's Hamsa-sandesha) from northern India, I think Bengal, and many others.

Best,

Venetia
