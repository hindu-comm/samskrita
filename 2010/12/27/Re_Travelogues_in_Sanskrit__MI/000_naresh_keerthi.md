Dear all,  
  
I am interested in looking at the various kAvyas which have descriptions of places and routes - i.e, travelogues in SanskRt.  
  
Ones I know of, include the mEghadUtam and the hamsa-sandEsha. there are treatises like the vishwaguNAdarsha-campU and the yAtrA-prabandha.  
  
  
i have heard of a tIrtha-prabandha of the dvaita pontiff vAdirAja, but don't have access to his composition.  
  
Any other input is welcome.  
  
Regards,  
  
Naresh Keerthi
