Dear Abhyankar Mahoday

Namo namaH

I think you said that for three thousand years there was no other dharma, but I may have misunderstood the context. Dharma is really untranslatable and there are a number of approximations in English. In the famous verse in the GItA 18.66, people have also translated that in different ways. Your translation is a good one.
