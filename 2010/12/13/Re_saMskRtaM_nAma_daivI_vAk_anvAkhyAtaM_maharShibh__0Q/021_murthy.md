Dear Sri.Abhyankar,

When Vimalaji says that “when this particular verse was written, Buddhism had spread and was becoming a threat (perhaps at the period of Asoka?)” I do not know if it is implied that the verse could be an extrapolation. Unless there are sufficient grounds to treating a passage as an extrapolation, like marked change in style and diction, obvious discontinuity etc. it would not be correct to treat any passage that does not suit a specific viewpoint to be an extrapolation. One has to concede that a clever extrapolator can get away with his mischief.

There are other time-posts in Valmiki like mention of Cholas, Pandyas, Sakas, Yavanas,Hunas etc which do notencourage us to treat the poet’s time as pre-buddhic.

Regards

Murthy
