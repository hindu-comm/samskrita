Very Good topic round and round Budha to Rama , Prakrita to Sanskrit.

  

The same concern in all aspects discussed. The question of Ramayana, Brahmasutra, Bauddhamata are repeated all along, which had been discussed in pages and pages of renowned writers of history of Indian Philosophy and Indian Religons and Indian Literature and Sanskrit Language. We are touching here and there to put forward our flashing ideas like putting an elephant in a nutshell.

  

I may just add that whether Rama and Jabali lived in Tretayuga discussed the points of Gautama Buddha (to be born in Kali Yuga) or preceding it (consider buddha is considered an avatara of Vishnu) later than Rama in order. If this can be accepted, then there certainly is the indication of later interpolation to add the name of Buddha among the Nastika- discussion found in the context. Whether we consider Rama as historical legends hero or hero of the epic (mythology), this question raises some doubt about the originality of the source.

  

And to add to this, Ashoka is also defended to be two personalities with identical names. One Ashoka the Mauryan king, who fought the Kalinga war (found in the inscriptions) and the other one who spread Buddhism beyond in Inida. I had read this fact in some webpage discussing the date of Sri Sankara.

  

Now coming to the point in discussion whether Sanskrit borrowed from Prakrit or Prakrit borrowed from Sanskrit the words common for both. There are two streams of though among the scholars of Indology on the relationship of these two.

Without going into the discussions on both the sides, I have quoted the relevant portion of the article on Prakrit languages. The emphasis on the point is that according one group, praak-kritam or prakritir eva prak.rtam with both these etymologies of the word praak-k.rita the earliest form of both Vedic and classical sanskrit from which the refined language saMs=kruta is derived. This is supported by the linguists also.

  

On the other hand, Indian school of thinking, believe prakRitiH = saMskRutam, tatra bhavam praak-kRitam Praakrit language is a later form stemmed from SaMskRutam. Sanskrit grammarians also consider Samskruta and Prakrita at par excellence for rhetorical reasons. Agnipurana quoted earlier by me, clearly states Sanskrit is the language of Gods, daivI vAk and PrAkkruta is the language of human beings.

  

This is the gist of the two schools of thinking. Now, to claim SanAtana dharma is the origin of all dharma-s is another point of view concurrent with the claim that Sanskrit is the mother of all the language is currently prevailing among scholars and this school nullify the theories of Indo-Aryan and proto PIE as imaginary and dismiss with them.  
  

Within our group, we have to be careful not to make any overstatement or over emphasis on any aspect. This is my humble opinion and other members are free to differ from this view.

  

And, the examples quoted by Abhyankar are not correctly translated into Sanskrit. The concurrent existence of these two languages always make it feasible for exchange of words and even grammatical structures and need not be due to one predating the other or otherwise.  
  

Scholars expert opinions are always welcome in this regard.
