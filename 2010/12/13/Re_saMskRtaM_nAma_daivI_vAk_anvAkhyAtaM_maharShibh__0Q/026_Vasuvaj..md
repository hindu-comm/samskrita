Namaste

Tathaa api mama abhipraayam prakatikartum vaancchaami.  
Vimala Sharma mahaabhaagaayaah patrasya etat vaakyam aham sampoornatayaa angikaromi:  
  

There should be tolerance between all religions and the destruction of the Babri mosque cannot be justified by anything written in any dharma.  
  

------  
  

I fully agree that destruction of any religious buildings cannot be justified by anything written in any dharma.  
  
Destruction and construction of structures in the same place is also not justified by anything written in any dharma:  
  
We just cannot justify the following structures:  
  

**Qawwat al-Islam Mosque ,**

**Hammam Darwaza Masjid  
**

**Jami Masjid at Ghoda in the Poona District of Maharashtrat Jaunpur ,  
**

**Mosque at Qanauj ,  
**

**Jami (Masjid) at Etawah ,  
**

**Mosques of Alamgir ,  
**

**Masjid at Manvi in the Raichur District of Karnataka ,  
**

**Jami Masjid at Malan, Palanpur Taluka, Banaskantha District of Gujarat ,  
**

**Gachinala Masjid at Cumbum in the Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh,......**

**  
**

**..... the list goes on and on.**

  

**Itopi adhikam jnaatum icchati chet krupayaa etat jaalaputam pashyatu:**
