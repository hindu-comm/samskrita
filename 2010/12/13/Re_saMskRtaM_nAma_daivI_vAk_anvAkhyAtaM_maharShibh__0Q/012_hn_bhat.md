Thanks for all the scholars who contributed to the history of Sanskrit Language and Literature throwing light on the development and script.

  

A question was raised by Abhyankar needs to be drawn attention. If Ramayana, considered by Indian Tradition as the Aadikavya, the first classical poetry (composed in Anushtup metre, differentiated from the Vedic compositions) is not considered as the earliest by the western scholars, what would be the date assigned by the western scholars at the latest? According to M. Krishnamachariar, the western scholars differ in dating fantastically from 13th - 14th century BC to 937 BC. and now our young scholar claims it to be too latest composition.

  

And, even if it is said to refer thestandardization of the language, Panini is not only the earliest Grammarian, as he himself refers to many earlier grammarians by name explicitly and implicitly.

  

Some more light can be thrown on the use of the word *samskrita*used in respect of language for the first time. Even brahmnins spoke Sanskrit purely in Yaga occasions, and otherwise used to speak the native or regional common language. "Yaajne karmani vai naapabhaashante" is a quotation from Mahabhashya. So "Dvijatir iva samskritaam" can be interpreted in both ways. Like the brahmin, speak sanskrit language or refined language.

  
  
धारयन् ब्राह्मणं रूपम् इल्वलः संस्कृतं वदन् / (54.1)  
आमन्त्रयति विप्रान् स श्राद्धम् उद्दिश्य निर्घृणः // (54.2)  
  
आमन्त्रय्विप्रतद्श्राद्धउद्दिश्निर्घृण  
भ्रातरं संस्कृतं भ्राता ततस् तं मेषरूपिणम् / (55.1)  
तान् द्विजान् भोजयामास श्राद्धदृष्टेन कर्मणा // (55.2)

  

Even if the quotation cited by Abhyankar is not enough to prove the use of the word in the sense of a language, the above two usages in the citation above from Ramayana itself, from Aranyakanda, would throw some light. The first of above two usages, seems to be used to Sanskrit language, as the context suggests and as per the quotation from Mahabhashya seems to suggest. Even if there is no unanimity of opinion regarding the date of the composition of Ramayana, here it seems to be the reference to the language. According to Indian tradition, it is the first poem and Valmiki is honoured by Indian traditional scholars as the first poet.

  

काव्यस्यात्मा स एवार्थस्तथा*चादिकवेः पुरा।*

क्रौञ्चद्वन्द्ववियोगोत्थः शोकः श्लोकत्वमागतः॥

  

as attested by Anandavardhana, the propounder of Dhvani school of Indian school of Criticism.
