Dear Sri Abyankar Mahodaya

Thank you for the link and the correction.

It is a very useful link.

Like Shakuntala, I am responding in the vernacular – English in this case, because it takes me time to compose in Sanskrit.



Going back to the original question re the date of the rAmayaNa, I guess this shows that that when this particular verse was written, Buddhism had spread and was becoming a threat (perhaps at the period of Asoka?).

I agree with Murthy-ji that **tathagata** and the word **Buddha** refer to the Sakymuni Buddha and not to “the intellectual”.

The verse is equating the Buddha to a thief “For as a thief, so indeed is the Buddha.........” perhaps because a Buddhism was making a lot of converts (stealing away the followers of Brahmanical religion and undermining the power of the priests)

“Now know the tathagata Buddha to be a nAstika”.

And also equating them to nAstikas (a philosophical movement which says nothing exists in the real sense – what the West would call philosophical idealism, as opposed to realism).



I thought it might be worthwhile to attach what we are responding to below so things are seen as a discussion and not as I an isolated comment. Sorry if I am violating any rules.



Over here, we all take a holiday this time of the year – so season’s greetings to everybody on this group.



Shubham

Vimala
