Vasuvaj Mahodaya

I was only commenting on what I had received from Sri Abyankar Mahodaya.

I fully understand what you are saying, one dharma has caused a lot of destruction because of their ideas about images, not only in India but also in Afghanistan, Persia and Central Asia.

You may be interested in film I saw recently called **Agora** set in ancient Alexandria – the same things happened but with other dharmas - Christians destroying the old deities of the Greek religion.

But this is now going beyond the scope of this group.



Best wishes for the New Year

Vimala
