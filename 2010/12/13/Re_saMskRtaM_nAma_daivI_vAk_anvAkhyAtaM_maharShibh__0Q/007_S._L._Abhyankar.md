नमो नमः श्रीमन् "अविनाश साठये"-महोदय !  
  
नूतनं ज्ञानं गम्यते भवतः निवेदनम् ".... BTW, if you are imagining that the name of the language became established by the influence of रामायण then it is not a very old reference. The book is considered to be a relatively late construction. ..." ।  
  
वाल्मीकि-महर्षिणः श्रीरामायणम् न प्राचीनम् ? इतिहासकाराणां मतेन कः अस्य काव्यस्य कालः खलु ?

  
सस्नेहम् ,  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः \|
