Do you mean the script or the language?  
The spoken language developed out of the vedic language which had an easier but more ambiguous grammar, and many monosyllabic words. Vedic in turn was related to Persian spoken at about the time of the KushAn empire. The classical Sanskrit language of the epics and kavyas developed after the grammar was regularised by Pannini maybe about the 5th BCE, and was spoken as Sanskrit by some strata of society at the same time as Prakrits were spoken by the majority, from the time of Pannini. In Gandhara where Pannini lived the Prakrit was gAndhArI, written in KharoSTI script. The word sam + kR means elaborated, well formed, etc. Monier Williams gives one meaning as a word formed according to accurate rules, a regular derivation (I am guessing that this refers the more elaborated grammar of Pannini). This means that this word was used to refer to the language after the time of Pannini. Not sure when this word was first used to refer to the language, but will get back to you on this (maybe in the Shiva sUtras thought to be written by Pannini?).

The devanagari script is thought to have developed from a precursor called siddhamAtRka which was written around 1000 CE which in turn developed from brAhmI thougth to have been developed by Asoka or his predecessors, which is turn is thought by Western scholars to derive from Aramaic and Phoenician. But equally brAhmI could be influenced by the Semitic scripts and not derived from it. The Indic scripts - KharoSTI and BrAhmI were the first scripts anywhere to use diacritical marks to denote the vowels following consonants - an innovation still used in all Indian scripts to-day, and makes the scripts completely phonetic.

Hope this helps
