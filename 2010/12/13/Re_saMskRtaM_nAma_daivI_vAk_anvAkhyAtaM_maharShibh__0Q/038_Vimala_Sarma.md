Hera Mahodaya

Yes of course Buddhism flourished outside India and continued to develop. The vaidikas were only interested in keeping maintaining
dominance in India. They were not concerned about China, etc. So history shows that they won. Regarding making him an avatar – this is a good way of sabotaging the power (or emasculating) of an opponent .
This brings it under the umbrella of Hinduism and Hinduism has assimilated many sects over the years. So what this is doing is telling people “You don’t have to be a Buddhist is believe in the Buddha – you can still be Hindu – he is just another form of Vishnu”. Of course this is just a bit of sophistry – the Buddha is not a deity and is not again reincarnated in any form. Since he is a perfected Being, he will not be re-born, so he cannot be an avatar of Vishnu. The Buddha rejects the authority of the Vedas, and the idea of the ultimate consciousness being Vishnu.
