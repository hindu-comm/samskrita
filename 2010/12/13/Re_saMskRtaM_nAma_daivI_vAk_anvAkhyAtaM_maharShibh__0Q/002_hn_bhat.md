Dear Friend,

  

When I wrote last, I didn't have the text of Kavyadarsha. It is very perfect qualification for Vaangmaya and not the reverse as you suggested to vaak. And that is how samskrita is used in general in neuter gender even without the noun to be qualified, but cannoted by the word.

  

Here is the precedent portion dividing Language into four types:संस्कृतं प्राकृतंअपभ्रंश andमिश्र used in literature. It isसंस्कृतं that refers to the preceding Vangmaya which denotes language in general speech. Svaarthe mayat. It is explained as the divine speech standardized by the sages (like Panini in Paaniniiya) and not the reverse.

  

It is better to go through the entire context before criticizing any text. Otherwise, such things would happen as posed by you.

  

I apologize for some inadvertent errors occured in my previous passage.
