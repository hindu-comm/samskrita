Dear Hera Mahodaya

After the development of the Mādhyamika school of Buddhism by Najārjuna – with the idea of sūnyata (non-existence) replacing realism (of all things), no absolutes including God (dependent origination), and the doctrine of no-abiding Self (replacing the eternal ātman), - about 5th century CE, - the Vaidikas fought back to defend upanisadic concepts.
There were several vārttikas (MW\_ the exposition of the meaning , of that which is said , of that which is left unsaid , and of that which is ill or imperfectly said )written. These texts were criticisms of Buddhist concepts using the system of philosophical dialectics developed by the Nyāya school. This sort of dialectics is also used by the Buddhists but developed into a unique form by Dinnāga. The position of the opponent is first put – called the pūrvapakṣa - and then this position is refuted using rules such observation (pramāṇas) and inference (pratyakṣa) and validating these by reference to the Vedas.
This was a very interesting time for Indian philosophy. The main work, Mimāmsā ślokavārttika, was written by Kumārila but there were others who followed in his wake, in including Adi Śankaracārya. There was also a healthy counter movement criticising the Vaidika schools, by Vācaspati Miśra. Unfortunately although this was a very interesting time intellectually, it led to Buddhism dying out in India, so I guess history has given victory to the vaidikas. However Buddhist thinkers such as Dinnāga, Najārjuna, Dharmakīrti and others contributed greatly to Indian philosophical thought, ontology, metaphysics and logic.

Many good wishes for the new year.

Vimala
