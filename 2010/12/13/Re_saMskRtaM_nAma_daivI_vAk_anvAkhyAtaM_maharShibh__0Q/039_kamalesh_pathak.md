sorry to interrupt you all,

Heeraji writes that Buddha was declared the 9th incarnation of Vishnu though he denied to honour the vedic concepts .

my thinking is that - during the rule of buddhism in india - some wise men had hadsome trickyidias to survive with hinduism - and for that reason may possible- they started to declare buddha as an incarnation of vishnu.

there could be another reason full of wisdom that resulted so powerfully that for atleast 18centuries the budhdhism disappeared from india and Adi ShankarAchArya within that era established the SanAtan dharma and advaitism and his work we all know were tremendous and beyond explanation today.

in india Buddism recently has reborned with perhaps Dr. ambedkar time known as nav bauddha,

 but

i am proudful towrite
here with the forum of

samskrit lovers that



the vedic concepts and vedic philosophy are highly and purely scintific,all time great.and genuine eco friendly, truly dedicated to naure in its most natural way, .



sorry i expressed my thinking but yet thinking that this is the right palce to say or to talk what i think about my favourite Samskrit the cosmo divinelanguage.



regards to all you elders,
