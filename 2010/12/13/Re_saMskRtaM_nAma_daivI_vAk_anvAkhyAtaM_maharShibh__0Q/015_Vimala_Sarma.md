Dear Murthy - Ji

Does it say mAtra and not matra in the last verse you cited?

“Know the tathagata (the way of the Buddha) to be only nihilism (believing nothing exists).”



sourAsthrAtrA – land of the sun-worshippers?

I guesss mlecca and yAvana refer to Greeks.

What about yavanakAmbojA – central asian?



The other names are places in India.
