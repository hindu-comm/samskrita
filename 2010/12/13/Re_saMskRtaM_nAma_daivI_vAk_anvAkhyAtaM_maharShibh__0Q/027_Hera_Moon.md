Dear All,



I am afraid I would rather not be led to believe that Vyasa and Valmiki predicted - as “darshanika” - future events and took stance against someone who came after them. Otherwise, just imagine the insurmountable difficulty with determining/guessing the dates of ancient scriptures! Therefore, I am rather comfortable with the guess that those passages were added at later dates for some understandable reasons. But this is only a personal feeling, not even an opinion.



Just for curiosity, if you don’t mind this small diversion (if you do, please be generous and ignore it):

Why was Buddha so negated? The essence of his teachings is, as far as I can discern, any bit deviated from the Truth spoken and shared by all sincere minds of all times. I personally like Buddha very much, especially because he negated himself as an absolute authority. He said, for instance, that we should not believe anything only because he said it unless it agrees with our own reason. Truth, if we do not understand it, would be indeed like a lamp to the blind. Buddha also said that we should work out our own liberation. And listen to this kind request of his: “Teach this triple truth to all: A generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion are the things which renew humanity.”



My deep reverence and love to all those nice people on the mailing list who live a life of service with generous heart and kind speech! I am lucky to find myself profiting from their selfless services. Thanks to them, my Sanskrit is improving and my spiritual horizon is broadening.



Hera
