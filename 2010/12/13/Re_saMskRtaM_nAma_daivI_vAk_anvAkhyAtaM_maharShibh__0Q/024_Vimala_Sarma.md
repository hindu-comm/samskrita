Dear Sir Abyankar Mahodaya

Thank you for your long e-mail. I appreciated getting it. It was good practise for me to translate it accurately.

Yes I agree that Valmiki could not have written those verses and that they are inserted later.

There should be tolerance between all religions and the destruction of the Babri mosque cannot be justified by anything written in any dharma.

I got a little confused re your discussion about the dates. Are you saying that the Ramayana was written at the time of the time of the Mahavira?

And that we got the formula “Om nano.............” from the Jains?

Warm regards
