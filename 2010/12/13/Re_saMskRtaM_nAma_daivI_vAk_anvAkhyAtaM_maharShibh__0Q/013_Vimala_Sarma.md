Dear Group

The Ramayana is earlier than the Mahabharata and is considered the earliest epic to be written with shloka meter. Arthur MacDonald dates it about 500 BC, and says the older parts deviate from Panninean grammar. There were minstrel bards who sang songs telling stories of heros, battles, kings, famous sacrifices, and myths, such as the story of Rama before the whole epic was composed as a coherent story, by Valmiki. These wandering bards, called sUtas, sang in Sanskrit. Much later in the time of the Mahabharata, they were looked down upon (as we know from the story of Karna) and identified with chariot drivers.



Sanskrit was originally used by a ruling and cultured class of people – this does not necessarily mean Brahmins spoke it, but more likely what we would now call Ksatriyas and wealthy people who formed the audiences who went to see drama. Brahmins continued to used the older Vedic chants in yajnas.

Thanks for all the scholars who contributed to the history of Sanskrit Language and Literature throwing light on the development and script.
