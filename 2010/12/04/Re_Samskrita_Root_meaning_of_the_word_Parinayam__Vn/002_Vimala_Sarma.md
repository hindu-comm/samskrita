Dear Balu Mahodaya

The word is from the root nī to lead, with the prefix pari (around); hence parinaya is “a leading around” referring to the groom leading the bride around the fire in seven steps.

Details on conducting the ceremony is found at
<http://www.ehow.com/how_4344_hindu-wedding.html>; and <http://www.srimatham.com/marriage-south-indian-ceremony/>

The [www.srimatham.com](http://www.srimatham.com) site gives instructions on how to conduct the ceremony as a purohit.

Shubham, blessings and good wishes on your marriage.

Vimala
