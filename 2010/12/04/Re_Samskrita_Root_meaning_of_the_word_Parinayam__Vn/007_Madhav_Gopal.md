Dear Mr. Balu Motukuru,



Congratulations on your marriage! Now we couldunderstand the etymological meaning of the word parinay as scholars have explaine it correctly. In my opinian, we should have a broader meaning of this great word and should not be just wandering "around fire". A marriage is a union of two souls and both parties should take an oath to lead each other's life reciprocally towards achieving the higher objectives of life. Thus, by parinaya, we can understand that one has to lead his/her partener's life wisely, in the best possible way to make his/her life easier and successful, rendering him/her to achieve all the puruShaarthas of life.



Wish you again a pleasant/happy/successful married life. Do your duties correctly.



With best wishes,

madhav
