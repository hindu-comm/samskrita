The word Parinaya comes from Agni Parinayana which is going round the fire as an essential part of the marriage ceremony. Other words which mean marriage are Vivaha(which comes from the dhatu Vah- to carry referring to the travel to her husband's home), Udvaha, also from the same dhatu, Panigrahana( Holding the hand of the bride by the groom) and Upayama(Bringing one closer).
