Dear Mr Balu,

the word pariNaya (wedding, marriage) is from the verb pari-Nayati. pari- means around (like peri- in Greek words: peri-pheral, peri-meter...) and the root nî (pres. nayati) means to lead. So the meaning is: leading around. This refers to leading the bride around the fire in the wedding ceremony. At this point, the deeper religious sense of this ritual can be explained by Hindu paNDita much better!

namaste,

Piergiorgio Muzi
