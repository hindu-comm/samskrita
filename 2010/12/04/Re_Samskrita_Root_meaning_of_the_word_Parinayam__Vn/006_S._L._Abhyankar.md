Dear Mr. Balu Motukuru,  
  
Your prompt for raising the question seemed to be "... so that I can perform my duties well, as a grihastha".  
You were game for learning from resources in other languages as well.  
I understand that the three sections in TirukkuraL have the titles "arattuppaL" "poruTpaL" and "kAmattuppaL" In turn, they dwell upon aspects of अर्थ धर्म and काम respectively.  
Does that become a consummate treatise on leading one's life most appropriately ?  
I guess, you are well-versed in TamiL also. Please enlighten.  
I think TirukkuraL have been translated in many, many languages, including Sanskrit.  
  
It also comes to mind that नीतिशतकम् and शृङ्गार-शतकम् by भर्तृहरिः also make a good summary on aspects of धर्म and काम Possibly नीतिशतकम् covers both अर्थ and धर्म This way भर्तृहरिः also covers all three aspects of अर्थ धर्म and काम  

  
सस्नेहम् ,
