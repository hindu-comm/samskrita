Namaste



To all the knowledgable members of the group, please let me know the root meaning of the word 'Parinayam' (marriage) and what individual root words constitute it.

I also would humblylike to seek all your wishes and blessings as I am going to get married on December 25th of this year. (Other than Samskrit, sources in English and Telugu are also welcome as i have the ability to follow text in those languages too)

Can you also let me know some good sources which explain the fundamentals of marriage in hindu tradition which I would like to read so that I can perform my duties well as a grihastha.



Thank you All

Balu
