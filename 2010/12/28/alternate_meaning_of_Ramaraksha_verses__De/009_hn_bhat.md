Certainly there are rules set for compound formation and compounds which are not compliant with the rules for some or other reasons, but established by usage are called asamartha-samasa. The relation between the compound words are dependent on their mutual expectancy. If they are not expectant of the other word, they could not be compounded. This is the common rule for compound formation without any specific classification. When the compound word can be interpreted following this expectancy rules (as explained by Panini) by complying with two or more category of compounds, (either bahuvirhi, tatpurusha or otherwise), it depends on the interpretation needed. As a general rule for composition, such compound formations (liable for bahubrithi and karmadharaya) with two words should be avoided (expectionally those established by usage like pitambara etc.). The second factor deciding the interpretation is the context. This is also has been accepted as a general maxim "abhidhaana-lakshanaa hi krittaddhita-samaasaah" primary and secondary derivatives and compounds are to be interpreted according to the contextual expectancy. (which has to be proved with testimonies warranting such interpretations). This can be efficiently used by expert commentators as quoted by your example, but for others it is better to follow the rules set by Panini. Otherwise, we should be ready to provide support from related literature or shastra in support of our interpretation, beyond the purview of vyakarana warranting such interpretation.

  

But you have done nothing in your interpretations of baddha-padmasana, and it doesn't mean anything for me in the present context of discussion without your explanation.
