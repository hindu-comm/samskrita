Is there any rule how a Samasa should be interpreted if it can be interpreted in two ways?  
  
Padmasanen Badhdha v/s (set in) Badhdha Padmasan wakes up my old curiosity about an old question in my mind.  
  
Pandit Bhaskar Ray (who wrote on Lalita Sahastranam) referred Nirukta in support of his support of his interpretation of GanaNath as Ganan Atha (Hence Laxmi/ Devi) instead of Gananam Nath (which is popular)  
  
What could have been those principles?
