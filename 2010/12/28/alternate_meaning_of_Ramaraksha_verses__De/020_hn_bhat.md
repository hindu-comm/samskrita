I still unable to follow your explanation, even with translation. For grammatical reasons, you cannot explain the compound "bahuvrihi" which is dependent normally on some other object to be qualified by it. In other words, a "bahuvrihi" compound can be an adjective word, and cannot be a substantive and as such it cannot act as a subject of a sentence, even if you want it to be one. Exceptional are the cases, पीताम्बर, लम्बोदर etc. epithets popularly used as epithets in respect of a well-known object or person as proper name.

  

Now, to interpret as you have translated, it needs some or any proof from grammar or any other field. That is why I said in the very beginning, I could not follow your analysis. All the grammatical explanation as offered by Naresh is absolutely acceptable to Sanskrit grammar and I can get the sense only related to Rama according grammar and also by sense. If it is not related to Rama, it should be an independent word in the nominative and in neuter gender only it can be in the nominative.

  

Even if you are trying to explain it in your own way, though not permitted by the Sanskrit grammar, (which I wanted support of grammar for your interpretation), it is highly improbable that a dhyana-sloka which is meant for providing a clear image for facilitating meditation (dhyana) on a concrete object, should contain a totally inconsistent part in it making it difficult for the the people practicing meditation to get a clear image. It is not a Sutra-style, but a beautiful piece of poetry describing a posture of Srirama's image.

  

And to solve the problem raised, some other means should be tried.
