Still I cannot follow your analysis. What do you mean after all with your analysis by isolating the compound from the rest of the words related with dhyaayet? Naturally all the adjectives in the verse are applicable to Rama who is the direct object of the verb dhyaayet. There is a rule that you can supply verbs "to be" if a nominative could not be related to any other predicate by proximity (which is the overlapping rule for all the grammatical restrictions).



Well, waiting for your further explanation.

  

Yet I can suggest one more thing. Baddhapadmaasanastham as an adverb in the bahuvrihi, can be related with the verb "dhyaayet" if you want it to interpret the compound as: Seated in padmaasana, one should contemplate on Srirama, ... .... etc. which could solve in a way the problem, but this formation too needs some relaxation from the rule of proximity. baddhaM padmaasanaM - baddhapadmaasanam, padmaasane tishthati yasmin karmani, i.e. or sthaa = position yasmin karmani, = i.e. the act the verb (of contemplation) in which one is seated in padmaasana. This too distorts the compound to some extent from its simple interpretation.

  

With regards
