Dear HN Bhat Mahodaya,  
  
Where is the above interpretation of Bhaskarji grammatically incorrect? If u replace baddhapadmaasanathaM in the actual verse by baddhapadmaasanathen, then doesnt it indeed become what Bhaskarji suggested? I am asking because I am a novice in grammar!  
  
Pranaams,  
Jaideep
