Dear Vimalji,

  

Thank for your kind reply and notice of the Hindu Time link.

  

Here is online version of T M Burrogh's Dravidian Etymological Dictionary which I hope should help you in your purpose. I think Caldwell's Comparative Grammar won't be of much help. It is also available online. If you cann't find it, I can provide the link too.

  

Here is the Etymological Dictionary which is still being revised by an Institute in Hyderabad for the revision of etymology given originally:

Here are two links for Telugu etymological dictionary:

Regarding the second point raised in your message, I am starting it as a new topic.
