I had already pointed out this difference with images produced for the above two postures. The issue in question is not the grammatical status or the yogic posture, but how it would be possible to have Sita seated
(literally climbed) in his vAmAMka (left lap) if any of the postures are strictly observed by RAma as shown in the image. This necessitated the alternative explanation and any further suggestion to solve or solution to the problem is welcome indeed. Grammatically both are possible.

  

With regards
