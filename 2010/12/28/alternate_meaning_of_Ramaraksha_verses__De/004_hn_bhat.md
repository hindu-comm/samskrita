Mm. Vimalaji is nearer to the sense. The problem is that "baddha-padmasana" is a variety of "padmaasana" a variety of Yoga-aasana-s. Here is the posture of baddha-padmaasana as such:

collected from a page, and with position, it is impossible for Sita to be seated in his left lap. Vaamaanka which necessitated the alternative translation. Now, following your explanation, it seems to be possible as in the padmaasana yoga-posture (regular one) and the compound simply means seated in padmaasana:

See the image, and think whether it would be possible for Sita to be seated on his right lap. The problem still back on its track. But imagine without keeping his arms on his knees, he is keeping one arm around her shoulder instead and holding the arrow and bow in the other, it may be possible to accommodate her on his lap even while sitting in the posture. So even if he is seated in padmaasana, as shown in the image, he cannot carry arrow and bow in his hands as they are not free. Without such a solution, the alternative explanation offered seems to be far from lexical and syntactical contingency as he has given:

> वामाङ्कारूढसीतामुखकमलिमल्लोचनं = he is worshiping वाम ( = शिव) and > अङ्क ( = अग्नि) and his eyes are fixed on the सितामुखकमल ( = > अग्निकुण्ड)

In my opinion, such alternative explanation may be acceptable from tantric point of view, but syntactically and lecal meanings don't seem to make a sensible meaning from his translation.
