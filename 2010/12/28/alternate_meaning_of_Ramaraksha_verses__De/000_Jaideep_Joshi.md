Namo NamaH !  
  
I recently read an interesting alternative meaning of the "dhyan" part of Ramaraksha. The verses are:  
  
अथ ध्यानम् ।  
ध्यायेत् आजानुबाहुं धृत शरधनुषम् ।  
बद्धप्द्मासनस्थम् ।  
पीतं वासो वसानं नवकमलदलस्पर्धिनेत्रं प्रसन्नम् ।  
वामाङ्कारूढसीतामुखकमलिमल्लोचनं नीरदाभम्।  
नानालङ्कारदीप्तं दधतमुरुजटामण्डनं रामचन्द्रम्॥  
इति ध्यानम् ।  
  
the literal meaning is: meditate upon one whose legs reach his knees, who is holding bow and arrow, who has worn yellow cloth, whose eyes compete with even newly blossomed lotus petals, on whose left lap is Sita, and who is looking at her lotus face, whose colour is blue like a cloud, who shines with several jewels, on whose head are the jataa, such Ramachandra.  
  
The author of the alternative translation said that since this is a dhyanamurti, it must describe a single aspect. Hence, while being in padmasana, it is impossible that Sita is on his lap, and holding bow-arrow, etc. His translation was roughly as follows:  
  
धृत शरधनुषम् = he is sitting on शर ( = grass), his hands are धनुस्, (= 4 arms long)  
वामाङ्कारूढसीतामुखकमलिमल्लोचनं = he is worshiping वाम ( = शिव) and अङ्क ( = अग्नि) and his eyes are fixed on the सितामुखकमल ( = अग्निकुण्ड)  
नीरदाभम् = because of the fire, his complexion has become blueish grey  
नानालङ्कारदीप्तं = his hair, which has come over his shoulders also, is shining like several jewels  
  
At first sight, I was not very convinced of this translation. Is it correct??
