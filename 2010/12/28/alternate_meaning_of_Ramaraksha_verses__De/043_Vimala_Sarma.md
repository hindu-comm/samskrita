Dear PaNDitAH

Could someone please give me a link to a good on-line Telugu-English and English-Telugu dictionary which has input in Roman letters and which will give meanings of colloquial spoken forms including verb conjugations? I would like to translate Annamacharya songs and jAvalis.



Could someone also give me link to a PAlI dictionary with the same features. I am doing some translations from Milinda PaHNa (Questions of King Milinda).



Any help gratefully accepted.

Happy New Year

Vimala
