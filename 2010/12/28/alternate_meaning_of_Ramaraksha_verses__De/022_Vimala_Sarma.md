Dear Bhat Mahodaya

I am sorry but I am also not clear on what you are saying. What I am saying is baddhapadmāsanastham is accusative masc singular, isn’t it? It is second vibhakti, sing masc. Like rAmam. It is not a nominative phrase. The grammar could indicate that one is meant to meditate on this stance. But we know from the sense that this cannot be the case.
The lotus position is well-known position in which to meditate.
Therefore it is not the object of the only verb in the sloka, which is dhyAyet so I am simply suggesting a another verb which is understood for this phrase. This verb has the nominative subject 3^(rd) person singular. So it is “(one should be) baddhapadmāsanastham”. In my analysis I am saying the whole phrase cannot be a bahuvrihi of Rama.
It is not Rama who is sitting in this position.



If the whole compound is to be taken as upapada compound then it would end in the verb root (baddhapadmāsanasthA) one who is seated in lotus position. Other examples are svayambhU or pankhajA.

What is the other problem?

Anyway I think I will stop contributing to this thread in case it may be thought that I am muddling things further.

Vimala
