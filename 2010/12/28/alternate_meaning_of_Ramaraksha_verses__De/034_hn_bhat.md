Dear Jaideep and Bhaskar,

  

If you are novices to grammar, better not to enter into discussions on serious grammatical problems without forming a grammatically correct sentence in Sanskrit and without studying the nature of the problem raised. First learn the rules of grammar properly and then ask questions if you cannot solve any problems you have.

  

Still I will try to convince you in my own way why the above interpretation is incorrect. If you know that there are two voices as in English - Active or Passive kartari and karmani prayoga. Each have their own rules. It is common sense and general to any language with similar grammatical structure. The subject of the verb should be in the nominative and the verb also should be in active voice.(the form differs in Sanskrit for both). Either *baddhapadmaasanasthaH dhyaayet*or *baddhapadmaasanasthaM dhyaayet* would be correct in the active voice. because the verb is in the active voice. In the passive voice, it would be *baddhapadmaasanasthena dhyaayeta*

and the in the passive, RaamaH the karma or object will take nominative and the agent of the verb will take instrumental as you can see in the immediately highlighted sentence above.

  

Without following the grammar, any other structure would not be acceptable. And further, this is not class room to teach the rules of grammar, but a discussion forum. For learning purpose, the member Abhyankar has been presenting lessons in his own way. Please go through it.
