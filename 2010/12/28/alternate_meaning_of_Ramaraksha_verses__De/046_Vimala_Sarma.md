Thank you Bhat Mahodaya and Kattamuri GAru

I think I have the same book on Annacharya songs – it is published by TTD?

This gives a loose English translation of the songs line-by-line

As I am choreographing to these songs I need a word-for-word translation so that the mudras and expressions are right for each word.



On another topic – I think everybody on the group will be interested in this timeline. Please see attached.

It is very optimistic about the role of India in the future! See last two entries.

It has a South Indian perspective but calls Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan a “Tamil pantheist” (pantheist is spelt wrong in the entry). They are wrong on both counts. He is not a Tamil (in spite of what his name sounds like!) nor was he a pantheist.

He was Telugu but lived in Chennai after his stint at Presidency. He was, of course an eminent philosopher, excellent writer, as well as having other distinguished careers. See entry 1888.
