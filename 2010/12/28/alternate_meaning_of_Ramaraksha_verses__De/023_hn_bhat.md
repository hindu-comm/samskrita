The highlighted portion I could not agree. As a bahuvrihi compound, it is the adjective for Rama who is the object of the verb "dhyaayet". One should meditate upon Rama, and other are only adjectival phrases or compounds as the case may be. There is no need to separate *baddhapadmaasana*and trying to relate it in vain with the predicate which you seem to have understood from the above highlighted portion.

Now, no problem in accepting the compound baddhapadmaasanastha as adjective to Rama and not(baddhapadmāsanasthA). ending with short "a" and not long one and in the accusative case.

  

I am sorry I didn't understand your proposition correctly. There was somewhere some misunderstanding of communication or gap between messages. I apologize for it.  
  

Please continue and don't stop.
