Mm. Vimalaji,

  

I am sorry I can't follow your mathematical formulation and understand it unless you translate the same in Sanskrit syntax for the compound with the same words.

  

But it seems that the Srirama in Bhadracala as in the image:

Can you apply your analysis to the image provided with vigraha-vakya provided in Sanskrit?

  

Is he seated in padmaasana or variety of it called baddhapadmaasana (or any posture as in the image provided here)? Any help from members is welcome. Anyhow, Sita is seated on his left lap and other things dhritasharadhanusham and other details in the verse is to be verified by all the members. 

  

Thanks to ramakrishna for providing the image helping the dicussion. Now remains some definition for padmasana or baddhapadmasana to suit the posture of Srirama in the image. The image is somewhat similar to the description if not identical.

  

I would like Mr.Ramakrishna to provide the dhyanashloka for the Srirama of Bhadracala as depicted in the picture, if possible.,
