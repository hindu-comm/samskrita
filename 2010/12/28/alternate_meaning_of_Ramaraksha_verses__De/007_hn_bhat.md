Dear Vimalaji,

  

Indeed, it can mean left side (of the body; that is the left side of the body above the hip; flank = The side between ribs and hipbone) and woman carry their children. This seems the meaning given in BY MW also. If it is left side of his body, location by his left side (as you suggest) or the left side of his body, THEN also Sita cannot aaruh = climb upon his side like we carry the children. The other way will be that she is standing, in which case, Rama should see upwards even if she is standing and he is sitting. And, otherwise, she also should be sitting on the ground by his left side, which also doesn't make much convenient position for him to glance into her face.

  

The problem remains still in the same track.
