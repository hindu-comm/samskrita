Here is my analysis

Baddhapadmāsanastham

1. Baddha + padmā + āsana + sthā

A + B + C + D

B is qualifying C (this is now to be taken as one single element E meaning lotus-position), C is describing D ie position of the lotus in yoga: second member of this type of compound (tatpuruṣa) is more important than first.

2. So now we have A + E + D

A is qualifying E (E is more important - as this now principle. What kind of lotus-position? – baddha kind of lotus position) This is now one element – F

3. So now we have F + D

F is qualifying D (what kind of stance does one assume? Baddhapadmāsana type of stance, again this is genitive tatpurSa)

Finally we could take the whole phrase to refer to something else because the ending is masc accusative singular - stham– what else is masc accus singular? –If we take the whole as a bahuvriddhi, it is the object of the verb in optative mood dhyāyet – he should meditate (on object) but the sense is referring to how a person should meditate so we can end the analysis at step 3.

Schematically represented: \[{A (B+C )} D\]

So you see that we are taking the last member of the compound as the principle word and working backwards. But in other compounds like dvandvas all members are equal and you can get A and B and C and D etc.



Other members of the group – please feel free to correct my mistakes.
This is also a learning exercise for me!
