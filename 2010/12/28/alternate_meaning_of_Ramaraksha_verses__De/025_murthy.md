I would do vigraha of baddhapadmaasanam as follows: baddham padmaasanam baddhapadmaasanam, tasmin sthitaH (sthIyate anena iti)baddhapadmaasanasthaH, tam. Here "baddha" is somewhar redundant and could as well be missed without loss of meaning. The poet would have added it to meet metrical requirements.

Regards

Murthy
