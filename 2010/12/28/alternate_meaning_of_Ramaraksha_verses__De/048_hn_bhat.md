=============================

  

Regarding Radhakrishnan, S I have a high opinion. But I see some extreme modern expounders of Hinduism do not accept him as the philosopher for some or other reasons. But I learnt about Indian Philosophy through his monumental work Indian Philosophy and the History of Indian Philosophy of Dasgupta. They are condemned for following western time line which is not acceptable to Indian standard astronomical configurations of yuga, pralaya, and kaliyuga.

  

He is respected as the Great Teacher and his birthday is still celebrated as Teacher's day which was objected to in some other forum as it is against Guru Purnima (of Indian Tradition), the supposed birth day of Veda Vyasa when I proposed this.

  

But you are right in assessing his nativity he is a Telugu native and not Tamil origin.*Sarvepalli*is a village in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, India. And about pantheist, he is advent admirer of Advaita philosoplhy, in spite of recording the contents of all the philosophical systems, but not certainly pantheist (which should not be mistaken with harmony of multiplicity of concepts).

  

Instead, the vikipeadia entry correctly assess him:

The highlighted portion of vikipedia entry might have led to call him a pantheist, in fact scholar of comparative philosophy and religion.

  

More can be expected pros and cons to this view, which is only natural in a discussion in a public forum.
