namaste Shri Bhat mahodaya,  
  
Here is one dhyaana-shloka that I know.  
  
vaamaa.nkasthita jaanakii parilasat kodanDa-danDam-kare \|  
chakraM chordhvakareNa baahuyugale shankhaM sharaM daxiNe \|  
bibhraaNam jalajaata patranayanaM bhadraadri mUrdhni sthitaM \|  
keyUraadi vibhUshitaM raghupatiM saumitriyuktaM bhaje \|\|  
  
It does not refer to the padmaasana/baddhapadmaasana of shrii-raama, as the picture shows, though it has similar "spirit" as you pointed out. Perhaps there could be other dhyaana-shlokas which explain the padmaasana of the diety in bhadraachalaM.  
  
Also, I have been told by a scholar that the dhyaana-shloka for a stotra is different for a description of a mUrti. The latter needs to follow aagama-shaastra-s, while the former has no such rules.  
  
praNAmaH  
Ramakrishna
