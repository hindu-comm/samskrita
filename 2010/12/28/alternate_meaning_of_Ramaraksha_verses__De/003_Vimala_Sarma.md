Dear Jaideep Mahodaya

Sorry for this small change, but I think I would translate it thus. It seems to be written in sUtra style – very compactly, with long bahuvRhiHs



Now (to explain) meditation

(One) should meditate with fore-arms supported on knees, sitting in the Buddha lotus position.

(Meditate) upon the yellow-cloth dressed one, whose the eyes are like the petals of a newly-(bloomed) lotus

(Who has) elevated on his left side, sIta, whose lotus-face meets the eye; (who is) cloud clouded

(Who is) radiant with varied decoration, (his) wide topknot bearing an ornament; (Meditate upon) Ramachandra,

This (or such) is meditation!



(Sita is positioned such that her face is at eye-level to Rama – I think this is what is meant ).

This translation may not be absolutely correct either but I think it is nearer the sense of it.

I don’t think there is a half p in बद्धप्द्मासनस्थम्

It should be padmA. Please check this.

Vimala
