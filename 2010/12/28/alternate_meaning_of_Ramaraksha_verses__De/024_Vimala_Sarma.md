Dear Bhat Mahodaya

I guess we can agree to disagree on some points. I have no problems with your views, but I have no more to add on this subject. In my analysis I used the letters A B CD to represent different members of the compound, A for baddha , etc. So maybe I did not explain this properly. This reminds of a discussion I had with Naresh Mahodaya some time ago about how students in the west are taught Sanskrit and grammar verses how Indian students are taught. There is bound to be a difference in how they understand each other.

Warm wishes for the New Year

Vimala
