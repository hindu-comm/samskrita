Dear Bhat Mahodaya

The verse is very concise. I think it is saying the meditator should sit in padmAsana and mediate on Rama, but it does say anything about position of RAma except that SIta on the left side and she is raised or climbed.

We are supposed to imagine this so it need not be too realistic.

But perhaps like in the bronze statues, Sita is given an elevated dias!
