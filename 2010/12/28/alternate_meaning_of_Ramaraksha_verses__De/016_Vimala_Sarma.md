Dear Bhat Mahodaya

The phrase baddhapadmāsanastham is not the object of the verb dhyAyet because it does not relate to Rama (I am getting this simply from the sense of it, not necessarily from the grammar), therefore we need another verb – the verb “to be” is the obvious one. This verse is written as an instruction with economy of words, so sometimes words are left out, and have to be supplied by the reader to make sense. A lot of traditional sUtras need commentaries to be understood correctly and there could be alternative explanations. My explanations may not absolutely correct.

So the whole translation of the verse:



Now (to explain) meditation

(One) should meditate with fore-arms supported on knees, on the one with bow and arrow

Be seated in the Baddha lotus (yoga) position.

(Meditate upon, the one who is) dressed in yellow-cloth, (whose) eyes are like the petals of a newly-(bloomed) lotus

(Who has) elevated on his left side, sIta, (whose) lotus-face meets the eye; (who is) cloud-coloured

(Who is) radiant with varied decoration, (his) wide topknot bearing an ornament; (who is) Ramachandra

This (or such) is meditation!



I sent a previous e-mail going through the steps of the analysis of the compound. Unfortunately I do not know Panninian terminology so this is the best I can do with my limited knowledge.

I hope this clarifies.
