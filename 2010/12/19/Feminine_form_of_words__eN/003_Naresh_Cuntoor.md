Dear Vishvas:

Siddhantakaumudi has a section called strI-pratyaya-prakaraNam. You  
may find it useful.  
Grammarians use ङीप् or टाप् to refer to theई and आ ending feminine  
forms respectively.

As far as चालकः is concerned, the pratyaya is ण्वुल् . In ण्वुल्  
pratyaya words, the feminine forms are चालिका, etc.  
There are some cases that are sort of exceptions: e.g., नर्तकः -  
नर्तकी .. Although the ण्वुल् counterpart is नर्तिका, its meaning is  
different from नर्तकी .. This is discussed in the शुद्धिकौमुदी book.

Best,

Naresh
