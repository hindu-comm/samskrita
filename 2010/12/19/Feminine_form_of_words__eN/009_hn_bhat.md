Dear all,

  

I am sorry I was not able to follow this discussion. As Naresh has suggested, there is a section in Siddhantakaumudi, and he proposed a Shuddhikaumudi to clear any doubtful cases. That seems to be wise idea. The other way is to refer to any Sanskrit Dictionary, which records the faminine forms in their derivative order from the stems and also from archaic forms used in epic and vedic texts. Monier Williams dictionary is useful one for the beginners from this point of view.  

  

Again I wish to remind of curtailing irrelevant portions from the message by retaining only relevant portion you are replying.

  

With regards
