Dear VishvAs Mahodaya

The adjective needs to correspond in gender and number to the noun it is describing. Your question made me think and I referred to Whitney. In most cases the feminine adjective ends with A like the sItA declension, but some situations it can take long i, I, ending like devI. These cases are listed in Whitney.

1. The cases where there is a secondary derivation and the a has turned to vriddhi form, such as Avasya from original avasya. Then the ending is I.

2. The cases where there is primary derivation the with –ana suffix, it also takes I, such as codanI (fem)

3. Primary derivatives in a with strengthening of root syllable – divAkarI (fem), but there are exceptions

4. Endings with –maya or –tana; which become mayI or tanI

5. Ordinal numerals – paNcamI

6. Some case both A and I endings are correct such as such as kevalA or kevalI.

Warm wishes

Vimala
