Dear All,  

1\. As regards trying to find out a rule which helps us in using the correct feminine forms (strI pratyaya) it is perhaps best to learn the way we learn usage in any other language. In English, we learn ox-oxen, child-children, book-books, copy-copies, toy-toys etc for plurals without looking for an underlying rule.

2\. I may not be wrong to say that it is only in Sanskrit that a coherent and cogent set of rules largely rules the territory of grammar. Even in Sanskrit, despite Panini’s great analysis, there is much that evades rules. After all, What Panini-and perhaps his predecessors- did was to list out various categories as much as possible and work out rules for each category. The various suffixes and prefixes used by Panini in –like DukRung- are a way of categorizing or listing. The ten gaNas in verbs are a way of listing.

3\. In passing, what Panini did was not to refine a language but to codify the grammar of an existing language. It would be quite wrong to say that Panini created “Sanskrit”.

4\. I believe the star of the day is in feminine as all 27 stars are wives of moon.

5\. If the day of the month is feminine-say pancamI-it is because it qualifies “tithi” which is feminine.

Regards

Murthy
