Good, informative reply - धन्योऽस्मि.

Your discussion of ‘honey’ and ‘bear’ bring to mind my recent completion of a course in Old English. The epic poem, ‘Beowulf’, means literally ‘honey-wolf’ = a bear. Interesting post! Thanks again.



"The Information Age offers much to mankind, and I would like to think that we will rise to the challenges it presents. But it is vital to remember that information - in the sense of raw data - is not knowledge, that knowledge is not wisdom, and that wisdom is not foresight. But information is the first essential step to all of these". **Arthur C. Clarke** (1917 – 2008)

Unfortunately no.  
  
Medvedev - literally translates to "of Bears". (med = honey and ved could be from the root meaning "manage or deal with"). This would be similar to having a name like Michael Bears, etc. It has nothing in common with Mahadeva.  
  
Taanyaa - is short-form derived from Tatiyana which is again derived from Latin Tatianus or Tatius.

Possibly one more common Russian name is Taanyaa. Would it be just a variation of Tanayaa तनया ?
