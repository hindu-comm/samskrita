Just wonderful derivations on similarities of words.

  

But it should be remembered that the similarities or parallelisms do not contribute by themselves to any hypothesis of the derivation of the words of one language from another. But only suggest parallelism which can be casual or accidental may or may not follow any regular phenomenon.

  

Without studying a wide range of such cases, it would be only a mere guesswork to highlight the indebtedness of one language to the other. It is always possible to borrow words from each other when interactivity between the languages are possible due to many natural, political geographical reasons. It is evident with the emergence of yavana-jataka, which has borrowed from or to Persian, Arabic terminology of Astronomy which could not at all be explained with Sanskrit Grammar. But guesswork can be made and some relation may be possible to be established. Similar cases may be possible in other sciences also. Many cases are there like the word. 

  

Thanks for all the endeavors of etymological search.
