Vasu, you are correct.  
  
  
In Russian MedVed stands for animal who is well educated about honey, apart from bees, (who are insects) there is just bear, who knows a lot about honey. Basically:  
  
Med=мёд=mead=Honey  
Ved=ведает=Sees, Knows  
  
Another word in Russian related to other old roots for bear is **place where bear sleeps at winter**:  
  
Berloga=берлога= Be(a)r+Loga  
  
Loga is form of other Russian word Logovische=логовище=Den (Haunt, Covert)
