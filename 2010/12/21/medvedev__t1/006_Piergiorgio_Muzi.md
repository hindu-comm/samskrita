Dear scholars,  
it is really risky and sometimes deceptive to base etymology on similarity  
of single words...KRSNa has nothing to do with OldGreek Christos and the  
verb gAti has nothing to do with the English verb to go..The OldGreek koitos  
is not the same as Lat coitus, even if they can have similar meaning (the  
first from keitai = Skrt shete and the second from (co)-eo = Skrt  
(sam)-eti ). In the middle ages they spelled the Latin word caritas as  
charitas (after this Engl charity!), since they identified it with OldGreek  
charis, but it is provable that there is no cognateness between these words.  
In the meanwhile dissimilar words may be cognate: a classical example is  
Skrt brahman and Lat flamen, Skrt heDa and Engl ghost (Germ Geist), Skrt  
huti (from ju-ho-ti) and Engl God (Goth Guth). But Skrt bhaga and OldSlav  
Bogu ( = God) are really the same word.  
To catch the cognateness of words it is essential to refer to general rules  
of correspondence depending of the evolution of the different languages from  
original Indo-European language. For instance Grimm's laws provides an  
important criterion to recognize whether a Sankrit, Latin, or Russian world  
is connected with a particular German item (so, for instance, Skrt pitar,  
Lat pater, OldGreek pater is Engl father).  
As for Sanskrit a good introduction is T. Burrow, The Sanskrit Language  
(Motilal Banarsidass Publ.).  
A useful framework to understand the historical evolution of Arian languages  
could be Szemerenyi's Introduction to Indo-European linguistics. But there  
are hundred of very serious books about this matter, since comparative  
linguistics is around two centuries old (ant it owns a lot to Sanskrit and  
Panini...). This is only for scholars and teachers who want to deepen the  
knowledge of the language, but everybody is curious about fundamental  
lexical cognateness with English can check English etymological dictionary,  
where very often the original I.E. forms are reported together with Sanskrit  
ones. So they would be surprised to see that English to go is the same as  
Skrt ja-hA-ti and Engl to come matches Skrt gacchati ( and Lat venio,  
OldGreek baino...). And this not because of any similarity, but thanks to  
rules of diachronic phonology. But neither Engl gate nor gait has anything  
to do with Skrt gatiH!!!
