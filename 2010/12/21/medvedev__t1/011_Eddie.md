On the subject of words, not to mention wisdom, let the master speak. For there is much to learn even of the basics, before one can presume to pronounce upon more learned subjects:



Patañjali III. 17



 Śabda-artha-pratyayānām itaretara adhyāsāt saṃkaraḥ tat pravibhāga-saṃyamāt sarva-bhūta-ruta-jñānam.



This is my understanding...



A word is a threefold entity. Each of the three having independent existence, can be found on their own.

1\. The word itself, spoken or written, in whatever language or script.

2\. The object, concrete or abstract, perhaps one that a man has yet to set eyes upon, for which there may not even be a word.

3\. A meaning. An idea/thought/image residing in the mind, which may or have a corresponding reality, let alone a word.



There are of course many one word sentences that carry plenty of meaning.



But in this context of III. 17, I am not clear as to the meaning of *ruta.*

A sound according to Monier-Willams, but does it exclude that of human creatures? In context it is the second specific Saṃyama. The first of which is clearly concerned with vision. The third, clearly that of inference. So does the author here refer to the mastering of hearing, following on from the mastering of the sense of sight.

I am disinclined to understand the more fanciful, albeit more entertaining, interpretation that the author is suggesting that we develop an ability to have meaningful conversation with such as birds or bees?
