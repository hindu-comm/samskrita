Hera,



But . . .

-what- are we to experience?

-how- do we to go about obtaining this mysterious experience?



In order to understand what Patañjali means, we have to recreate that mysterious experience for ourselves.

Fine. But no one seems to know what kind of ‘knowledge’ we are aiming to experience.



I can only conclude that, by listening intently to the creature sounds of the countryside, and trying to identify the creature responsible for the noise, I become a better farmer/shepherd or simply learn to better identify the usual suspect – wolves , crows, poachers?



What an articulate donkey has to bray about, would only be of interest to another donkey, or its herdsman.



There are and were, many such country dwellers around, who could usefully develop their sense of hearing - clairaudients wouldn’t need instructing!



In the desperate days of WWII, serious investigations were carries out into alternative means of communication for submariners, for example.



There is another, such a one being undertaken right now, by an international team of professionals organisations. It is into that commonly reported experience, had by those who have ‘died’ undergoing surgery on the operating table. That whereby their ‘spirit’ leaves the body , floats above all and sundry. They who later, having had their hearts shocked back into life, describe what they saw (and heard) in vivid detail.

The investigation entails the placement of eye catching items on shelves etc. above the level of sight of all below. . .



From saṃyamāt III. 16, I once made in a ‘field of activity’ that contained an (unplugged) TV set, I came to understand that my TV set was right-handed!

I’ve never really noticed that TV’s have handedness, before. But it was the Monty-Pythonesque thought of left-handed TV’s that brought about a fit of giggling, and disturbed my one-pointed state. And I just don’t giggle. Laugh yes, but never giggle.



Thanks for the entertainment, guys, but such explanations, require some justification before they can be upgraded from the realm of the purely speculative into the ‘meaningful’ category, via that of common-sense.
