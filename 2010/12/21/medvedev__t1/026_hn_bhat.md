Dear Friends,

  

I had no patience to go through all the replies to the original question. But it is evident that the question is raised on the meaning of Ruta रुत in the PYSIII.17 and the general meaning given in the lexicon and the roots list (धातुपाठ) point out only to sound in general रु शब्दे। the primary derivative participle रव also has the same generic meaning. But by usage, the word रुत or रुति is restricted to the specific sound of cry of animals and birds. Hera mohan's explanation is justifiable from this point of view also. And the classification of परा, पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा, वैखरी is available in Tantric texts and also texts on the philosophy of grammar (propounded by भर्तृहरि in वाक्यपदीय) and if we follow, Hence it is justifiable that the word रुत in this Sutra refers to the cry of birds and animals as explained by the commentators is in favor of the above explanation. And there is no intervention of physical sounds, as the Sutra explains the result of meditation on the analysis of words and their meaning in the language (of human beings in which a clear division of words and their meaning is apparently made available). The other sounds produced by human beings gesture, laughing, teasing, etc. would be inferable even without "saMyama" and even though word "bhuta" could include human beings, the other speculations of sounds may safely be excluded from the purview of the meaning of the word in the Sutra. This is generally explained by the commentators. I referred to Vacaspatimishra and Vyasa Bhashya which follow the philosophy of grammar and which is suggested by the technical term इतरेतराध्यास in the Sutra, which is the principal basis of concept of Shabdabrahma of Vakyapadiya.

  

I will refer to other commentaries of Nageshabhatta one more adventist in the philosophy of grammar (I mean Indian Grammar) and some others for further details from this point of view in my next message.

  

Anyhow, it is desirable to use transliteration encoding (in roman) or devanagari fonts to avoid misreading the word in the roman script (using the general spelling system) in the messages.

  

With regards
