Vidya,



==> Is this relevant to the original question?



Yes indeed.



Although I would place it under the previous group, ending with sūtra 16:



Patañjali III. 16 Pariṇāma-traya-saṃyamāt atīta-anāgata-jñānam.



Which would be concerned with the birds behaviour in general, whereas the noise would draw my attention in the first place, it would not be the central clue to the future situation.



Like many people I live on the coast, and the many seagulls occasionally exhibit unusual behaviour by noisily flocking overhead heading in an inland direction - quite some time before the occurrence of stormy weather.



But they also behave much the same way when chasing a swarm of flying insects – the insects being to small to be seen – however the successive changes in direction enable the two behaviours to be distinguish from one another - the coming of a storm (in the remote time) v the swarming of insects (in the remote distance). Knowledge of the unseen - to be derived, by close attention to to the seen. In the future it may be possible to implant a memory chip into the brain or some such, but for now it has to be obtained the hard way.



However, there is a twist. I am to understand the the object of that exercise, and indeed all such exercises, is not so much obtain to obtain knowledge, but merely to develop the power of attention - the raw resource used in obtaining it. The ability to attend, under the many different circumstances.

At other times, perhaps on the same playing fields, is where that ability comes into its own.



Power being an ability to do. But its just the ability. If never used, never called upon, all power however sourced, might just a well not exist.

But its there if and when needed.

And given the ceaseless demands on this particular resource, it is surely well worth harnessing.



harness:

 to bring under conditions for effective use;

 gain control over for a particular end:



Again, simply for effective use. Having been brought to that condition, its there, ready. How or when to use the resource so harnessed comes under the topic – wisdom. Peppered throughout the YS – if closely attended to ![Winking smile](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/98cebdcd37269c33/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile%5B1%5D.png?part=0.0.1) .



So still unresolved:

What particular ‘information’ is to be obtained via III 17, what kind of training ground/playing field are we listening to here?



Thank you all for your patience with this most abstract of topics.



Eddie
