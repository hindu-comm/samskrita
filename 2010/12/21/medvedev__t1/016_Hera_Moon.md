Dear Eddie,

In YS III.17-37, many different siddhis resulting from samyama are enumerated, e.g. sarvabhutarutajnana, purvajatijnana, parachittajnana, antardhanam..., depending on the object of samyama. Mr Muzi’s translation leaves nothing to be desired (perhaps except for ‘cries’?), as far as I can discern. Here is my attempt at a possible interpretation: as the para stage of communication occurs in the samyama state, communicating with birds and flowers, maybe a miracle for us who communicate mostly on the vaikhari level, is only natural for those who went beyond the pashyanti level, going supersonic, so to speak.

Best wishes,

Hera
