Well, it was reported during the 2004 Tsunami that a group of non-modernized natives in the Indian Ocean islands (Andaman and Nicobar, I think) escaped the worst of the effects by migrating inland, based on their capacity to interpret animal / bird noises. 

  

Is this relevant to the original question?  I do not know. But, this is to address the comment quoted above.
