Hera,



 Bhoja has a gloss on III. 17:



 Yad-rutam yaḥ-śabdas-tatra jñānam-utpadyate-na-eva-abhiprāyeṇa-etena prāṇināyam śabda sam uccārita iti sarvam jānāti.



His, prāṇināyam, would exclude flowers.



prāṇināyam:



 • m. a living or sentient being, living creature, animal or man, ŚBr. &c, &c. (also n., ĀpŚr.). \[706,1\]



And there’s his uccārita.



uc-cārita

 • mfn. pronounced, uttered, articulated, L.

 • having excretion, one who has had evacuation of the bowels, Gaut. Suśr.

 • (am), n. evacuation of the bowels, Suśr. \[173,2\]



No supernatural explanations required.



Anyway, flowers don’t do sounds.





Eddie



 PS. Does the man have a sense of humour, too?
