Piergiorgio,



 You have an amusing way of saying ‘I don’t know.’



Most people would understand that anyone endlessly sitting under a tree, dieting on nothing but figs, would have a rather jaundiced view of life.

There would be little joy or laughter to be had in such an ‘all’. All, would indeed be suffering!





My quest continues:



 What does ‘sarva-bhūta-ruta-jñānam/knowledge of the cries of all creatures' actually mean?



There is much sound practical advice encapsulated in this work. The product of centuries of research into the nature of existence.

Not, ‘What does it all mean?’ For that begs the question that there is a meaning. The focus is on the ‘it’, i.e. ‘life’.



Life, and how to best equip oneself to live It. A very full time job. Magic, is only resorted to when all else has failed!



There’s, more to life than figs!







Eddie
