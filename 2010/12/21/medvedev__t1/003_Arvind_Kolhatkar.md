I think these guessworks are in the same class as saying that  
Christianity was originally from India because it is nothing else than  
कृष्णनीति (LOL)!

The ev/ov endings in Russian surnames are like the preposition 'of' in  
English. Medvedev derives from medved (bear) which in turn is formed  
from  
мёдь म्योदь (मधु) and видеть बीद्येतь (विद्-वेत्ति) one who knows/  
sees honey. Does Yuri have something to say on this?
