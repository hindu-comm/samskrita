Dear Ms Eddie,

I'm reporting the sûtra 17 of Patnajali's Yogasûtra.

शब्दार्थप्रत्ययानामितरेतराद्यासात्सङ्करस्तत्प्रविभागसंयमात्सर्वभूतरुतज्ञानम्।

śabdārthapratyayānāmitaretarādyāsātsaṅkaras.

tatpravibhāgasaṁyamātsarvabhūtarutajñānam \|

As for ruta I share your doubts of interpretation. I would say: Patanjali used a word who can have more than the plain meaning of çabda or dhvani. That word has "weeping"as a main meaning together with other senses(the root is ru: rauti, synonymous of rud: roditi). I like to believe that this is a deeper meaning which expresses the point of view of vivekinas. That is samyama gives that kind of comprehension to understand that the uttering of all living beings is sort of weeping. Indeed, सर्वं दुःखं विवेकिनः।

I would translate the sûtra this way: Because of entanglement of object, meaning, concept (there results) a mixture (of them); thanks to samyama on their partition the knowledge of the cries of all living beings (is achieved). Since also English noun cry is ambiguous, and bhûtâni comprise humans and animals, we can maintain a multiple interpretation. Besides, there is no need to separate normal and paranormal sense of this jñâna. The interpretation is open to both, even if you know that all this chapter contains references to paranormal siddhi-s somehow. You can believe that this is only metaphor.

As for adhyâsa, the meaning is entanglement. In vedânta it is synonym of adhyâropa, that is superimposition, but here it is only sort a metaphor for intrinsic connection, so I prefer entanglement. Sankara is mixture (sort of cognitive complex, to be analyzed, disentangled).

I suppose that other interpretations could enrich and enlarge this mine or amend it, of course.

BTW, Patanjali, the grammarian (the same of Yogasûtra or an homonym of his) wrote about philosophical issues of semantics... This is not the time/place to talk about it...

Regards,

Piergiorgio Muzi
