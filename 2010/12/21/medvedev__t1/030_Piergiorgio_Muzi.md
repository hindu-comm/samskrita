Dear Eddie,

I'm happy that my way of saying "I don't know" has amused you. Usually this way annoys or saddens other people. Maybe my having been a psychiatrist and psychoanalysthasn't left only negative features, hopefully. But I can't say...I don't know.

Of course the matter can be treated shortly in an email conversation, but I want to express my perplexity about yourglobal interpretation of yogadarçana, as far as I have understood you. My criticism goes also to the attempt to interpret all meditation techniques as sort of psychotherapy. This is very common in Western world. And it matches the parallel tendency in philosophy of science and epistemology towards so-called "naturalization". It has many forms, but in the strongest one it is derived from neo-positivism and its ancestors. Naturalization was sort a "parole" inCarnap& Quine philosophy. And at present it is one of the Leit-Motiv of cognitive sciences, which are mymain field of study. My criticismis the same a K. Popper's or Th.Nagel's one, just to cite only twoinfluential thinkers.The transparent connection with modern secularismand atheistic proselytism is notorious. I believe that there is no "scientific" justification for a philosophy or life style, which is as old as Indian lokayata/cârvâka system or those Greek thinkers called "hoi physikoi" and criticizedby Plato...

If we consideryogasûtra, we can only see that itsessential theme is the opposite one. We have not to naturalize ourselves (purusa), but de-naturalize ourselves,though if ina natural way, since nature (prakrti) has this tendency in itself towards that aim...We know that there is something paradoxical in this system, as well asin more idealitisticdarçana-s (like vedânta and also Buddhism). Some logicians (G. Priest, for instance) have tried to give logically paraconsistent representation ofthe related limitof thought.

As for the problem of understanding what bees and cows and bats think and/or say, we can put the matter at different level of understanding, depending on what we aspire to. C. Lorenz succeeded better that Skinner in understanding the language of animals. A trained yogi could understand even better than Lorenz. I don't see a clear limit between normal and paranormal communication.Isn't there a branch of research called zoosemiotics? Apart from naturalizing yoga practice and theory, I suppose that this separation is strongly connected to the historical roots and policy of Western materialism (see: The taboo of subjectivity, ofA. Wallace).Certainly we can commit the "scientific sin" of anthropomorphization, but reification and even mineralization of living beings, including humans, is much worse: it's an essential mistake, it's ...avidya!

But this topic is too large and it's going astray from the interest in Sanskritlanguage of the group.

Thanks for attention and patience and amusement,

Piergiorgio Muzi
