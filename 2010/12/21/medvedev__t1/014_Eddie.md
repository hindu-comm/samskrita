Piergiorgio and all,



 Thanks for your reply, Piergiorgio.

(BTW, the Eddie is for Edward, so I am a he, not a she.)



Anyway, the real issue with this sûtra is its purpose: sarva-bhūta-ruta-jñānam.



Which, as you say, 'the cries of all living beings (is achieved)' is how it is generally understood.

This is the usual answer, which however leaves the slight problem as to what ' knowledge of the cries of all creatures' actually means.



In other words this is not an answer, its a non-answer! Better known as an evasion.



As for rud.

rud glosses as:

 'to weep, cry, howl, roar, lament, wail'.

 and refers to the entry for the verb ru.

 and its noun is rud.



ru is glossed as:

 'to make any noise or sound, sing (as birds), hum (as bees)'

and within its scope, I find

ruta, as a noun:

 any cry or noise, roar, yell, neigh (of horses), song, note (of birds), hum (of bees),



So I remain with the broader term. But you have given me to notice the ‘any cry or noise’. Which states simply -noise- and the qualifier -any-.

It does not even exclude inanimate 'noise'. The hum of bees is included and that is a sound, but made by their wings.



Also, I am beginning to realise, that I must exclude my 'written words'. 'Sounds' being very much the subject, here.



It is very difficult to to get even an approximation of the information encapsulated so tightly in these works, especially when we have no idea of the vocabulary, current to the author.

The internal consistency, suggests something very straightforward, but which over the distance of time has gained a stature of almost mythical proportions.



Eddie,
