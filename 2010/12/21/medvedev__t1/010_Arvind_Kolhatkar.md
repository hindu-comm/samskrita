Dear Group,  
  
Noticing similarities in words and grammar structures in disparate  
languages is not a 'past time' undertaken for amusement. To those  
curious to know how human groups in the remotest past lived together  
or migrated elsewhere, similarities in languages is one of the most  
important aids and is as much 'learning' as anything else.
