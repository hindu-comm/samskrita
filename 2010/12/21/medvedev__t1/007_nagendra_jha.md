Dear learned sanskrit scholars!

It is not justified to spend our time and energy for finding originality or similarity of words among may languages. As you all know, Word alone has no meaning inpractice unless it is used in sentenance.

So, it is better to enrich ourselves with sole meaning direct or indirectto enculcate the produce

Enjoy.

Regards.
