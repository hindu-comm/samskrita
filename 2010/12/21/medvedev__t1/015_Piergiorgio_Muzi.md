Sorry, Mr Eddie, for my ignorance of English personal names.

Admittedly, mine was a non-answer. If we found one single unambiguous interpretation, we should take it as the best. Otherwise, we could renounce the effort of interpretation and even consider the multiple interpretationasa possible hypothesis (this is not an unusual attitude as far as sapiential or mystical tests are concerned). There are inconsistencies at the examination of the lexical entry indictionaries!

I haven't thought of the extension to inanimate being's noise. A panpsychistic attitude is required, if we like... But also in this case,I doubt that there is a decidable answer, which is not arbitrary or extremely vague. You would say: a non-answer, like the one to a Zen koan...

Regards,

Piergiorgio Muzi
