Unfortunately no.  
  
Medvedev - literally translates to "of Bears". (med = honey and ved could be from the root meaning "manage or deal with"). This would be similar to having a name like Michael Bears, etc. It has nothing in common with Mahadeva.  
  
Taanyaa - is short-form derived from Tatiyana which is again derived from Latin Tatianus or Tatius.
