Thanks for both the observations.

  

Mr. Srinivasan I just quoted oft hand what I remembered. There may be some more examples and dialects of Sanskrit itself at the time when it was spoken in different regions. The regional difference of spoken words in the language is also attested in Mahabhashya itself. :

  

shavatir gatikarmaa kambojeshv eva bhaashito bhavati, vikaaram enam aaryaa bhaashante shava iti; Hammatih sauraashtreshu - raMhatiH pràcyamadhyeShu - gamim eva tu aaryàH prayu\`njate . daatr lavanàrthe pràcyeùu, dàtram udãcyeùu .

  

The above clearly shows there were dialectal differences. Whether Sanskrit was spoken at any time is one question and whether it was spoken as the lingua-franca of the society at any time is another question. And if not, whether it was restricted to a strata of the society or accessible to all the strata of the society is a diffrent question. Members have answered from different points of language as spoken at least till one thousand years ago. Still as it is a language, it can be spoken as an inter-active language between the speakers of different languages, is another point of view presently convenient one.

  

As for languages, Prakrit has been distributed into dialectal languages at the time of Natyashastra and there are many works in Indian Literary criticism and dramaturgy that deal with the classification.

  

I have no definite answers for the different points of the view from different angles.

  

Thanks for all participating in this discussion. I also agree with Vasuji, that it is better to present different points in different titles, than deviating from the original question raised. So that interested and knowledgeable persons can participate and contribute independently to the different views they are interested.
