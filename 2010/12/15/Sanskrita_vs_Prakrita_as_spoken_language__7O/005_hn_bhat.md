Dear Vasuji,

  

Thanks for making your query more clear and specific. Here is a context from Mahabhashya, during the discussion why Vyakarana should be learnt:

  

अथ शब्दानुशासनम्। केषां शब्दानाम्? लौकिकानाम्, वैदिकानां च। ....................................................

पुराकल्प एतदासीत्‌ ‘‘संस्कारोत्तरकालं ब्राह्मणा व्याकरणं स्माधीयते तेभ्य: स्थानकरणानुप्रदानज्ञेभ्य: तत उत्तरकालं वैदिका: शब्दा उपदिश्यन्ते, तदद्यत्वे न तथा । तथा वेदमधीत्य त्वरिता वक्तारो भवन्ति । वेदान्नो वैदिका: सिद्धा: लोकाच्च लौकिका: । अनर्थकं व्याकरणमिति तेभ्य एवंविप्रतिपन्नबुद्धिभ्योऽध्येतृभ्य आचार्य: प्रयोजनानि व्याचष्टे इमानि प्रयोजनानि नित्यमध्येयं व्याकरणमिति ।

  

Thus from the highlighted portion, it is clear that Brahmins used to speak classical Sanskrit. The students at a later time, were busy in life so that they could not find whole of Veda-s with the Six anga-s. And, so on completion of learning the Veda-s they are hurrying to get settled in life. Here by the context, the Paninian grammar deals with both Vedic and classical sanskrit words (and not any other words) and the words laukikaanaam in the later part of the discussion also refers to the same spoken form of classical Sanskrit and it seems that there is nothing to go against this assumption. By the time of the debate in the Mahabhasya at least, Brahmins were speaking Sanskrit. This makes us to take the statement in the simily found in Ramayana, quoted by Abhyankar:

  

द्विजातिरिव संस्कृताम्। also can refer to Sanskrit Language spoken by Brahmins (Ravana himself by birth Brahmin, grandson of the sage Pulastya) and it perfectly fits the occasion.

  

And in the story of Ilvala and Vatapi, the reference of Ilvala in the guise of a Brahmin, quoted by me in the other post, also suggests that Brahmins spoke Sanskrit. It may be the language of the higher classes by practice or as the ruling language accepted by the rulers from time to time, which may change according to the will and pleasure of the rulers. Anyhow, in practice, it was available to the higher caste people of the society. But this needs further investigation. But the conventions in dramaturgical treatises are based on the practice as the literature is expected to reflect the social customs in general. avasthanukritir natyam. which includes the languages in use also.
