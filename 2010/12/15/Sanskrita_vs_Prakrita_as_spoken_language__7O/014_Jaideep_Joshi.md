Dear group,  
  
It is my humble opinion that some of the mentioned points do not consider many recent discoveries, especially relating to Indus script. I recommend reading the book "decrypting the Indus ciphers" by S. Kalyanaraman.  
  
The following points from the book are relevant:  
  
1) the Indus script is in the language Mlecchita, which is the one used by artisans and smiths all over the country, \*and contains elements from all prakrit languages.\*  
  
2) There is continuity in india's linguistic traditions throughout the development from vedic sanskrit thru prakrit till classical sanskrit  
  
I do not wish to make any judgements / conclusions here, only bringing the above points to the group's notice as they may be relevant to the topic at hand. If they seem too vague, please ignore them.  
  
Pranaams,  
Jaideep
