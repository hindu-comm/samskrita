@hnbhat-ji: Thanks for a detailed information on this and the quotes from Mahabhashya.  
  
I find it hard to believe some of the observations of Pollock.  
  
If other than upper-strata were never let to learn Sanskrita, what about Valmiki ? He is considered the foremost poet! What about Vyasa - he was not a Brahmana by birth but \*the\* most important person in Indian history.  
  
Anyway Im digressing from my main question.. but thanks for all the different pieces of information from literature. Is there information on when Prakrita ceased to be a spoken language?
