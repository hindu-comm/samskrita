Dear Group,  
  
Shyam observed above that according to the legend surrounding  

KAlidAsa's life, his wife was a princess who was very educated, so he  

might very well have spoken to her in saMskRtra.  
  
To this I would reply that we know several couples in today's India  
where both the husband and the wife are persons of high achievements  
and make significant contribution to the society in their public lives  
by using English as their vehicle of thought. Yet, these persons,  
leaving out those few who are totally anglicised, speak their mother  
tongues in their houses with each other.  
  
I believe that the kind of linguistic apartheid that we see in  
Sanskrit plays where Dushyanta speaks in Sanskrit to Shakuntala and  
she understands it perfectly and yet replies back in Prakrit. Can we  
seriously think that that was how people really carried out that most  
common of human activities - speech?  
  
As to evidence, I doubt if indisputable evidence has been left  
anywhere. But where does the 'balance of convenience' lie? If  
evidence has to be produced the onus for so doing is on those who want  
to argue against the balance of convenience.
