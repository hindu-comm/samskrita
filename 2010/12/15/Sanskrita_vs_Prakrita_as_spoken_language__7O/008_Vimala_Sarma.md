Dear Bhat-ji

I am not very knowledgeable about traditional interpretations, but I wonder if one can make the inference that having knowledge of Vedas necessarily means Brahmin. This word refers to a social group in modern India but it does not apply in mythology. Ravana grandfather was supposed to be born from BrahmA’s ear – ie the mythological god, but this does not mean he is a Brahmin in the modern sense of the word. The great rishis of yore such as the famous Agastya, Kanva, Visvamitra, etc, were mainly warriors but became brahmavidAH (acquired knowledge of Brahman – the abstract concept) through tapas, but this again does not mean they were brahmin in the modern sense of the word.

Please correct me.
