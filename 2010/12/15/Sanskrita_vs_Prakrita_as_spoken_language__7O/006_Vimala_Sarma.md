Dear Vasus Mahodaya

There is the Kamasutra by Vatsyayana which is obviously written for a wealthy, cultured and leisured class of people, who did not have to do any manual work. They are instructed to know both Sanskrit and other vernaculars, and should be able to compose poetry, etc. This text dates about 2 CE.
