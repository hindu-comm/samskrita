Arvind-ji  
  
Thanks for the views, but I was looking for evidences.  

  
"I am sure Kalidas would not be speaking with his wife in Sanskrit! He would use his local Prakrit for it."  
  

Here is hoping that "South Asian scholars" do not take this seriously and write Ph.D thesis titled "On important findings of why Kalidasa did not speak Sanskrit".  
  
Here is my drive - If a few hundred years from now people watched Indian movieswithout any other frame of reference , they would assume that lovers danced around trees and sang songs alternatively. Surely that wasn't the case in reality. Similarly making different people speak different languages could be a technique rather than a reality. That is why I was asking if there are some other evidences. I remember Mahabhashya mentions about it, I am not sure.  
  
Thanks!  
Vasu
