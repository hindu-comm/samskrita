Dear Group,  
  
Regarding Sanskrit as a spoken language at any time in India's past, I  
would put across this possible view.  
  
It is obvious that the precursor language of the classical Sanskrit  
that developed after Panini, was a spoken language used by the  
speakers for all their activities, from the day-to-day mundane  
intercourse to higher levels like poetry (Vedas), performance of  
rituals etc. Its perfected successor, Sanskrit of Panini, on the  
other hand, could not have been very suitable for casual interactions  
as it was tightly bound by rules of grammar. It became the vehicle of  
learned thought and was used as such by persons whose normal languages  
for casual communication were their own varieties of Prakrit.  
Sanskrit would thus be used primarily as a literary language and  
secondarily as the common language for interaction between speakers of  
different Prakrit languages.  
  
A good example to explain this would be Latin in Europe the Middle  
Ages. Scholars with different mother tongues used Latin for their  
scholarly pursuits and for interaction with each other. But it was  
just that - it was not a 'spoken language' in the Middle Ages.  
Perhaps another good example would be English in today's India.  
(Leave aside the fact that it is actually the spoken language in  
England, America, Canada etc. Think of its place in India.) Most  
educated Indians do their writing - professional and scholarly - in  
English and also use it for communicating with persons with whom they  
do not share a common Indian language. Yet these persons use the  
local languages in their houses, in bazars and for all casual  
communication.  
  
I think the same would have been the case with learned Brahmins,  
princes and such other persons as are shown speaking Sanskrit in  
classical plays. I am sure Kalidas would not be speaking with his  
wife in Sanskrit! He would use his local Prakrit for it.
