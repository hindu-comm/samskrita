Hi All,

  

One most note that Buddhists and Jains always consider Prakrit as the source language.

  

One Jain author notes,

  

*\[...\]bāla mahilādi subodhaṁ sakala bhāṣāni bandhanabhūtaṁ vacanam ucyate \| meghanirmuktajalam ivaikasvarūpaṁ tad eva ca deśaviśeṣāt saṁskārakaraṇāc ca samāsāditaviśeṣaṁ sat saṁskṛtādyuttaravibhedān āpnoti \|\[...\]*

*  
*

**\[...\] \[Prakrit\] is said to be a language easy to understand for children and women, the origin of all languages. Like the water released by a cloud, it has but one form, yet, once differences have entered because of the difference between regions and because of beautification, it acquires the later distinctions between Sanskrit and the other languages. \[...\]**

The same author, gives an alternative etymology for prAkRta as prAk + KrRta = Done Before.
