Respected Members,

  

Though my generation was brought up with the concept that Sanskrit is the "mother language"- or the start of all languages in India, I strongly agree with the school of thought put forth by Arvindji.

  

More over, I would like to add that this new language - which was aptly termed "Sanskrit" which I think means something like refined / perfected / defined by strict rules , was indeed used to provide a single language for exchange of knowledge and thought across a big country like India.

How else would some person born in Kerala - Adi Shankarachrya be able to move across the country and start his schools in four corners of India and set a precedent to have the respective heads/ deans of schools to come from across the country ?

All the elite of that era must have indeed communicated in this common language for matters related to learning, codification of knowledge - in form of various books / vedas , for trade across the country and for administration, poltics.

  

Would like to read more on this thread of thought from the more learned members.
