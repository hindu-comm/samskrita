Dear Arvind,

Does not the existence of villages/homes in current India where saMskRta  
(the "saMskRta of PANini") is the spoken language prove  
that it can be suitable for casual interactions ? I do not understand  
why PANini's work makes it unsuitable for normal communication.

Of course, if you believe the legend surrounding KAlidAsa's life, his  
wife was a princess who was very educated, so he might very  
well have spoken to her in saMskRtra :-)

Regards,  
Shyam
