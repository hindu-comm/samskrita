As many of you know by now, a Grand Samskrit Book Fair is being organized in Bangalore during Jan 7-10, 2011.  
<http://samskritbookfair.org/>  
The public attendance is free for all the activities and book fair. Major preparations are under way in Bangalore to make it a grand success and give a boost to public interest in Samskrit.  

-   **Exhibits** to showcase the knowledge heritage of India. -   **Book Sale Event**: Over 300 new Samskrit Books released, 100
    Samskrit-related publishers participating. -   **Cultural Programs**: Concerts, dramas, puppet shows, model homes,
    marketplaces – all in Simple Samskrit. -   **All India Samskrit Conference**: Vaak spardhaa, Seminars,
    Sammelans of various focus groups.

The Samskrit book fair is a labor of love by a team of Samskrit-loving organizations dedicated to revitalizing the language. **This is much more than a book sale event.** It is an effort to revive public interest in Samskrit and to promote it as a language of modern scientific and social discourse.

**In Urgent Need of Funds**:  

Though there is substantial government support, due to the sheer scale of this event and the paucity of commercial interest in Samskrit today, **there is need for a lot more funds than we could procure so far to meet the logistical expenses**. These funds are needed to support scholars and students visiting the fair at highly subsidized rates, and to organize the Samskrit conference and exhibition.

There are about 10000 confirmed delegates - scholars, students, karyakartas - coming from 25 states of India.  
Delegates (<http://www.samskritbookfair.org/?page_id=492>) are being provided lodging and boarding at minimal cost (200Rs and Student 100Rs for four days.)  
  
The total cost estimate for the event is over 3 Crores and revenue is too short (less than half the estimate) after counting all the commitments and fees being charged.  
  
**How You can Help:**  
So this is an appeal of donation to all concerned.  
More information is available at
<http://www.samskritbookfair.org/?page_id=217>  
  
The direct appeal is  
• Sponsor a Delegate: Rs. 1000/- will help meet the food, accommodation of a visiting scholar as well as support part of the conference and exhibition expenses.  
• Sponsor 10 Delegates: Rs. 10000/- or USD 250/- will support ten such delegates to the event.  
Please note that these schemes are suggestive only. Your donation will be used to cover the overall event expenses.  
Please come up with new schemes to get your community to support this great event.  
1000Rs x 10000 donors = 1 crore Rs.  
10000Rs x 1000 donors = 1 crore Rs.  
You know the math. A small amount each by a lot of people adds up to a lot.  
  
**How to Donate:**  
The details of bank transfer are in the volunteering page <http://www.samskritbookfair.org/?page_id=217>  
Currently, due to Govt regulation issues, we cannot accepts fund transfers directly from banks outside India. So please make transfers only from a Bank account in India, if you have one.  
  
Can you help us by making a one-time donation of Rs. 10000/- or USD 250 equivalent?  
And here is an opportunity to show your love for the Samskrit language in action and catapult the Samskrit movement to the next level. Please do it fast, as the event is round the corner.  
  
Thanks.
