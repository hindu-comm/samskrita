The sloka that I learnt as a child goes like this.

duhswapna duhshakuna durgati daurmanasya  
durbhiksha durvyasana dussaha durvisaamsii  
utpaata-taapa vishhabheeti masadgrahaadyam  
vyaadheemshcha naashe tu me  
jagadaamadeeshah.

Many parts of this seem corrupt to me. If someone can just correct  
this, and render a translation, that would be great..  
thanks
