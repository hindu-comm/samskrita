hi Namaskara,



Sometime back, there was circulation of Sri Ranga Stotram and Sri Lakshmi Astakam in this forum. Can someone let me know who composed Sri Ranga Stotram and also its meaning.



I really enjoy reading this sloka, a very beautiful composition.



thanks for sharing



warm regards

Kuppuswamy
