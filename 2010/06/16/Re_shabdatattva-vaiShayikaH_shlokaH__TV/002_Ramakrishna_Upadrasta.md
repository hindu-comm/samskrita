praNAmaH members,

The shloka is a well known one, and is the first shloka of  
bhatRihari's vAkyapadIya. The shloka has deep implications in the  
world view of grammarians (which is much closer to mImAMsaka-s and  
different from how vedantins see it).

A very nice translation of it is by Shri Ananda-Wood. One can read it from here
