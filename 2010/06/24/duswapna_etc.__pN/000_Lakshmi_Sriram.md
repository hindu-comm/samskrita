Sri Mohan  
Thanks a lot. What would be the sources of such slokas - generally  
speaking? About the other well known sloka you mentioned, what does  
ramaskadham mean? If it is accusative of Rama and skandha then it  
should be in dwivacana. Some people say vaikadeyam instead of  
vainateyam; is there a word like that? And what is vrakodara doing in  
this group? What would Bheema be doing in the company of Devatas like  
Rama, Skandha, Hanuman and Garuda?  
regards  
lakshmi
