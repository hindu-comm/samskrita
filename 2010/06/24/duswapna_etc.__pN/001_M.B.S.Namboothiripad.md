Dear Lakshmi,

I feel the meanings are as follows:  
ramaskandha means ramaH yasya skandhe (asti) saH - one who has raama on  
his shoulder.  
(A person carrying raama on his shoulder)  
vRkodara - vRkasya udaram iva udaram yasay saH - Onw who has his waist  
like that of a Vrka  
(a healthy person who does not have fat accumulated on the waist)  
- or is it that one who is a glutton like a tiger?  
- When we use kRshodari in case a woman, we mean slim waisted - not a  
woman wo has her belly  
thinned down due to utter poverty .  
I think the word vRkodara got stuck with Bhima and people are not allowed  
to use it with anybody....

vainateya means son of vinata. I do not know any rule which says na and  
ka rae intechangable.

Regards,  
Namboothiripad.
