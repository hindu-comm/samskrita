Dear Sri Nambootharipad  
Thanks for that. The question of the meaning of the entire sloka  
remains. If ramaskandha and hanumanta refer to the same God, then  
maybe vRkodara and Vainateya refer to the same Garuda. There would be  
some logic in the construction of the sloka too. One remembers  
Hanuman and Garuda before going to bed (making it an immensely  
Vaishnavite sloka :) ), and each is referred to by two names each.  
would that be plausible? if not, who in this context could be  
vRkodara? by the way, is ramaskandha one of the well known or  
accepted names for Hanuman? Maybe to be found in some nAmAvali?  
regards  
lakshmi
