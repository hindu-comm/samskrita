praNamAmi!

  

I have a book 'Rudra Mantras' by R. L. Kashyap, Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastri Institute of Vedic Culture / SAKSI publication. I think it qualifies for "pada-artha-sahitAH sasvara-vedamantrAH".

  

It has word for word meaning for the namakam, chamakam, ... I know they have other similar books, and you may find what you are looking for.
