namassarvebhyaH!

  

I was browsing through a Samskrita Bharati booklet 'An Introduction to Mrigapakshishastra of Hansadev'. I came across a Panini snippet that I wanted to share with you all. Here is the gist of the extract.

...

Panini has given the etymology of Panchasya as (pa\~Jcham-vistRtam Asyam-mukham yasya saH pa\~JchAsyaH) - the one whose jaws are always wide open. he could 'etymologize' Panchasya (probably a reference to thewhite lions- likely extinct now), but he was not able to trace theorigin of the word'vyAghraH'.  So, he went into the forest to trace the animal. As soon as he located a tiger, Panini started observing the beast keenly and minutely. The animal must have been hungry. So he started moving towards Panini. Noting this movement of the Tiger, the reasoning behind the name dawned on Panini. He instructed his disciples to note down the origin of the word vyAghraH as - vyAjighrati iti vyAghraH. So saying, he became an illumined victim of the beast that is said to kill even if not hungry.

...

  

Thus the story that starts with the mAheshvara-sUtrANi ends in the mouth of a vyAghraH \| I am sure you understand my temptation to share the story here.
