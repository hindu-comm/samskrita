Dear Hans,

really I think you must rely on the suggestion Vimala gave you. MacDonell is one of the best reference grammars for Sanskrit language. I don't deny that Panini is one of the most important linguists ever born on earth, but it is almost impossible to use his wonderful grammar for us, the same as we can't use Varro's grammar to learn Latin.

As for forming the present stem of 1st class verb, it is not enough to form the stem (+a) and add the endings, you have to give a guna degree to the root (instead, you maintain the base, that is zero degree, for the 6th class; tud \> tudati).

So, root krS \> karSati; klp \> kalpate; vij \> vejate; guS . goSati..There are some exceptions to this rule depending of so-called heavy roots, etc. As for gacchati, we have an amplification of the root with an old inchoative affix (you can find also in icchati, yacchati, rcchati and few others) So for this reason the root is modified before adding the stem affix a.

Some roots are originally duplicated (like the 3d class verbs, but with a different vowel in the duplicating syllable): sthâ \> ti-SThati; sad \> sîdati (from si-sdati); pâ \> pi-bati (with sonorization of the root
p>b). In these cases they have the zero degree of the root, thoughthey belong to 1st class, because of the original Vedic stress (there is general agreement between stress and degree, but with some exceptions).

Anyway, get McDonell!

Namaste, Piergiorgio Muzi
