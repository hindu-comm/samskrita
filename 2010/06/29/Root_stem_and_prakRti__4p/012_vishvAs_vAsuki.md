Just so that you know: shankarAchArya is a household name that needs no introduction, not just among the members of this email list, but also among hindus in general. Whether or not he was a neumerologist, given his cultural context, I would guess that he was quite acquainted with jyotiShya (astrology, not that we need believe in it).
