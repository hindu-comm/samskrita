Hi all,



I am trying to understand the relation between the grammar concepts of root, stem and pada. First, here is the explanation from Thomas Egenes book:



gam: root (dhAtu)

gaccha: verbal stem (aGga), formed according to verb class

gacchati: tinanta pada formed by adding conjugation inflection (tin)



Similarly, for nouns:

Root (dhAtu)

Nominal Stem, prAtipadika, formed by adding pratyaya, specifically a kRt primary derivative ending to the root (or another nominal stem)

Subanta pada formed by adding declension inflection (sup) to the stem



Correct so far? But what is then prakRti? In some books I have looked, it is equivalent to root, in others to stem. In Rama Nath Sharmas Intorduction to AD as a Grammatical Device, it is used (p. 165) as a general name for “dhAtu (verb root) and prAtipadika (nominal stem)”



Can someone please enlighten me and provide a structure for these concepts?
