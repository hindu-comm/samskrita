Hans – I think a good grammar like one by Arthur MacDonell should help you.



The root first has to change into the present stem and then the verbal endings are added.

Changing root into stem has number of rules, including internal sandhi depending on the class of the root.

There are ten classes, which fall into two broad groups – thematic 1, 4 6 and 10 classes, and athematics – the rest.

For athematics there is the further complication of having strong and weak forms of the root - strong forms are used for singular endings except for optatives and for imperative where strong form is for *1*st person in all numbers and 3^(rd) singular, and for class 3 there is a reduplication of root again according to rules.

For present, imperfect past , optatives and imperative the present stem is used and the correct endings for number person is attached – again with rules.

Again there are two broad classes of endings – atmanepada and parasmaipada which have different standard endings, and roots can fall into either or both.



For other tenses – the endings are attached to the root or the modified root with rules.

It is not a good idea to start with root gam because this is irregular.



In the case of bhU – this is class 1 and this is usually parasmaipada.

bhU + a+ ti which is 3^(rd) person singular ending in present indicative tense.

Internal sandhi makes the stem bhava; hence bhavati.

While waiting for a clarifying reply, I have to add the following remark:



In many places, it is said that

 tinanti pada = root (dhatu) + inflextion (tin).

But should it not be:

 tinanta pada = stem (aGga) + inflextion (tin) ?



e.g. bhavati = bhava + ti (and not bhu+ti)



Or does the term dhatu of Panini cover both what we call root and stem?
Is aGga a term defined later, to distinguish between root and stem?



Hans
