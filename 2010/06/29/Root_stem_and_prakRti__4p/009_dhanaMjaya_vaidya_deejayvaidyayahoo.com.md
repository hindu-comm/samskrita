Looks mostly right. I would not use the metaphor of subtraction  
though.  
  
I suppose "prakRti" (a word not mentioned by pANini) could be dhAtu  
(verb-roots, which are lexemes listed in the dhAtupATha, or a few  
others formed through grammatical transformations "sanAdyantA  
dhAtavaH") or prAtipadika (which are mostly obtained by grammatical  
transformation=clear etymology). However, note that these derived  
roots contain a pratyaya too!  
nadI (river)  
comes from nada + I (feminine pratyaya) -> nadI  
here is nada is aGga with respect to the I pratyaya  
  
however to form the nominative dual case nadI, you have  
nadI + au -> nadyau  
  
Here nadI is the aGga with respect to the au pratyaya.  
  
Thus "aGga" is not subtractive but contextual.  
  
As also explained in the example by Naresh, in  
bhU+a+ti  
bhU is tha aGga in the context of -a-  
but bhU-a is the aGga in the context of the ti
