I am afraid you are missing my point. It is not about whether Panini's is the best or most concise or whatever other superlative one may want to use. All I saying is that before saying that problem X or Y is not addressed by these grammarians (i.e., before or after Panini), one must \*know\* what is addressed! Let me add that I do not claim, by any stretch, to possess that kind of knowledge.

One is certainly free to pursue whichever path is considered the best from one's own perspective. At the same time, we should be cognizant of the limitations of the approach. I gave some examples of this in previous mails.

I still maintain that \*if\* one wants to learn and appreciate the thinking behind the sutras, one has no choice but to work with them directly and with real-world examples that are quoted. The grammarians did not see their work in isolation with the rest of the society. Rather, usages, examples, philosophical musings, humor (however lame) all find place here.

This just seems like another example of ascribing property X or Y without knowing what is conveyed in the sutras. Consider the way Panini organized letters with his mAheshvara sutras. I am sure you know about the significance as far as speech production is concerned.  
  
More generally, he uses an utsarga-apavAda method. As far as possible, capture observed usages through a common rule. This is utsarga. But this is not possible always because of just the nature of speech. For those exceptions, make up special rules.  
  
Another case in point: One sees several variables like ghi, gati, etc. which are used in general rules. And those that don't follow the general pattern get special treatment.  
  
One cannot dismiss the entire approach by saying rote-learning = bad. Reality is a lot more nuanced.

Learning that something is called A or B in English does not prepare you to learn from the sutras! Just as knowing how to play cricket does not prepare you to play football (aka soccer). Sure, both are forms of sport involving 11 players on each side! But cricket is cricket and football is football.  
  
  
Look, all I hear from this series of emails (and similar ones in the past) is a dogmatic refusal to attempt Samskritam on its terms (sutra or otherwise). And I say this as someone who started learning Samskritam grammar through the non-Samskritam route (through English and Indian regional languages using Kale's book and high school textbooks).
