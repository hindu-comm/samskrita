Hi, mahodaya Naresh,

thanks for your exhausting reply. Evenif I don't share completely all its content, I much appreciate your invitation to go deeper inside vernacular grammarand traditional Indian philosophy of language. Sorry,I didn't want at all to introduce Shankaracarya to you, but only express my serious interest in that topic. About hisknowing astrology,I wonder of course, but it's true that those times astrology was considered a "normal science" both in Europe and in Asia. It's no scandal. It is possible that present state of art in modern science in incapable todeal with it, except for some occasional interests(e.g. C.G.Jung). I'm not an expert in this field.

About all the matter of the apophony in I.E. languages, as well as the issue of Universal Grammar in Chomskian sense,unluckily we don't have a common field of learning (I am graduated in modern general linguistics on"Critical considerations about the fundaments of generative grammar". This meansthat Ihave to get a deeper acquaintance with the reference and books you have said. Thanks for it very much.

I have been in Singapore for seven years and there Ifoughtin defence of Sanskrit against a negative attitude of WesternizedIndians and parochial Europeans, so I'm ready to accept very favourably your kind observations and take advantage from them.

BTW, sorry for mistaking the addressee of my previous email (but anyway, Iadmirevery much Abhyankar's "learn Sanskrit byFresh Approach"andI have suggested it to allmy friends who are studying Sanskrit in Singapore).

Thanks for all, namaste,

Piergiorgio Muzi
