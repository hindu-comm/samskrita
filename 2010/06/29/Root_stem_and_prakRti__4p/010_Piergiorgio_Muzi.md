Sorry, mahodaya Abhyankar, I haven't said that it is "impossible" to learn  
Sanskrit by means of  
Panini's grammar. I said it is "almost impossible", that is, very difficult;  
besides, it can create more barriers to students than the direct approach to  
the language being lead by general and serious knowledge of cross-linguistic  
grammar. What's its use in teaching/learning Sanskrit? I'm reading these  
conversation about the meaning of this or that rule or Sanskrit technical  
term. This seems to mean that, to understand we have to translate them into  
the same language (at present preferably English...unluckily for me!) we use  
for every language grammatical terms, like subject, object, clause,  
predicate, prefix, suffix, transitive, passive, genitive, instrumental....  
Only this way we can recognize in Sanskrit the same universal structure all  
the languages have got, from the primitive to the developed ones, like  
Sanskrit itself.  
I allow myself to notice:  
1. The XIX century's grammarians, who gave all there life to study Sanskrit  
inhered non only important notions from Indian vaiyâkarana-s, but also  
learned the analytical and logical methods to found and carry out  
linguistic research.  
The modern linguistics, both comparative and synchronic, is due to their  
effort, which started with Panini, etc. and only continued with Max Mûller,  
etc.  
and arrives to De Saussure, N.Chomsky and all the modern linguistics great  
scholars.  
This is the reason why you who are a serious scholar of Sanskrit possess the  
dictionary of Monier-Williams or MacDonell and need them.  
If Panini had to be born again and have a chair in an Eastern or Western  
University, he wouldn't repeat what he said in IV century b.C., but he would  
prove the same scientific accuracy and rigor in his modern theories and  
discoveries. But we don't need revelation and dogmatism.  
2. You know that a lot of things about Greek and Latin grammar have been  
cleared and deepened thanks to the study of Sanskrit, in spite of the stupid  
refusal by some Eurocentric people, like James Mill, etc. Luckily important  
linguistic analysis have been embodied in general grammatical theories, e.g.  
the  
compound, the attention to correct phonological systems and mechanisms,  
the generative structure of morphology, etc.  
The present general grammar of every school is a fruit both of the Indian  
origin and of the encounter with  
a developing Western culture, people who loved and love the greatness of  
Indian culture and its deep involvement in researching of universal truth.  
3. It is for this reason that you can't find a sufficient explanation of  
syntax in Panini, but the most important and precious book about syntactical  
rules is that of Speijer, where you can find the spirit of Panini and  
several quotations from Astadhyaya, together with crosslinguistic account  
comparing Latin and Old-Greek with Sanskrit. The same you could see on  
Apte's composition book and in many other works.  
4. I can give an example of incompleteness of Panini's grammar, due to the  
fact that Panini couldn't get the tools to enrich his theory up to a  
universal level. I could give tens  
of other examples, but consider only: gata/gantum, hata/hantum, mata/mantum,  
bhavatas/bhavantas, etc. Why this alternation between a and an? Only by  
comparison, which shows general laws of apophony, together with discovery of  
the development of vocalic nasals in I.E languages, could you get a clear  
reason of these facts and their rule. (See Szemerényi, Introduction to  
Indo-European linguistics).  
5. Of course I envy your knowledge of Panini's grammar, since it is  
important  
about the history of Indian linguistic science and mainly about spiritual  
attitude of reasoning and researching true laws of the human language, which  
now a lot of thinkers do believe to be one of the most important path to  
catch essentials features of the cognitive processes and also, just like  
Bhartrhari  
saw, the ontology of human mind and its place in nature, as well as its  
transcendence and freedom.  
6. I'm planning to come to India (it would be the eleventh time!) to  
concentrate on the study of Panini and, above all, to be assisted in my  
reading and translating Upadeçasâhasrî of Çankaracârya (a great philosopher  
and theologian, not a numerologist...).
