Are we discussing the subject of which way of learning Samskrit grammar  
is "easier", or are we discussing which way of exposition of grammar is  
more logical/rational? I assume the former.  
In that case, "easy" is obviously inherently subjective, and hence  
relative to the way of thinking/learning that people of certain epoch  
are accustomed to.  
The learning methodology that people of Panini's/Varadarajaachaarya's  
times must have been accustomed to and their intellectual capacity might  
be very different from those of people of modern times. So it's natural  
for many moderns to find the traditional style of exposition difficult  
to follow. That's ok, and grammatical expositions (called bhaaShyas or  
commentaries) suited to such minds are bound to sprout from time to time.

Having said that, one cannot judge the relative technical merit of those  
exposition styles from only one breed of learners' view point.  
The ability to keep lots of rules in one's memory and apply them in a  
moment's notice to any complex reasoning (called 'avadhaana' or  
'dhaaraNa') is a skill that comes naturally to traditionally taught  
Indian pupils at a very tender age. Memorization is not as big a deal  
for them as for many modern students because systematic development of  
intellectual capacity is a mainstream practice for them unlike modern  
education where it's a mere side-effect. And a treatise written assuming  
such a sharp memory and intellectual acumen would obviously be difficult  
for those not trained that way. That is not a problem with the treatise,  
but with the readers, and that's why newer treatises will and should  
arise periodically to cater to the changing times.

Even now, I know scholars in India who find the Ashtadhyaayi approach of  
Samskrit grammar exposition to be much more systematic and intuitive  
than even Siddhanta kaumudi, not even to speak of modern grammar books.  
They find modern grammar theories to be a haphazard amalgam compared to  
the muni-trayam's approach to grammar. And they have their reasons to  
substantiate that.

If we're arguing about which method is easier, I feel that'll be a rat  
hole because of its inherent subjectivity.
