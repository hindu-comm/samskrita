namaste,

These replies seem to elude the fact that Siddanta Kaumudi and Laghu  
Siddanta Kaumidi were exactly steps in this direction: make pANini  
more accessible by reorganizing the rules and give a condensed set of  
rules respectively. In this context, it is not clear why the books of  
Indologists should be given more precedence to the work of Indian  
grammarians?

\> I understand where you are coming from but I would like to givefurther support to Piergiorgio's position. No one is suggesting that Pannini is incomplete - it is the very best and concise grammar ever written. But is was written at a certain period for a particular purpose. It is one way of learning Sanskrit but it is hard way and takes many years to master the rules as written in sutras.  
\>  
\> In this age there are other equally good or better ways of learning which are easier. The Indologists have written extremely good grammars, and linguists and philologists have compared the classical languages - Greek, Latin German with Sanskrit so they are coming from a much broader perspective because they can see common patterns in morphology and phonology and in grammar.  
\>  
\> The method of learning is not by rote or remembering but by understanding certain principles and being able to recognise forms through knowing where to look things up.  
\>  
\> This method gives a good understanding and is a equally valid way of learning. It is not a matter a reading Pannini first. If one does this without having some knowledge it will not be possible to understand it let alone learn from it.  
\>  
\> Vimala
