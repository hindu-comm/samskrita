Dear Piorgiorgio,

  

I already have McDonenell and Whitney and numerous introductions (like Egenes and Goldman which are both very good) from which I try to learn Sanskrit. However, since my interest in Sanskrit is primarily from linguistic reasons, I also want understand Panini and his grammatical system as such.

  

That is the reason for my original questions about dhAtu, aGga and prakRti. Thanks to the replies so far, things are getting much more clear now.

  
Hans
