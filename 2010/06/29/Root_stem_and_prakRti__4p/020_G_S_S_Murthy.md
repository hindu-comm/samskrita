Dear Sirs,  

Regarding Panini and methods of learning Sanskrit, it need not be stressed that all languages except computer languages have naturally evolved and grammars attempt to provide an artificial structure through classification and discovery of artificial rules to explain the variegated ways in which natural languages are expressed and used. In the realm of providing such a structure to a naturally evolved language Panini is unsurpassed. In fact most modern languages are not provided with a structure like the one devised by Panini for Sanskrit.

However, learning Sanskrit through Panini may not be the best method for a modern learner unless he is willing to go through the traditional route. The system prevalent in the olden days was that the student knew by rote declensions of nouns and conjugation of verbs along with Amarakosha before he matured to study Panini. He would have also studied a few cantos of Kalidasa, Bharavi and Magha. This stream of Sanskrit learning has flowed continuously for more than two millennia in India. The best and the most brilliant became proficient in Sanskrit through this method.

Even the prevalent methods of teaching Sanskrit as a second or third language in Indian schools and colleges fail to make a student conversant.

There is a concerted effort to teach conversational Sanskrit by Sanskritabharati. Unless one is soaked in the ambience of a language in ones day to day activities, one may not learn a language much except through serious study.

It is in this context that I have devised a series of 30 lessons through which a learner is exposed to the broad outlines of Sanskrit grammar and a fairly broad base of vocabulary. These lessons are given free over Email and I am happy that quite a few are learning through this course. Details can be seen at
