\> I think भव is still an अङ्ग with respect to ति

On second thoughts, this is probably not correct because there is no  
scope for further pratyaya operations. The final form bhavati is set.

However, in the case of भवामि, भवावः, भवामः, भव would be an अङ्ग with  
respect to मिप् वस् मस् respectively because these pratyayaas bring  
the following rule into play: अतो दीर्घो यञि
