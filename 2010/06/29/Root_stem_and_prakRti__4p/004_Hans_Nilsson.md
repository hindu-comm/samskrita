Dear Naresh,

Thank you for the very enlightening reply. I have now found and read 1.4.13 and it's commentaries. So my understanding is now that:  
aGga: the base which is left after stripping off a pratyaya suffix (be it tin, sup or other) from a final pada or intermediate construct.

How does this then differ from prakRti?

My understanding is here (pls correct if wrong) that this is the ORIGINAL base to which pratyaya is applied. It may in some cases be the same as the resulting aGga but may also be different, if for example the aGga is a gunated form of a root, or an upasarga has been added to the root.

To use a somewhat halting mathematical metaphor:  
prakRti is the operand of an addition, but aGga is the result of a subtraction...

Hans
