Hans,

I am writing mainly to motivate more knowledgeable list members to reply.  
My (admittedly, shaky) understanding is as follows:

अङ्ग is defined in 1.4.13 as:  
यस्मात् प्रत्ययविधिः तदादि प्रत्यये अङ्गम् ।

For something to qualify as अङ्ग it is not sufficient to be a simply a  
base like a प्रातिपदिक or धातु. We need a few things in addition: the  
presence of a pratyaya operation, and that form which begins. The  
latter means, for example, that upsarga + dhaatu together would form  
the अङ्ग when pratyaya is applied.

Sketching the textbook example bhU,  
Using,  
तिङ् शित् सार्वधातुकम्  
and  
कर्तरि शप् ( ... सार्वधातुके परे)

we form भू + अ + ति \[शप् = अ in essence\]  
The अ is also termed the vikaraNa pratyaya

From previous definitions, भू qualifies as an अङ्ग with respect to अ  
+ ति and gets a गुण (because सार्वधातुक follows.)  
गुण of उ is ओ,  
so भो + अ + ति = भव + ति (एचोऽयवायावः explains the अवादेश)  
I think भव is still an अङ्ग with respect to ति  
Then, no more scope for sandhi and we get the final form.

  
The point is that अङ्ग is defined with respect to a pratyaya, whereas  
dhaatu stands by itself.

Btw, अङ्ग applies both dhaatus and praatipadikas.

  
Regarding writing  
तिङन्त = धातु + तिङ्  
may be ok as a first-order approximation.
