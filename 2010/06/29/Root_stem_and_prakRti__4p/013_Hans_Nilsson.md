Dear all,

Thanks to your replies, I now understand that prakRti and aGna are more or less equivalent. aGna is defined by Panini as the input operand to a pratyaya.  
prakRti is not used by Panini but according to Louis Renou, it is defined in Sarasvatikanthabharana by Bhojedava as  
tad ubhayaM vikaraNavIbhakti ca pratyaye prakRtiH.

The difference between the two terms is that aGna is only defined in relation to a pratyaya, whereas prakRti can "stand by itself".

Looks mostly right. I would not use the metaphor of subtraction  
though.

I suppose "prakRti" (a word not mentioned by pANini) could be dhAtu  
(verb-roots, which are lexemes listed in the dhAtupATha, or a few  
others formed through grammatical transformations "sanAdyantA  
dhAtavaH") or prAtipadika (which are mostly obtained by grammatical  
transformation=clear etymology). However, note that these derived  
roots contain a pratyaya too!  
nadI (river)  
comes from nada + I (feminine pratyaya) -> nadI  
here is nada is aGga with respect to the I pratyaya

however to form the nominative dual case nadI, you have  
nadI + au -> nadyau

Here nadI is the aGga with respect to the au pratyaya.

Thus "aGga" is not subtractive but contextual.

As also explained in the example by Naresh, in  
bhU+a+ti  
bhU is tha aGga in the context of -a-  
but bhU-a is the aGga in the context of the ti
