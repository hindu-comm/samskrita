Just to clarify, it was my reaction, not Abhyankar ji's. Difficult, or not, the point was that students continue to learn "even today".

That assumes that there is a universal grammar to begin with! I refer you to this article:  
  
Evans N, Levinson SC, "The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science", Behav. Brain Science, Oct. 2009.  
  
This work along with others have dealt a severe blow to the theory of universals.  
  
Moreover, in your example of subject, object, etc., the important notion of anabhihite is lost if you try to map kartA to subject, etc.  
In English, we may define the nominative as subject - this is certainly not the case in the Paninian sense. (I will add that Kaatyaayana gives an alternate formulation with his abhihite prathamaa, etc., which is unnecessary in Panini's view of things.)

The sad thing is that the drive to conform to English-based teaching has meant a loss of several pedagogical methods. For example, the practice of learning Amarakosha / dhAtupATha, which was fairly common a few decades ago, has diminished drastically.

Who said anything about dogmatism? Similarly, what makes you think there is any less rigor in Panini's or the later grammarians' arguments?  
  
In fact, raising questions is an important part of traditional learning, which requires critical thinking.

Clearly, no one is claiming that Panini gave a universal structure or even that he covered all usages in Samskritam! (see, vaartikas, Kaatyaayana).  
  
Panini uses the notion of saamarthya to capture syntax. Of course, Kaatyaayana thinks that Panini did not do complete justice to that topic. So he added his thoughts, as did many others.  
  
In fact, there is a variety of opinions when it comes to syntax in Samskritam! I am not saying this to take away the contributions of Speijer - rather, to claim that these topics are not addressed at length previously is a bit of stretch. Of course, one should read several books - that is good. But one should not assume that these are a substitute for the main texts.

But the distinction between gam becoming gantum, whereas bhU becoming bhavitum is well-explained through iT, aniT, etc.  
Again, before asserting incompleteness, may I suggest that you study what is there in the first place!
