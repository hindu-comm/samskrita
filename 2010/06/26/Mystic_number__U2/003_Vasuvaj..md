Namaste.  
  
Kashchit suhrit mahyam etat patram preshitavaan .  
Kiiyataa pramaanena satyam asti iti na jaanaami. Dr.Subhash Kak asya lekhakah asti vaa iti api aham na jaanaami.  
  
\[Some time back I received such a mail informing that Mecca was once ruled by a king called Vikramaditya. This information was supposed to have been told by Dr.Subhash Kak.As it was told by Dr.Subhash Kak, this tidbit was published in 'Sambhashana Sandeshah'. Later on the real Dr.Subhash Kak informed us that he had never told such things. A lesson learnt the hard way- never trust all the things that are being forwarded through e-mail.  
  
The following passage is also ascribed to Dr.Subhash Kak.  
Yadi satyam asti, tarhi mahatah santoshasya vishayah bhavati. Anyathaa......!!!!\]  
  
  
  
  

Professor Subhash Kak of Louisiana State University recently called our attention to a remarkable statement by Sayana, a fourteenth century Indian scholar. In his commentary on a hymn in the Rig Veda, the oldest and perhaps most mystical text ever composed in India, Sayana has this to say:  
"With deep respect, I bow to the sun, who travels 2,202 yojanas in half a nimesha."  
  
A yojana is about nine American miles; a nimesha is 16/75 of a second. get out your calculators!  
  
2,202 yojanas x 9 miles x 75/8 nimeshas = 185,794 m. p. s.  
  
Basically, Sayana is saying that sunlight travels at 186,000 miles per second! How could a Vedic scholar who died in 1387 A. D. have known the correct figure for the speed of light? If this was just a wild guess it's the most amazing coincidence in the history of science! And Sayana was merely commenting on Rig Veda which was supposedly composed 9000 years ago !!  
  
The yoga tradition is full of such coincidences. Take for instance the mala many yoga students wear around their neck. Since these rosaries are used to keep track of the number of mantras a person is repeating, students often ask why they have 108 beads instead of 100. Part of the reason is that the mala represent the ecliptic, the path of the sun and moon across the sky. Yogis divide the ecliptic into 27 equal sections called nakshatras, and each of these into four equal sectors called paadas, or "steps," marking the 108 steps that the sun and moon take through heaven.  
  
Each is associated with a particular blessing force, with which you align yourself as you turn the beads.  
  
Traditionally, yoga students stop at the 109th "guru bead," also called MERU, flip the mala around in their hand, and continue reciting their mantra as they move backward through the beads. The guru bead represents the summer and winter solstices, when the sun appears to stop in its course and reverse directions. In the yoga tradition we learn that we're deeply interconnected with all of nature. Using a mala is a symbolic way of connecting ourselves with the cosmic cycles governing our universe.  
  
But Professor Kak points out yet another coincidence: The distance between the earth and the sun is approximately 108 times the sun's diameter. The diameter of the sun is about 108 times the earth's diameter. And the distance between the earth and the moon is 108 times the moon's diameter.  
  
Could this be the reason the ancient sages considered 108 such a sacred number? If the microcosm (us) mirrors the macrocosm (the solar system), then maybe you could say there are 108 steps between our ordinary human awareness and the divine light at the center of our being. Each time we chant another mantra as our mala beads slip through our fingers, we are taking another step toward our own inner sun.  
  
As we read through ancient Indian texts, we find so much the sages of antiquity could not possibly have known-but did. While our European and Middle Eastern ancestors claimed that the universe was created about 6,000 years ago, the yogis have always maintained that our present cosmos is billions of years old, and that it's just one of many such universes which have arisen and dissolved in the vastness of eternity.  
  
In fact the Puranas, encyclopedias of yogic lore thousands of years old, describe the birth of our solar system out of a "milk ocean," the Milky Way. Through the will of the Creator, they tell us, a vortex shaped like a lotus arose from the navel of eternity. It was called Hiranya Garbha, the shining womb \[womb here means the source, point of origin and not an anatomical reference \] and it gradually coalesced into our world, but will perish some day billions of years hence when the sun expands to many times it present size, swallowing all life on earth. In the end, the Puranas say, the ashes of the earth will be blown into space by the cosmic wind. Today we known this is a scientifically accurate, if poetic, description of the fate of our planet.  
  
The Surya Siddhanta is the oldest surviving astronomical text in the Indian tradition. Some Western scholars date it to perhaps the fifth or sixth centuries A. D., though the text itself claims to represent a tradition much, much older. It explains that the earth is shaped like a ball, and states that at the very opposite side of the planet from India is a great city where the sun is rising at the same time it sets in India. In this city, the Surya Siddhanta claims, lives a race of siddhas, or advanced spiritual adepts. If you trace the globe of the earth around to the exact opposite side of India, you'll find Mexico. Is it possible that the ancient Indians were well aware of the great sages/astronomers of Central America many centuries before Columbus discovered America?- the Mayans or Incas!!!  
  
Knowing the unknowable: To us today it seems impossible that the speed of light or the fate of our solar system could be determined without advanced astronomical instruments.  
  
How could the writers of ancient Sanskrit texts have known the unknowable? In searching for an explanation we first need to understand that these ancient scientists were not just intellectuals, they were practicing yogis. The very first lines of the Surya Siddhanta, informs about the Golden Age when a great astronomer named Maya desired to learn the secrets of the heavens, so he first performed rigorous yogic practices. Then the answers to his questions appeared in his mind in an intuitive flash.  
  
Does this sound unlikely? Yoga Sutra 3:26-28 states that through, samyama (concentration, meditation, and unbroken mental absorption) on the sun, moon, and pole star, we can gain knowledge of the planets and stars. Sutra 3:33 clarifies, saying: "Through keenly developed intuition, everything can be known." Highly developed intuition is called pratibha in yoga. It is accessible only to those who have completely stilled their mind, focusing their attention on one object with laser-like intensity. Those who have limited their mind are no longer limited to the fragments of knowledge supplied by the five senses. All knowledge becomes accessible to them.  
  
"There are those who would say that consciousness, acting on itself, can find universal knowledge, Professor Kak admits.  
"In fact this is the traditional Indian view."  
  
Perhaps the ancient sages didn't need advanced astronomical instruments. After all, they had yoga!.

प्रसीदयतु  
प्रणमामि  

may I add to this list, (though it still does not explain the mystery)



1\. saagar manthan had 54 asura + 54 suras = totalling 108  
2. the all the nakshtras areeach divided into 4 paada (quadrupeds)

 there are 27 nakshtras totalling 108 paadas in all.

3\. vishnu sahasranaama has 108 shlokas.

 (some say, one shloka for each of the nakshtra paada)



I think this is based on the number 9 (highestdigit in the decimal number system)



इति शम्  
कृष्ण
