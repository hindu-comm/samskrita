नमो नमः

About Number 18 -

\(1\) Total chapters in श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता

\(2\) Number of पर्वाः in महाभारतम्

\(3\) Total army which fought in the war 18 अक्षौहिणी

\(4\) Number of days the war lasted

\(5\) Number of मन्त्राः in ईशावास्योपनिषत् (excluding the शान्ति-मन्त्रः)

\(6\) 108, 1008, 10008 are all numbers divisible by 18. Such numbers along with श्री make a decoration such as श्री१०८, which is seen in the list of decorations of शङ्कराचार्याः I guess, more the number of zeros between 1 and 8, more learned and respectable a शङ्कराचार्यः is

\(7\) A जपमाला for count of one hundred has 108 beads.

\(8\) In योगक्रियाः Number of भस्रिकाः to be practised with each nostril closed  
(9) It seems the arithmetic significance starts with 9, than 18. In the multiples of number 9, digits in every multiple of number of 9, right up to 9x30 add up to 9, except (9x11). Yet even in 9x11 = 99 (9+9=18 --> 1+8 =9). Likewise in 9x21 = 189 (1+8+9 = 18 --> 1+8 = 9) Multiples of 1 in unit place will have this extended summation.

All this yet does not clarify "why is 18 mystic ?"

सस्नेहम् ,  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः \|  
श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।
