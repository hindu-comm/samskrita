We may add:  
1. It takes 9 months for human baby to form fully in mother's womb and the motherdelivers baby after9 months.  
2. It is after 9 nites of garba-raas navaratri that the rajoguNa personified RAvan is burnt(Dassera).  
3. In Chait navarAtri, it is on the 9th day that RAma is born (RAmanavamI)  
4. BhagvadgItA describes human body as a city with 9 doors.  
But yes. That still does not explain the mysticism attachedwithnumber 9 and its multiples.

may I add to this list, (though it still does not explain the mystery)

1\. saagar manthan had 54 asura + 54 suras = totalling 108  

\>2. the all the nakshtras areeach divided into 4 paada (quadrupeds)

there are 27 nakshtras totalling 108 paadas in all.

3\. vishnu sahasranaama has 108 shlokas.

(some say, one shloka for each of the nakshtra paada)

I think this is based on the number 9 (highestdigit in the decimal number system)
