Dear Mr Kaliprasad;  
  
Thank you most kindly for this wonderful gift. Everynight I go to bed, with pleasant anticipation of finding anotherprecious nugget of treasure of Samskrit knowledge waiting for me to savour, at this address from this generous group, as soon as I get up on the morrow!  
I am so content to find this one.  
  
Could anyone in the group transform this jewel into Devanaagari script and gift it to the rest of us? Thank you again.  
  
By the way, both my students and I, are getting addicted to Mr. Abhyankar's Subhashitams and the Samskrit lessons. Thanksfor that too.  
  
With warm regards,  
  
Dr. A. Iyengar
