Hi,  
  
This is my first post to the group!  
  
Firstly I would say that all these discussions are very great value adders to all not only Sanskrit aspirants like me, but also to those who want to know more about India's great culture. Mr. Abhyankar's lessons are wonderful: crisp and exhaustive.  
  
Does anyone know in which literature exactly this shloka of Pi appears?

Three rings to the elvenkings under the sky,  
Seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone,  
Nine for mortal men doomed to die,  
One for the dark lord on his dark throne.  
  
In the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie,  
One Ring to rule them all,  
One Ring to find them,  
One Ring to bring them all  
and in the Darkness bind them.  
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.
