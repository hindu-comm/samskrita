Hello All,  
 I am attempting to learn Sanskrit, and got hold of this book, First  
Lesson in Sanskrit - Dr. J.R. Ballantyne from  
<http://www.archive.org/details/FirstLessonInSanskrit>.  
  
 While the book is an excellent one, I don't have the solutions for  
the exercises mentioned in this book and as a result am not able to  
validate if my understanding is right.  
  
 Appreciate if any one can give me the solutions for the exercises  
  
Thanks  
Srikanth
