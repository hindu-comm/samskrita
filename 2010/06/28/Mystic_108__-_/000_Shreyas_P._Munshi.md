After reading respected Vasuvaj Sir’s highly informative email of 27Jun, I had sent the following email query to a retired professor of physics in US who is now deeply involved in researching into our ancient declarations and rituals:

**"In your studies, have you come across the equationthat one nimesha equals 16/75 of a second?Or is it that the equation is the result of
rationalization by resorting to backward calculation?"**  


For information of the scholarly Sanskrit fraternity, I am reproducing below some extracts from the professor’s reply. One need not believe all or any of it but perhaps it may prove to be some good material for the fraternity to discuss further. 

  
1. I must admit, I have not come across and I wont speculateexactly from whereone got the equation 1nimesh=16/75 of a second.. **But in Kautilya's Arthashastra,**1 nimesha is defined as 1/360000 of a day and night (86400 sec).This will give approximately same answer.  
2. **About mystic 108.** Some believe that this is because it is close to the ratio of distance of the sun from earth to the diameter of the sun and also the ratio of distance of the moon from the earth to the diameter of the moon. The modern ratio is about 107.8!!!

3. Recently, a Panditji (typically totally unaware of modern science)who was visiting US mentioned that 14 lakh earths can fit into sun. He probably read it in some scriptures.Modern value is about 13.7 lakh!

4. Our ancientswere also approximately right about the age of universe (at least 8.64 billion years). Modern value is 13.7 billion years. All the other religionsare talking about the age of universe as few thousand years. Christians still insist that according to Bible, this is the age!
