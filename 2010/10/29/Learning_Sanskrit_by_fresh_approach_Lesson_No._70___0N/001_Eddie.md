S. L. and All,



I have discovered something magical.

##### It is called SANSCRIPT (South **A**sian **N**etwork **S**oftware **C**onferring **R**elatively **I**mmediate **P**honetic **T**ransliteration)

Nine Indian and four Latin scripts can be transliterated in either directions - no typing, just a single press of a mouse button.



Here is what Lesson No. 70 looks like in one of those Latin scripts (IAST).

ITRANS is there too.





saṃskṛtādhyayanam ।

Learning Sanskrit by fresh approach – Lesson No. 70





saṃskṛtabhāṣāyāḥ nūtanādhyayanasya saptatitamaḥ (70) pāṭhaḥ ।

Just taking up a simpler subhāṣitam –



caturaḥ sakhi me bhartā yallikhati ko na vācayati ।

tasmādapyadhiko me yallikhati svayaṃ na vācayati \|\|

1 sandhi-vicchedān kṛtvā samāsānāṃ padāni ca darśayitvā \|



caturaḥ sakhi me bhartā yat likhati kaḥ na vācayati ।

tasmāt api adhika: me yat likhati svayaṃ na vācayati \|\|

2 samāsānāṃ vigrahāḥ śabdānāṃ vyutpattayaḥ viśleṣaṇāni ca \|





2.1 caturaḥ “catura” (= smart) iti viśeṣaṇam (adjective) । atra pulliṅgi (here, masculine) \| tasya prathamā vibhaktiḥ ekavacanam ca (first case, singular) \|



2.2 sakhi “sakhī” (= friend) iti strīliṅgi sāmānyanāma (feminine noun) \| tasya saṃbodhana-vibhaktiḥ ekavacanam ca (address or vocative case, singular) ।



2.3 me “asmad” (= I, we – pronoun of first person) iti sarvanāma \| tasya ṣaṣṭhī vibhaktiḥ ekavacanam ca (genitive case, singular) \|



2.4 bhartā “bhar” 1 pa (= to feed) iti dhātuḥ (verb) । tasmāt kartṛvācakaṃ viśeṣaṇam “bhartṛ” (= one, who feeds, hence, husband) ।
atra pulliṅgi (here masculine) \| tasya prathamā vibhaktiḥ ekavacanam ca (nominative i.e. first case, singular) \|
