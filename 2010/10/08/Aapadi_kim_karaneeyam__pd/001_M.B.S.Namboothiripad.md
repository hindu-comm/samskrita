A story regarding the verse which I had heard in my childhood is as follows:



kAkkashsheri bhaTTatiri काक्कश्शेरि भट्टतिरि who is famous for defeating uddanda sastri उद्दण्ड शास्त्री in the court of sAmUtiri
सामूतिरि

got enlightenment and started behaving without obeying the laws regarding casteism untouchability etc. So the brahmins of that time wanted to pray lord to purify his mind/intellect. As they did not know what is to be done, they asked Sri. bhaTTatiri regarding this.

The sloka is the dialog between them. As a result of the advise of Sri. bhaTTatiri, they performed the worship of Goddess durga at the temple in chottanikkara (Near Kochi in Kerala) for 12 days in the month of Karkitaka (which starts at Karkata samkrAnti ).

At the end of the puja (bhagavat-seva) Sri. bhaTTatiri had a change of mind and he left Kerala as he found his knowledge of Hindu scriptures is far ahead of the time and is a misfit in the region at that time.

In memory of this the puja is performed in chottanikkara temple every year during the said month.
