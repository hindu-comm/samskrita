Devanagari letters - Part 2  

The next two vowels are - ऋ लृ  
ऋ Pronunciation is transliterated by using "Ru". Actual pronunciation sounds similar to "ru".  
But "ru" रु is a consonant र् + vowel उ  
whereas "ऋ" is a vowel.  
  
Just as र् + उ = रु  
consonant + vowel = letter  
Similarly क् + ऋ = कृ   
  
Letter is called as varNa वर्ण or akShara अक्षर  
varNa वर्ण or akShara अक्षर are morphologically complete, hence called as akShara अक्षर literally meaning "one, does that does not suffer further."  
Vowels are also stand alone varNa वर्ण or akShara अक्षर, as studied in learning the vowels अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ लृ  
But consonants become varNa वर्ण or akShara अक्षर  

-   after a vowel adds into the consonant or  
-   when the consonant is at the end of a word, as in संस्कृतम् The
    ending म् is in its basic consonant form.

There is no English vowel equivalent of ऋ. In Sanskrit it is found in many words. In a dictionary one found some few words starting with ऋ But it is there in-between a word as in संस्कृतम् or कृति  

-   संस्कृतम् = (स् + अ + म् = सं) + (स् + क् + ऋ = स्कृ) + (त् + अ =
    त) + म्  
-   कृति = (क् + ऋ = कृ) + (त् + इ = ति) -   Parenthesis shows the syllabic grouping.  

लृ There is no English equivalent of this vowel also. Even in Sanskrit there are not many words, where this vowel is found. To my mind, (and this is my personal opinion) these two vowels ऋ and लृ along with अ इ and उ make the basic set of five vowel sounds.  
  
All vowels and consonants are groups of five, related to five places in sound-producing places in our mouth, nose and throat system, viz. (1) throat, (2) teeth, (3) gums above the upper teeth, (4) the roof of the mouth and (5) the lips. Nasal sounds are also mixed in sounds emanating from these five places.  
  
In our pronunciation itself we can realize that  

-   अ emanates from the throat  
-   इ emanates from the teeth  
-   उ emanates from the lips -   ऋ emanates from the roof and  
-   लृ emanates from the gums

Why ऋ and लृ are also recognized as vowels even though they have some consonant sound inherent in them is *possibly* they help to make the set of five complete. To such extent I would say (again by my understanding only) these two vowels are "theoretical" vowels !  
  
All these five basic vowels are also pronounced long !  
आ ई ऊ ( I am not able to get proper representation of long ऋ and लृ in Google's transliteration. I would be able to get it in BARAHA and I shall do that when I shall do from the laptop on which I have BARAHA)  
  
As said in my previous message by pairs of short and long these 10 vowels shall be said sequentially as -  
अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ (ऋ long) लृ (लृ long)  
Hope, you will like this.
