Thank you all for taking the trouble write and for giving me your advice, and especially S. L.

It will be of benefit to others as well.





It’s a for leisure. I am not young. And I don't like classrooms! So forums such as this are the ideal for me.





My interests lie in the Darśanas and such works. I have some such books - paper and electronic. Some provide all three forms of the scripts - संस्कृत, Saṁskṛta, and Sanskrit. But very often I read something like 'there is no exact equivalent in English', and from then on only the Sanskrit is used - to the extent that before very long, most of an 'English' format sentence appears in as Saṁskṛta and left none the wiser, and I'm wanting my money back!



That leaves the tried and tested, do it yourself method - to be able to read original Saṁskṛta.



Don’t tell anyone, but I’m cheating with the संस्कृत and Saṁskṛta! I copy & past the संस्कृत from an existing e-mail. Then again into one of these magic software script converters - I trust that they are accurate!



I don't want to speak it, to worship or make sacrifice. And certainly not to be able to sing in it.



There are quite a few of you that are giving their advice, thank you, one and all.



Eddie
