Namaste Shri Eddie,

I am sure other friends of ours would help you how to do it, and that  
ever friendly Shri Abhyankar-ji has already started doing it, but I  
think the tutorial from Charles Wikner, available from Sanskrit Docs  
has a very nice one. One of my friends learnt from it pretty quickly.

Here is the link:

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tutorial_wikner/index.html>  
(Note that some tables in later part of the above tutorial (page  
numbers 73-74 or 83-84) teach Maheshvara Sutras implicitly. Also, I  
keep referring to the table of arrangement of alphabets according to  
sthAna and prayatna: the fundamental property of savarNa.)

Also, you could refer to the ongoing work by Shri Shashikant Joshi too.

Hope this helps!  
namaste  
Ramakrishna
