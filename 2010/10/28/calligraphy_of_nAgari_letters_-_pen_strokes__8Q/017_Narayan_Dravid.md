A very sad news. Sri Desiraju was a 'karmayogi', doing his bit till the last for Samskritam, his passion. I had seen his emails in the past; they were way high above my level. But I didn't realise how old he could be until I saw his photo-snap at his web site. May God give strength to his son and rest of the family to bear this calamity. Our group will be much poorer without his participation. Narayan Dravid
