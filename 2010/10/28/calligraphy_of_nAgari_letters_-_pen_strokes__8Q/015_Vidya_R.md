**Sri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao - He has been a great scholar and has proved to be very resourceful to the Samskrita community (as seen by the mailing list members). He must equally have been a source of knowledge, inspiration, and other things in his life outside this mailing list's scope.**

**  
**

**I pray for a smooth conduct of the final rituals and preparations for his life here-after. I also pray for the realization of his heart's desire for his journeys beyond.**

**  
**

**May his near and dear draw strength from his past to cope with the loss of****Sri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao.**
