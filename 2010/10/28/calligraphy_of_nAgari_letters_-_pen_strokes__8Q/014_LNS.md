In Tamil the word used for the young of a banana tree is 'calf' not  
'sapling'. The implication is that the calf too like the parent, like  
the young one of a kamadhenu, will yield much fruit for many years.  
  
Having enjoyed the fruits of Sri Hanumantha Rao's labors over  
Jayadeva's Gitagovinda, Raghuvamsa, Valimki Ramayana and other such  
classics, one now has his son coming up to serve us. I already know  
the Devanagari alphabet but my children don't. To them it would be  
useful. As Sri Hanumantha Rao has helped us, his son is helping our  
children.  
  
Truly, Sri Hanumantha Rao is a Kainkarya chakravarthi.
