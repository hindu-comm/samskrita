Dear Sanskrit-Lovers,  
  
Much information about Sanskrit programs have been given by Sri Ramesh ji. In addition, I want to mention the website in which updates about the Sanskrit TV- programs by IGNOU or DD Bharati/DD India are given. The website is :  
 <http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/tvschedule.htm>  
  
Also, some of the earlier shown videos are on sale.The links for this are:  
 <http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/publication/av.pdf>  
 <http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/dis.htm> (see "Sanskrit Language  
 Teaching..." link at the bottom)  
  
I hope this might be of some interest to some of you.
