Dear all,

Today morning at 06:30 hrs a sanskrit programme was aired by DD-Gyandarshan channel in its simplest way.

The teacher was Dr. H.S.Vishvaasah and it was excellent. I understand this programme is a joint venture between Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthaan and Samskrita Bharati , Bangalore.

I love to watch these programmes continuously .

if anyone know the timings of the sanskrit programmes in DD-Gyandarshan channel or in any channelpleaseinform so that all of us would be benefitted.

This was followed by a programme "Bhaasha Mandaakini" by TirumalaSanskrit university onthe topic Science & sanskrit.

Today it was on Underground water & Vedas



Thanks
