Here are some thoughts about soma:

The drink was hallucinogenic and gave strength – ie Indra drunk a lot of soma; according to the Vedas it was bought by a bird possibly from the slopes of the Himalayas and was increasing difficult to find as the Vedic peoples moved East on the Gangetic plains since later texts allow substitutes. Also there was a grinding stone and a sieve was used.
Sometimes there is reference to its being a white fluid. It was also identified with the moon. It is unlikely to be tea.
