Greetings, list:



a family friend has been insisting there's a sloka describing soma as a green leaf, dried, pressed, giving a brown drink in infusion, which makes the drinker more energetic; and that the description could only refer to tea. He has asked me to provide him with expert opinion backing up his interpretation.



I'd never heard this interpretation, but I'll acknowledge that my studies were almost exclusively undertaken outside of India. Is it truly a common understanding among Sanskrit scholarsin India that "soma" is actually simply tea?



Thank you for any suggestions,



--M. Radhakrishnan
