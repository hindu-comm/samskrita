Sir ! vedic hymns praise a lot for Soma but soma is definately not the TEA. som has over 19 meanings in sanskrit. i have collected these 19 meanings in my book.

Soma basic is a plant that is used for ritual Homa ( a religious sacrifying in the fire with chanting of mantras ) by extracting its juice with the presence of particular constilation on a full moon night because moon is the god of all plants.

it is also believed that this plant is shining like silver while there is full moon in the sky and only two places were there in entire earth where the palnt was available, 1 is the Himalayan range and 2nd is the coastal area of Saurastra where the first jyotirling Somanath exixt today. som+nath these 2 wordshave highly attracked mesince last24years because it has many amazing facts and till date i am astonished with the greatness of the almighty in htis regards.

will not write more here -will say only that the Soma never is myth. Soma is divine and one who want to realise the divineness of the Soma either have to visit the Himalaya or have to visit PRABHAS - the place of first jyotirling. i claim this because i belongs to Prabhas - Gujarat.

expert comments will be honoured.
