Mr or Mrs Moderator,

  
Yes, of course. I agree entirely.

However, you are don't seem to be replying to an e-mail that was actually  
written, but to something else. Please, what was written and what it is  
that I am actually saying that is silly, is the making of an invitation,  
written in English, to an English media Forum, inviting people to read a  
tutorial to learn Sanskrit, when the tutorial is in Devanāgarī!

This, by the same "Sanskritist" who states that , "absolutely phonetic; no  
confusions of spelling and diacritics etc." as his reason in avoiding Roman  
Transliteration, even though IAST, sanctioned by the Indian government ...  
allows a lossless transliteration of Devanāgarī (and other Indic scripts,  
such as Śāradā script), and as such represents not only the phonemes of  
Sanskrit, but allows essentially phonetic transcription (e.g. Visarga ḥ is  
an allophone of word-final r and s). iti.

Again, from another defender of the faith, we have: "for 1600 years people  

were contended learning Sanskrita in Sanskrita or other Indian languages."  

And well they might have been (past imperfect), but what about non-people  
people - us people here, from the big wide World at large?

Silly or what?

Those that genuingly care for Sanskrit, should check out  
<http://www.ibiblio.org/sanskrit>, as an example of Sanskritists that give  
Sanskrit a good name - it comes complete not only with phonetic  
transcription but also with phonetic pronunciation.

  
I rest my case!

Eddie
