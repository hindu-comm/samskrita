Apologies the scheme I used is not HK but IAST

**International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration** (**IAST**).

It is OK and represents all the sounds and can be digitised. However I agree with Naresh Mahodaya.

Of course it is useful to read Devanageri if you want to get to source texts in original, but is it not essential to use Devanageri if you are just starting off learning the language.
