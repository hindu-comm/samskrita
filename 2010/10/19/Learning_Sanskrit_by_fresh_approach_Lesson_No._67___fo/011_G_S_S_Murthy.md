I learnt devanagari and Kannada script together before I learnt English. I find it hard to understand why anybody would want to learn Sanskrit without learning devanagari script.  
I am one of those who believe that Sanskrit should be learnt not only to delve into the existing vast writings in Sanskrit but also to promote its usage as a medium of modern communication.  
We need to come up with a standard set of words for denoting artifacts relevant to modern living.  
In fact Internet is an ideal medium for interaction between Sanskrit enthusiasts to arrive at such a set.  
I would like to know the views of others in promoting this idea.
