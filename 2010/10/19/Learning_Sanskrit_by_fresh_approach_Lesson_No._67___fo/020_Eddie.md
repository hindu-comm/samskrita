S. L.



 What you are saying is that your ‘Learning Sanskrit by a fresh approach’ is really only intended for native Hindi speakers.



I think I can speak out for the international members of this group, which is after all, an English language based group – French, German, Russian, Taiwanese . . . when I ask

why are you using the Latin script for your heading – it is attracting English readers, keen to learn Sanskrit – only for us to get the Saṃskṛta in Devanāgarī and their meanings - also in Devanāgarī, albeit it Roman Transliteration with the odd few English words dotted about! It is not a lot of use to anyone that isn’t already familiar with Sanskrit and its script.



You are one of these Sanskritists, that give Sanskrit a bad name!





"**लुङ् (**luṅ)

 • (in gram.) N. of the terminations of the Aorist or Third Preterite and N. of that Tense itself. \[904,1\]



 Even though there is no aorist tense in the English language, It is easily understood as “a form of the past tense, that expresses a past action without indicating whether the action was on-going at the time in question (the past imperfect tense) or whether the action was completed (past perfect tense), and called by some the past indefinite tense!



It is ‘indefinite’, even to the learned ones. I quote from Coulson:

“... and the aorist became a learned formation little used in simple Sanskrit. In classical literature it takes its place beside the imperfect and the imperfect as a narrative tense.”



Although he doesn’t elaborate on ‘narrative tense ’, I don’t think he talking in a grammatical sense.



Yes, of course there is more to the aorist, for the academics, but for readers and beginners, it serves only to send them to sleep . . .





Please feel free to explain the aorist in native Sanskrit if you must, but in doing so, please add transliteration in standard IAST, as many like myself soon tire of copying and pasting squiggles into an auto squiggle-to-Roman transliterator, of which there are many!

 2000 years, and still they are still coming out with their tutorials, teaching Saṃskṛta Grammar.

Native Indian PH.D’s in Sanskrit have difficulty making sense of it.



While it is indeed most difficult (i.e. awkward) language to make sense of, it being lauded as the most ‘perfect’ of grammars, hides the fact that whereas there is indeed a lot of sense in it, there is quite a bit there that has no sense in the first place, rather imperfect!



Perhaps it is neither perfect not imperfect – a bit aorist, maybe.
