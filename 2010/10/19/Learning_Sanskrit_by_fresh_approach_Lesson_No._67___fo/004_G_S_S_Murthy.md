Dear Ms. Anand,  
Pl install Baraha 7.0 with BarahaIME ([www.baraha.com](http://www.baraha.com)). Read through its Help file and you will be able to work in Devanagari script without any problem. You can work on all Windows applications like Word, Excel etc.I presume it will be possible to use it for your Sanskrit projects too.  
Best wishes  
Murthy
