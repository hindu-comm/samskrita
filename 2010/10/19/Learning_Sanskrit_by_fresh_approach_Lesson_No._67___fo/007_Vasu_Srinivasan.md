abhyankar mahodaya  
  
can you please elaborate on #4 - "the devanagiri script is thoughtfully designed"  
  
I'm not questioning the validity, usage aspects of it, but I have not really found much discussion on the design aspects of it.  
  
I feel that there is alot of "non-symmetry" in the script. for eg  
  
the vertical lines appears non-uniformly in characters (some as part of character, some as part of dIrgha);  
dIrgha is done either by adding a vertical line (aa) or curve on top (ii) or curve on side (uu) or curve on down (R) etc.  
L (kLpta) and lru (lrut) is difficult to distinguish  
  
it would be great to know your thoughts on that..
