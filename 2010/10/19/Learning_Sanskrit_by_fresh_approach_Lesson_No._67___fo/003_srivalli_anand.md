Dear Shri, Murthy,  
  
I have been a regular recipient f all the mails that come in this group. Though repeated instructions have been given, i have failed to install the sanskrit lipi software. Could you please guide me with the same? Would it also help me in the submission of projects for my college topics? I mean, that I am a Sanskrit Student in the P/G level and am preparing for the NET course, would I be able to use the same for my college assignments as well?  
Regards,  
Srivalli Anand
