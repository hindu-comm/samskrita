If I understand Vidyaji's problem correctly, the manner in which compound letters in which "r" is a part is represented in devanagari script is somewhat different from other compound letters. Normally, what is pronounced first is shown in a truncated manner and what comes later is shown full, in case of a compound letter consisting of two consonants. If however र् (रेफ) comeslater in a संयुक्ताक्षर like inक्रit appears truncatedand क् which should really get truncated is shown full! This is an exception. Just as त्र and क्ष and ज्ञ assume special shapes, we need to accept this peculiarity.

Those who know Kannada script will agree that almost as a rule what should be shown truncated is shown full and what should be shown full is truncated!

ಕ್ಯ,ಕ್ತ,ಕ್ವ etc.

Does this help?
