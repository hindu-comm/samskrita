A few points to be made here:  
  
Thanks to Abhyankar ji for the ongoing series. Clearly, many people like it and we hope it continues to go strong. He is free to choose Devanagari / English script / transliterated script depending on his preference. I echo his comments that one should learn Devanagari because that makes it easier to read more.  
  
Now, I know beginners may have difficulty to read Devanagari fluently - so here's a solution that would work on Windows machines. Download and install baraha. Open BarahaConvert (which is part of the baraha package). Copy/paste the Devanagari portion in there and convert it to unicode / Roman transliteration. Copy / paste the output to some suitable word processor (e.g., MS Word) for easier reading.  
  
  
To the point about Devanagari being 'thoughtfully designed' etc. I think Devanagari, like other scripts, has had a natural evolution. People's preference got incorporated over time and it morphed into the form that we see today.  
  
One can write perfectly good Sanskrit in transliterated English text. Just as one can write perfectly good Sanskrit using Sharada script or Kannada script or Telegu script or Grantha script etc.. (I understand that Grantha script does not have the ambiguity that Tamil script has).  
  
  
And yes, there are several transliteration schemes out there - some more idiosyncratic than others. And Harvard Kyoto transliteration is one of the more idiosyncratic ones - whoever thought that using "z" for "sh" was a good idea?! Ugh.  
  
Itrans and baraha are both easier to read. Although I don't care for the way halanta is treated in Itrans. (Having to use .h to force halanta -- I realize it is because of Hindi. Still, just plain annoying).  
  
  
Speaking of serious Western scholars - I would hope they read Devangari!
