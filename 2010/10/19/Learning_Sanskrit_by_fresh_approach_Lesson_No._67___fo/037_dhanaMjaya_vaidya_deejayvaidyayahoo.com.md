Yes. Thanks to Shri. Abhyankar for this series.  
  
Shri. Abhyankar is doing the best he can do. If it is convenient for  
him to compose his lessons in devanAgarI, we should respect that.  
  
After all, even for the English language, the roman script and the  
traditional orthographic (spelling) rules are quite idiosyncratic. The  
only reason we stick to them is the convenience of not breaking with  
tradition. If someone wants to write a course of English lessons in  
the roman script with its strange spelling rules, they should not be  
drawn into some barren controversy about using the International  
phonetic alphabet instead. (It is obvious that the IPA is more  
unambiguous at rendering English sounds than the Roman script with the  
traditional spelling.)  
  
If someone does not want to learn the devanAgarI script, but still  
wants to read Shri. Abhyankar's lessons, they should take the help of  
a transliterator. Someone (or a computer program) can convert all of  
Shri. Abhyankar's lessons into Harvard-Kyoto or whatever their  
favorite script may be.  
  
Shri. Abhyankar's time and skill is better spent composing lessons  
rather than learning to type in Harvard-Kyoto.  
  
If someone thinks that they have the right to manage Shri. Abhyankar's  
time better than he currently sees fit, they should convince him off  
the email list. Spare us.  
  
(I happen to disagree with Shri. Abhyankar that the devanAgarI script  
is logically constructed, etc. Any script is fine in theory. No  
script, pure auditory transmission is even better. Yet I tend to agree  
with his practice. Because of my personal experience of learning the  
devanAgarI script as a child, I can read and write saMskRta much  
faster in the devanAgarI script than in some other script. If I had  
learned some other script, that script would be more time-saving. If  
anyone wants interfere in managing MY time because they prefer THEIR  
time to be saved, I will ask them very brusquely to stop bothering me.  
Thus I am sympathetic to Shri. Abhyankar.)  
  
Back to my English analogy: If someone will not read Shakespeare  
except when his works are printed in the international phonetic  
alphabet, I respect their ideological purity. But if they ask me to  
stop writing about Shakespeare's work with traditional English  
spelling, if they insist that I learn and write in the international  
phonetic alphabet, if they accuse me of medieval-ism that gives  
Shakespeare a bad name, I will ask them to take a break and leave me  
alone.

Dhananjay

\> \> Dear friends  
\>  
\> \> There is a standard transliteration - diacritics with Roman script - used  
\> \> by all serious Western scholars. I think it is called the Harvard Kyoto  
\> \> system. It uses symbols from Arial Unicode font in Microsoft Office 2004 –  
\> \> this has all the symbols, and I have programmed my keyboard with the  
\> \> shortcuts. I have transliterated part of KaU and this follows:  
\>  
\> \> ṛtam pibantau sukṛtasya loke guhᾱm praviṣṭau parame parᾱrdhe,  
\> \> chᾱyᾱ-tapau brahma-vido vadanti, pañcᾱgnayo ye ca triṇᾱciketᾱḥ (1)  
\>  
\> \> yas setur ījᾱnᾱnᾱm akṣaram brahma yat param,  
\> \> abhayam titīrṣatᾱm pᾱram nᾱciketaṁ śakemahi (2)  
\>  
\> \> ᾱtmᾱnaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi, śarīraṁ rathameva tu  
\> \> buddhiṁ tu sᾱradhiṁ viddhi, manaḥ pragraham eva ca (3)  
\>  
\> \> There is no problem with this at all and is used by scholars in the field.  
\> \> However I am not sure if this will be read OK by e-mail on your computers,  
\> \> so I would be interested in your feedback.

\> \> Dear Mr. Dave,  
\>  
\> \> I appreciate your interest in studying Sanskrit. But I have a few concerns  
\> \> of my own in composing the lessons in English script.  
\>  
\> \> (1) There is quite some difficulty in spelling many Devanagari letters  
\> \> appropriately.  
\>  
\> \> (2) There is lack of standardisation regarding which keyboard character(s)  
\> \> would spell which Devanagari character.  
\>  
\> \> (3) Many transliteration packages are available which work well with  
\> \> Windows OS I have one for Mac, which is not Unicode and I cannot transfer to  
\> \> the internet.  
\>  
\> \> (4) Since Devanagari script is so thoughtfully designed, my honest and  
\> \> sincere advice to all serious students of Sanskrit will be to learn the  
\> \> script as well.
