Im sorry to say, but you are wrong on several counts.

  
  
"What you are saying is that your ‘Learning Sanskrit by a fresh approach’ is really only intended for native Hindi speakers"  
  

-- Wrong. I am not a native Hindi speaker, neither I see any Hindi influence in SL-ji's approach. Where possible he even quotes Tamil/Dravidian languages. I know a teeny-weeny bit of Sanskrita, I learnt the devanaagiri script the hardway and I thoroughly enjoy both his flow and meander.

  
  
"It is not a lot of use to anyone that isn’t already familiar with Sanskrit and its script."  
  

-- Really, seriously, how could you judge? I know and see there are people passionate about learning Sanskrita and they learn it anywhich way they could get, instead of demanding that knowledge come to them in the format they wish. Please do not judge the utility by your standards.  
  
"You are one of these Sanskritists, that give Sanskrit a bad name!" - Is this supposed to be a comic line? If so, it didnt tickle me.  
  
Ok so you came to learn Sanskrita seeing a latin-script based title, you didnt find what you want, so what ? There are so many different ways to learn Sanskrita, why find fault with something that does not fit you?  
  
Out of the 2000+ years, for 1600 years people were contended learning Sanskrita in Sanskrita or other Indian languages. It is because of learning Sanskrita through English, we are still scratching our heads and bones. A little bit of time spent on devanAgari is worth a lifetime spent on hit-and-run scripts.
