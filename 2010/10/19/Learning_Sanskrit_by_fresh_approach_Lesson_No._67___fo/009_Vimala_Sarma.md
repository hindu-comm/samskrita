Dear friends

There is a standard transliteration - diacritics with Roman script - used by all serious Western scholars. I think it is called the Harvard Kyoto system. It uses symbols from Arial Unicode font in Microsoft Office 2004 – this has all the symbols, and I have programmed my keyboard with the shortcuts. I have transliterated part of KaU and this follows:



ṛtam pibantau sukṛtasya loke guhᾱm praviṣṭau parame parᾱrdhe,  
chᾱyᾱ-tapau brahma-vido vadanti, pañcᾱgnayo ye ca triṇᾱciketᾱḥ (1)



yas setur ījᾱnᾱnᾱm akṣaram brahma yat param,  
abhayam titīrṣatᾱm pᾱram nᾱciketaṁ śakemahi (2)

ᾱtmᾱnaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi, śarīraṁ rathameva tu  
buddhiṁ tu sᾱradhiṁ viddhi, manaḥ pragraham eva ca (3)

There is no problem with this at all and is used by scholars in the field. However I am not sure if this will be read OK by e-mail on your computers, so I would be interested in your feedback.
