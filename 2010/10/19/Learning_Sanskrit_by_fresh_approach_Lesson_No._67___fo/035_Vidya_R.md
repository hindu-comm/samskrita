Namaste!

  

It is unfortunate that because of the lack of clarity in knowing what is intended by the words 'English' / 'Roman' / 'Sanskrit' / 'Devanagari', we have ended up in this convoluted discussion that has gone off in many tangents. The first email was a genuine learner's request to benefit from the consistency demonstrated by Shri SLA.

  

I do have a question on an issue I have tripped up on regularly. When calculating the number of 'akSharAa's in a syllable for laghu, guru, I realize that I have to go back and forth to do the calculation.
Sometimes, I have to do a double take to determine if the half syllable (consonant) is before or after the vowel ->

    for example, let's consider the word 'vakratuNDa' -वक्रतुण्ड.

Visually, in the devanAgarI notation, the vowel 'a' seems to be associated with the consonant 'k'. But, orally, we know right away that the 'a' is associated with 'r'. I have attempted (several times) to master this basic skill of counting 'laghu' and 'guru', but am always on shaky grounds and come away scathed.

  

There is possibly some key that needs to turn in my head for me to get over this stumbling block. And, this key might very well be 'Practice, PRACTICE, Practice'!

  

A good time to remind ourselves of 'sahanAvavatu ...'

Looks like this has been a useful discussion to lay out members' expectations. At this point, it seems that the thread has reached a point of saturation. So unless you have something significantly new to add to the discussion, let us consider the thread closed.  
  
Thanks,
