Namaste Dear all,

I would also like to support the great effort Abhyankarji is making to bring Sanskrit closer to those of us bred on English language and the Roman script.

  

Learning Sanskrit through the Roman script ( with its serious deficiencies and inconsistencies in phonetics) is like learning to swim -with one hand tied behind the back and stones on the legs :).

  

Tomorrow someone might come up with objection to discussing shlokas with reference to Gods from theHindu Pantheon.

This is bound to happen because of the great literary works in Sanskrit have also been written in a country which followed the Hindu pantheon of Gods.



C'mon lets get serious about this - A language should be learnt in its full essence- including the speech, script and spirit.

  

Upendra
