Dear Mr. Dave,  
  
I appreciate your interest in studying Sanskrit. But I have a few concerns of my own in composing the lessons in English script.  
  
(1) There is quite some difficulty in spelling many Devanagari letters appropriately.  
  
(2) There is lack of standardisation regarding which keyboard character(s) would spell which Devanagari character.  
  
(3) Many transliteration packages are available which work well with Windows OS I have one for Mac, which is not Unicode and I cannot transfer to the internet.  
  
(4) Since Devanagari script is so thoughtfully designed, my honest and sincere advice to all serious students of Sanskrit will be to learn the script as well.  
  
Regards,
