Dear Sri.Abhyankar,  
It is indeed painful that your laudable efforts are being subjected to unsavoury adverse comments. There are a large number of Sanskrit enthusiasts who appreciate what you are doing. If anyone wants to learn Sanskrit without learning devanagari script, let him try elsewhere.  
विस्तीर्णा पृथिवी जनाश्च बहवः किं तन्नसम्पद्यते।  
Warm regards
