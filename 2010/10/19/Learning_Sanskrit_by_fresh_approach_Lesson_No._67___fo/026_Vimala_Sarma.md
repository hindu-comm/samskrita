Dear Friends

The only I want to add this to help clarify this debate. There should be a distinction made between language and script. The English language is written in Roman script, like other Latin-based languages, but there are plenty of English words written in devanageri script (see road signs all over India). The Sanskrit language can be written in a variety of scripts, but to-day it is written chiefly Devanageri, but also Roman with diacritics - IAST.

The dhatu for "cross” is written as tṝ in IAST transliteration – hope this displays correctly, and not as squiggles. ( I know many Indian speakers give the u sound to the ṛ vowel but this is not universal) .
However people should chose to write a language in whatever script is easiest for them. It is not known if Pannini himself used a script and if so what.

Vimala
