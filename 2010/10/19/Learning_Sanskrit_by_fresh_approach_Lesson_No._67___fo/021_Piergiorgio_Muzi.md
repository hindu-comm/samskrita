Dear MrAbhyankar,

I can only agree with you about the importance of studying a language from inside and learning the grammatical explanations of their traditional scholars and theoreticians. But, as happens also for every human science, knowledge from inside needs to be integrated with knowledge from outside.

An Italian teacher of Italian language can't understandclearly all the subtle aspects of his language, if he doesn't accept also general cross-linguistic approach to his traditional notionsand disregardsthe use of English or other modern languages for grammaticalexplanation.Using is not knowing. We can go on bicycle, but we have no clear ideas about how.The same we can say about the complementation of diachronical and synchronical knowledge in spite of the fact that present linguistics favours the synchronical approach.There is an enormous difference between the teachers of Italian who knowsLatin and those who don't.Some of the most important notion of Italian linguistics have been built amid of the modern general linguistic research and using English language to publish them.

Using English terminology for grammar doesn't meanto forceall the grammatical categories of Sanskrit or Italian into the ones of English language, which has no perfect, no imperfect, no aorist, but simple past (+ periphrasticpast tenses, etc.). English terminology hasalready incorporated Latin and Old-Greek grammar's categories since centuries ago. For instance, aorist is not a tense of English, but a tense of Old-Greek. The justification of the word "aorist" is that Sanskrit and Old-Greek have the same morphological structure (and also the same polymorphism, with sigmatic and a asigmatic forms, etc), even if along the history of Old Greek, as well along the history of Sanskrit there were a lot of changes. This is enough to understand each other and also to be encouraged to study thereasons andways of development of languages. In this case, for instance, while in Old-Greek, the aorist, which originallyexpressed a "perfective aspect" (very probably, see Speijer, Szemerenyi...),tended to be used as an historical past tense. In Sanskrit we know that the difference between those three "tenses" in Vedic becamevague during classical period of theSanskrit literature. Of course, the matter is much more complicated, but I don't believe that we can find simplification by closing ourselves insidearbitrary borders.

When Sanskrit was discovered inWestern world, some Latin- and Old-Greek-philologists refused to recognize the kinship of Sanskrit and their "classical languages" and said a lot of stupid things aboutthosesuch evident connections. Unluckily only a minority of scholars opened their minds to the treasures of India and gave their passionate work and life tounderstand and learn them.Their knowledge of Latin was enriched a lot andthe linguistic studies had an enormous advancement.I believe that working inside and outside the borders is what we need in modern world too much divided in spite of a commercial (and terribly westernizing) global civilization. Globality is not universality...

This is enough for now, but I admit that there are possible objections, which I don't want to avoid.

P.S. Of course there are some pervert aspects of "anglism",mainlyin Sanskrit transliteration. For instance the horrible ee to spell long i, or oo to spell log o, or the confusing ch for voiceless palatal stop, and sh, which has been used for each kind offricative sound... But these facts reflect only the defective knowledge of general phonology, if they have not to be forgiven for historical or practical reasons.
