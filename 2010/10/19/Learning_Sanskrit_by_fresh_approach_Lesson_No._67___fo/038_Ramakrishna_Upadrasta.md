namaste,

My thoughts are same as Shri Dhananjay's, Thanks to Shri Abhyankar-ji  
for his series and he is free to choose whichever script he prefers.

I read the thread again. If an teacher chooses to use a text book or a  
mode of teaching, which has been well accepted in a community, though  
not accepted in its entirety, it is entirely for a student to choose  
to attend the classes, or instead attend another which suits his/her  
own choice.

Instead, resorting to mud-slinging (like labeling "... Sanskritists,  
that give Sanskrit a bad name", "2000 years ...") is indeed in very  
poor taste and I hope that it does not happen in future in this forum.  
We do not need a indologists vs. traditionalists debate in everything  
we discuss!

praNAms to all sanskrit lovers  
Ramakrishna

Currently I prefer ITRANS a little more because some of forums I write  
in do not still allow devanaagari, and it allows one to use the same  
encoding, with minor tweaks to post the same sanskrit-itrans text in  
my mother language: Telugu. Also, it allows one to search for words in  
the itx files, using simple text editors like vim. When some of the  
problems with the fonts have been standardized, including converters,  
I would have no doubt in completely shifting.
