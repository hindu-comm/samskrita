***Namaste  
Yes Shobha Saraiya, I deeply agree and I must confess that when the first time I read about Learning Sanskrit By a Fresh Approach in English as Well, I become afraid of the results. Can look selfish but I spent some years learning the Devanagari and I spent this years making efforts and loving all what I was doing, since some years I have the pleasure to write a lot using the Devanagari. All the languages I have learned and they are a few, I could not imagine learn any one without the respective alphabet(s). Out of the alphabet(s) I would loose the soul of them.  
This is my humble believe  
Sincerely yours  
***
