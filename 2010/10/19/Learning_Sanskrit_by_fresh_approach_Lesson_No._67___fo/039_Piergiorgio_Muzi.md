Dear Mr Dhananjay and all friends,  
I much appreciate your open-minded observations and the appropriate  
comparisons, you have done. They seem to be an invitation to dialogue  
between traditionalists and indologists. There are indeed a lot of possible  
hints and advices to improve our views with courage and modesty. BTW,  
indologists learned a lot not only from the corpus of Sanskrit texts, but  
also from the Indian grammarians. The precious Sanskrit Syntax, written by  
Speijer at the late XIX century is full of quotations from Panini and other  
Indian grammarians. And what to say about Max Muller, Monier-Williams,  
MacDonell, etc.? At present the cultural (and geopolitical) world scene is  
quite different. But this doesn't mean that what true and universal was  
searched for or incompletely caught in India or elsewhere must be forgotten  
or deleted anyhow. I believe that an open and universalistic attitude like  
the one of Bhartrhari in the field of human language(s) could be appropriate  
to reciprocal understanding. This without dogmatisms:  
असंसारं जगत्यस्मिन्नेका नित्या ह्यनित्यता।  
Regards,  
Piergiorgio
