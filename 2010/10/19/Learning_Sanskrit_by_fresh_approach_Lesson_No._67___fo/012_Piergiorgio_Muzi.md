Dear friends, I strongly agree with Ms Vimala about the utility of Harvard-Kyoto convention for transliteration. This doesnot only match the devanAgarI script, but it is respectful of principles of general phonology, avoiding very common confusion among beginners, like using th for a dental t, or ee fora long i, or ch for c...(therefore thehorrible "geethaa"...).To get it, starting from a particular form of Itrans,I use the system provided by[www.omkarananda-ashram.org](http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org)

Do you know any better in order to get a uniform application of it to softwares of allcomputers of ours?

The following is an example of application:

भगवद्गीता।पुरुषः।ब्रह्म। आत्मा। संस्कृतम्। पाणिनिः। पठति।

bhagavadgītā puruṣaḥ \|brahma\| ātmā\| saṁskṛtam\| pāṇiniḥ\| paṭhati\|

Thanks, Piergiorgio
