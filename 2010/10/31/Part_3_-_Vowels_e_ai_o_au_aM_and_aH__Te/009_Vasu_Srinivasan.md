abhyankar mahodaya:  
  
bengaluru is actually a corruption of "benda kaalu ooru" (benda = baked, kaalu = grains, ooru = city). Im not sure of the story behind it, I have heard it goes like some one asked for food and was given baked grains, so the place was called benda kaalu ooru. This later became bengaluru.  
  
Also bangle in Kannada is "bale" (Tamil: valayal).  
  
Down south there are too many places that are corrupted by the British and unfortunatley still in vogue - Thanjavur -> Tanjore, Nagapattinam -> Nagapatam, Tiruvanantapuram -> Trivandrum etc, so several meaningful places became corrupted.  
  
upendra mahodaya:  
  
i know in classical sanskrita La is not there, but what about in vedic sanskrita. I cant remember where, but ive heard some one say La is in vedas.  
  
Thanks!  
Vasu
