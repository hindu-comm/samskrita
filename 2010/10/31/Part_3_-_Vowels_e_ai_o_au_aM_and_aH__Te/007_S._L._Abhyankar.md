Dear Mr. Hans Nilsson,  
  
You have riased an interesting point about Pronunciation of ओ with or without diphthong. Frankly, I did not understand the full implication of your statement -

  
In all I have seen on devanagari, this represents the pure long ”o” sound, without the diphtong of ”goat” or ”go” of native English pronounciation. However, this sound does not exist in English, so an English equivalent can not be stated. The closest one gets is a lengthened ”o” of Bond (as in James Bond). But maybe, when I think about it, you Indians maybe pronounce also ”goat” without diphtong?  
  

I have known pronounciations of "o" in "go" and of "oa" in "goat" to be absolutely identical.  
  
May I cite attention to the mention that the mixed vowels become sort of starting points of the concept of सन्धि ?  
Examples of अ + उ = ओ or अ + ऊ = ओ are सूर्य + उदय = सूर्योदय । शीत + ऊष्ण = शीतोष्ण ।  
In all Indian languages अ + उ = ओ or अ + ऊ = ओ is a uniform concept and style of pronunciation.  
The rules of सन्धि also dictate when to pronounce अ + उ = ओ and when not to do that. For example अर्जुन उवाच will stay as such, and not become अर्जुनोवाचbecause अर्जुन उवाच has visarga in अर्जुनः उवाच dropped.  
I wonder whether this response approaches your questions appropriately, appropriate to your thoughts on the point.   
सस्नेहम्
