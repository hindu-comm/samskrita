नमो नमः श्रीमन् "वासु श्रीनिवासन्"-महोदय !  
Thanks for the interesting info about the derivation of "Bengaluru"  
  
I won't call it "corruption" of the names by the British. They are habituated to such accents, where tongue does not have to twist as much. So they have difficulty to pronounce Indian names properly. In turn they did spellings as per the pronunciations with which they were comfortable.  
  
Even after granting that, "Ellora" in place of verooL वेरूळ does not stand to logic. I wonder, whether spelling of "Ellora" was prompted by the name of the other famous city "Vellore" and the spelling of "Ellora" was desired to be different from that of "Vellore"  
  
Calling the British spellings as "corruption" sounds as some expression of anguish or disgust. That feeling is not healthy, not good for our own health. And all that happened in history. Can we change history ? Why spoil our health now, for that ? Let bygone be bygone ! Would you agree ?
