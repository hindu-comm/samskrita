**ऐ**  
Is'nt itthis close enough to the "i" in 'idea'? as we say 'Aishwaraya' and begin it with this letter while writing in devnagari?

Are there any sanskrit or Hindi word that begins with short a-e sound (as in'elephant' or 'at' - as opposed to 'ale' or 'ate' ? The latter are common .

Is Ellora (as in the caves) a word of Indian orgin??
