नमो नमः श्रीमन् "वासु"-महोदय,  
Thanks for raising some interesting points. My responses are -  
1) I have seen the word "idea" written in देवनागरी as आय्-डिया or as आयडिया by the IDEA MOBILE people.  

-   In the pronunciation of ऐ the sound of य is not there, as is clear
    from pronunciation of ऐश्वर्या। -   In the pronunciation of IDEA the sound of य is very much inherent.

2\) I think ELLORA is certainly an English spelling. I think we must check the name of the village/place near Ellora. In India we have many names of places ending in पूर e.g. विजापूर रामपूर बेंगलूरु  

-   पूर is certainly from Sanskrit word पुरम् -   I know also for certain that in Kannada ऊरु means a village -   In fact I have a guess that बेंगलूरु = बेन्गल् + ऊरु -   I think, in Kannada बेन्गल् means "Bangle". Some time in history,
    the place might have been famous for "Bangles". Or -   बेन्गल् could have been optional pronunciation of the Tamil word
    पेन्गल् which means "Ladies". It might have been a place where
    ladies had dominance or the place had a matriarchal society. -   In Karnataka, Kittur is a place where Chennamma चेन्नम्मा was the
    warrior queen who, I think, defeated even शिवाजी There are places
    known for dominance by famous ladies. झान्सी is of course the most
    shining example. Again the name Kittur has ऊरु in it.

The English spelled many names of places in India, only according to the pronunciation, which they were comfortable with. They spelled अलिपूर as Alipore, मुम्बई as Bombay, विजापूर as Bijapore, (In fact वबयोरभेदः पबयोरभेदः are recognised as acceptable pronunciational variants !)  
  
Ellora seems to be similar. I think the name of the place is वेरूळ In English spelling ळ has come before र, unless the correct name of the place is वेळूर which would then also have ऊर in it. Then वेळूर being spelled as Ellora seems logically close.
