Dear all,



I am a bit surprised by this statement:  
  

ओ (= अ + उ) or (अ + ऊ) being the sound

-   of "oa" in "goat" -   of "o_e" in "rote"

In all I have seen on devanagari, this represents the pure long ”o” sound, without the diphtong of ”goat” or ”go” of native English pronounciation. However, this sound does not exist in English, so an English equivalent can not be stated. The closest one gets is a lengthened ”o” of Bond (as in James Bond). But maybe, when I think about it, you Indians maybe pronounce also ”goat” without diphtong?



Also Whitney, in his grammar says that the «e» and «o» vowels «are both in India and in Europe usually pronounced as they are transliterated, that is, as long sounds without diphtongal character».



So is thisl correct, or should it also in Sanskrit be pronounced as a slight diphtong?

(I know that historically this vowel is derived from a+u, and even was pronounced like that (in Vedic times?), but that it later changed to become just ”o”)

PS: A very good description of the Devanagari alphabet and the different transliterations can be found on Wikipedia:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari) and

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration>



In my mind, all these transliterations are perfect one-to-one transformations of devanagari.
