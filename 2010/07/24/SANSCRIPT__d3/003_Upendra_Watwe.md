Respected Abhyankarji and all others who have been contributing to the forum,

I wish to convey my deepest thanks toi all of you.

I have been following Abhyankarji's emails with special attention. He writes only in sanskrit and that is what makes the email so much more interesting - to read, and to figure out the meaning.

If some of the learned people on the forum could start writing in sanskrit about- any one topic - maybe thier professional area, or news, we all could benefit by getting first hand knowledge of spoken / conversational sanskrit.

  

Upendra
