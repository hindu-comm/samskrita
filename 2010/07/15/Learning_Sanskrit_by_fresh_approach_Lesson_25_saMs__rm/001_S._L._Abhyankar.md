नमो नमः "अविनाश साठये"-महोदय !  
Thanks from the bottom of my heart !  
How would I say that ? Just धन्यवादाः is not what I want to say.  
(1) Your explanation of आश्चर्य brings to mind -  

चर्य the 'य'-प्रत्ययान्तं धातुसाधितम् of the verb चर्, similar to कार्य from कृ  
With that, आश्चर्यम् = आः इति चर्यम् = (also) यत् आश्चर्यम् कारयति तदपि  
I think आश्चर्यम् is both cause and effect - 7 wonders of the world are all आश्चर्याणि They, as causes, also bring out the effect, आश्चर्यम्  
How about आचार्य ? आदर्शं आचरणं स्वयं आचरति, शिष्यैः आचारयति अतः आचार्यः खलु !  
The word चर्या has possibly two shades of meanings -  

a\) चर्या = face, possibly became चेहरा in Hindi and Marathi  
b) चर्या as in दिनचर्या  

Wow ! How interesting it becomes to delve into the derivation of words !!  
You have offered to send me "the traditional suffixes used". Please oblige.  
My father always insisted that one should shred or pulverize every word down to its smallest particle.  
He also insisted that one must look up every word in the dictionary, even if you think, you know the word. A dictionary as of Apte's gives 18 meanings of the word भग ! This word is certainly an important part in the word भगवान्. Why would one refer to a dictionary when one comes across the word भगवान् ? But if you do not refer to the dictionary, how would you know 18 meanings of the word भग?  
I really wonder what kind of educational system is spreading across the world. Does the system allow any space to the students to delve so deep and enjoy the studies ?  
From your ID, I notice, Mr. Sathaye, that you are in the field of education. You are much better placed to comment on this.  

2\) I need to correct both कर्तरि and the मनुष्याणां missed out in the final translation. In fact the translation given by you is beautiful. I shall straightway adopt that.

  
धन्यवादाः !  
सस्नेहम् ,  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः \|  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"

> 1. The derivation of आश्चर्य is traditionally given as आ इति चर्यते > अभिनीयते इति This is very much like your idea, except it comes > directly from the root. I can give you the traditional suffixes used, > if you desire.  
> 2. I would translate प्रधावन्ति as run around, rather than just run!  
> 3. I wonder why you have दीर्घ इ in कर्तरी whereas you correctly have > कर्मणि. In Marathi spelling this is now allowed, but I don't think > that is your reason(:-))  
> 4. The word मनुष्याणाम् is omitted in final translation.  
> 4. Finally, my suggestion for full translation would be:  
> Hope is indeed an amazing chain for (binding) men; the ones tied down > by it run around, while the ones freed from it sit as if lame. >
