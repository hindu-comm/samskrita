Thank you Mr. Muzi for giving us a candid explanation of Sanskrit Auxiliary Verbs. As a whole it turns out that when a finite verb especially theinflections of *as, aas, sthaa, bhu,* and *kri*, is preceded by agerund, infinitive or participle andadds aspectual meaning to the main verb (gerund etc.) then it should be understood as auxiliary verb. I think the case of *sma* should also be included in the list of these auxiliary verbs as it encodes the aspect of the main verb (which comes inpresent tense) and convey the sense of progressive aspect in past.



Thank you again.



With regrds,

Madhav Gopal
