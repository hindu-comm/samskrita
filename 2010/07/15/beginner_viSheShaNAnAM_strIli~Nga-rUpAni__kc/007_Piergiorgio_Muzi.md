स्वस्ति। अभ्यङ्कर महोदय।

एष गुर्वर्थो विषयः।

auxiliary verbs इति पदं सहायकक्रिया वा सहायक्रिया वेति पदं परिवर्तनीयम्।

नाम इति पदं भवदुदाहरणे क्रिया नास्ति।

स निपातो ऽस्ति मन्ये यद्यपि नामेति नामपदादुत्पन्नः।

तत्पदं क्रियाविशेषणमव्ययं वा तद्यथा adverb इति ।

I mean that "auxiliary verb" is not a word which complete the sense of a verb, like an adver; it is not a secondary or optional part but the essential grammatical part of the periphrasticverb, usually the finite form, the one bearing the personal ending and more (ti\~N).

In English if you delete the auxiliary portion from "I have to leave" you obtain "I to leave" which is senseless. The same, if you delete the auxiliary part from "sa IkShAM cakre"you obtain only the "sa IkShAm" which is senseless.But you can delete "nAma" from "saMskRtaM daivIVAk" and you alwaysget a sensed sentence. The same happens inFrench, Spanish, Italian, where "Io sono andato"like "I have gone" looses its meaning, if you delete "sono" or"have".

nAmaindeed in your example is an indeclinable (anvaya) from the noun nAma. In Sanskrit many indeclinable are formedafter adjectives or nouns used in the accusative or otherwise instrumental or ablative cases. Thisan instance ofso-called grammaticalization of lexical items, that is very common in a lot of languages.

BTW, in this period I am involved in studying the reflexive structures in languages. Since Sanskrit is terribly important in this field, I ask for auxiliary(!)suggestions and information around people who are interested in this field in a linguistic, logical, scientific or philosophical attitude.I wish they would put in touch with me! thanks for any sahAya

Thanks, namaste,

Piergiorgio Muzi
