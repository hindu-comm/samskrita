Abhyankar mahodaya

Sorry for using Roman transliteration:

Chandramukhī follows “yogin” paradigm – possessing a moon-face, hence -
sg masc nom, hence fem would be chandramukhinī

Chandramukha: is bahuvriddhi – one whose face is the moon – sg nom masc. Follows Rama paradigm; hence fem would be chandramukhā following senā paradigm

If the above is to be a karmadārya compound, chandramukha: rāma: if nominative; but will agree with the noun in number case and gender.

Vimala
