Svasti. I have read your interesting observations about auxiliary verbs in Sanskrit and I allow myself to add something to that issue. I refer only to verbs, of course, since talking about “auxiliary words” or other construction has no definite technical reference. Though, even in general linguistics, the category “auxiliary verb” is rather “fuzzy”. The Oxford Reference Grammar, of Greenbaum, reports (for English) primary auxiliary (to be, to have, to do), modal auxiliary (can, may, could, should…) and marginal auxiliary (used to, ought to…). You can also add the verbs wanting bare infinitive: let, dare, need, make…but here the borders are really indefinite (consider the perception verbs with bare infinitive…).

In Sanskrit morphosyntactical auxiliary verbs in narrow sense are used mainly in periphrastic constructions, that is:

Periphrastic future (gantA-asmi), periphrastic perfect (bodhayAm-Asa; IkSaM cakre; bibharAM babhUva). So they are: asti, karoti and bhavati..

This is according to Speijer (Sanskrit Syntax, par. 312). For him we can consider also asti, Aste, tiSThati, vartate, when used to express progressive meaning with present or even past participles (Agacchan vartate = he is coming). Spejer gives also a broader sense to auxiliary verbs in par. 310, including forms where the lexical sense of some verbs (the same said before) is weakened and almost empty, like in kathAM karoti to mean karayati. In my opinion this is an excessive generalization.

If we compare Sanskrit with modern languages, we can see that periphrastic constructions are very rare in Sanskrit, given the inflective structure of its grammar. They are as rare as in Latin and Old Greek.

In order to try to give a general definition of a periphrastic form of a verb, I dare say that it is composed by the main verb bearing lexical information, but lacking essential morphosyntactical elements and the auxiliary verb which bears an essential part of morphosyntactical information, without a full lexical meaning. In a typical case the main verb is a gerund, infinitive or participle, the second one is a finite verb, with marks of person, number, tense, mood, etc. In this distribution of roles there are differences between languages and even inside the same language, due to different periphrastic forms we might consider.

This is a draft of my opinions on the topic. I don’t believe that it is immune from criticism. As we can read in R. Langacker, Foundations of cognitive grammar, the matter is very complicate. It is connected to historical process of grammaticalization, so that some verbs loose their original full and concrete meaning and get an abstract or modal one or a mere grammatical function. It is common to the evolution/involution of all languages.

Namaste,

Piergiorgio Muzi
