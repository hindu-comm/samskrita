स्वस्ति।

अभ्यङ्कर महोदय।भवतो संस्कृतसंपूर्णपरिज्ञानं प्रति केवलं नन्तुमर्हामि। अपि नाम भारतमागम्य भवतश्छात्त्रो भवेयमेकदा। धन्यवादः॥

Dear Madhav,

yes, we can say that **sma** is an auxiliary word, but thatis not a technical linguistic expression, since **sma** is not an auxiliaryverb, not being a verb at all. It is a particle, which modifies the verb like**na** does. But** Na** denies, while **sma**gives a present tense a past reference. Besides, sometimes it is only apure expletive particle. Auxiliary verbs are fully and plainly verbs and have essential functions. Appreciations for your deep commitment in grammar!

Namaste,

Piergiorgio Muzi
