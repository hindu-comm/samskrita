Usha mahodaye,  
In terms of ease, speed, fun of Samskrit learning and proficiency gained, \*nothing\* comes close to attending a 10-day Speak Samskrit course by Samskrita Bharati first. They are the leaders in this field. They teach Samskrit like a mother teaches her child her mother tongue - by speaking it from day one. No books, no memorization, no notes, no translations needed.  
  
You will be able to speak in simple Samskrit by devoting just 10 days, 2hrs a day. Why go for books and wrestle with grammar rules, when you can experience the joy of Samskrit-speaking first-hand?  
Once you are initiated into Samskrit speaking, go for online material or SB's correspondence course. They'll be much more effective.  
  
Where are you located? Let me know and I'll find a class nearest to you.  
- Sai.
