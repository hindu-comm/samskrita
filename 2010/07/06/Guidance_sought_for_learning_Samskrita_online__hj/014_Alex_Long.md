\>   Hi, dear Alex,  
\>   I have lived in Singapore and I used to attend Ramakrishna Mission's courses. There you can meet teachers with experience and seriousness. You can refer to me (I was a student of Nivedita Anil Kalaver, who now I suppose left Singapore). Besides, sometimes Anuradha Choudry goes to Singapore to teach spoken Sanskrit. You can question Kiruthika at Shri Aurobindo Association. I can put in touch with other young boys of mine who were my students there.

\>     In terms of ease, speed, fun of Samskrit learning and proficiency gained, \*nothing\* comes close to attending a 10-day Speak Samskrit course by Samskrita Bharati first. They are the leaders in this field. They teach Samskrit like a mother teaches her child her mother tongue - by speaking it from day one. No books, no memorization, no notes, no translations needed.

\>     Once you are initiated into Samskrit speaking, go for online material or SB's correspondence course. They'll be much more effective.

\>      Dear Usha, I recommend youhttp://[slabhyankar.wordpress.com](http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com)(learning Sanskrit by Fresh Approach), since it combines practical step to step lessons with clear notions of grammar. As a reference grammar MacDonell is the best for beginners. But as a study grammar with exercises I would suggest Devavânîpraveçikâ, An Introduction to the Sanskrit Language, OR.UP.Goldman & SO.I. Sutherland Goldman (Motile Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi). Best wishes!
