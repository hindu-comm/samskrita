For the US, the Samskrita Bharati contact info is available through their website:  
<http://samskritabharati.org/>  
  
I found the following email for Portland. Please send a mail and see what happens.  
[port...@samskritabharati.org]()  
  
A similar website with contact info is being built for Samskrita Bharati India. Will be available very soon.
