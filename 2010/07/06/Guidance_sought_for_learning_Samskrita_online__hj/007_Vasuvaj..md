Namaste.  
Initially I thought I'll send a personal reply to the query of Ms.Deepa Duraiswamy.  
Then I thought that there might be others in this group who are from Chennai.  
So here are the details of the Samskrita Bharati office at Chennai:  
  
  
Chennai office address:  
  
Samskrita Bharati  
43-B6, 3rd Floor, Rams Square, No.2, Valluvar Kottam High Road, Nangambakkam, Chennai-600024.  
  
Tel : (044) 2827 2632 / 2827 2639  
E-mail: samskrita...@yahoo.com  
  
Landmark direction :  
  
1. When you go towards Chetpet bridge from Sterling Road, Nungambakkam, you will find the Cooum river crossing.  
  
2. Immediately after the crossing, there is a traffic junction where you will find a Policeman atop a podium regulating the traffic.  
  
3. Take a U-turn at this junction and come back on the same road, crossing the river.  
  
4. The third building on your left is RamSquare building, where you will find the VIP showroom at the ground level. The next building houses the Indusland Bank.  
  
5. Come on the third level towards the eastern wing and you will find our Samskritabharati office.

Wow! I have been meaning to ask Usha's question for long. Shri Abhyankar's lessons are wonderful though I am making slow progress - the discipline to study on one's own is a tough discipline indeed.



Sai, I live in Chennai - do you think there's a Samskrita Bharati class here? I would love to attend.



Thanks,

Deepa
