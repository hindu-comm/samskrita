Hi, dear Alex,

I have lived in Singapore and I used to attend Ramakrishna Mission's courses. There you can meet teachers with experience and seriousness. You can refer to me (I was a student of Nivedita Anil Kalaver, who now I suppose left Singapore). Besides, sometimes Anuradha Choudry goes to Singapore to teach spoken Sanskrit. You can question Kiruthika at Shri Aurobindo Association. I can put in touch with other young boys of mine who were my students there.

Namaste,

Piergiorgio Muzi
