Dear Usha, I recommend you [http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com](http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/) (learning Sanskrit by Fresh Approach), since it combines practical step to step lessons with clear notions of grammar. As a reference grammar MacDonell is the best for beginners. But as a study grammar with exercises I would suggest Devavânîpraveçikâ, An Introduction to the Sanskrit Language, OR.UP.Goldman & SO.I. Sutherland Goldman (Motile Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi). Best wishes!

शुभमस्तु। नमस्ते।
