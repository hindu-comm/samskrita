नमो नमः "माधव गोपाल"-महोदय !  
I guess that your question is prompted by the use and need for auxiliary verbs in English language, especially -  

1.  verb 'be' for passive voice For example does = करोति; 'is' done =
    कृतमस्ति 2.  verb 'do' for interrogative For example you gave; Did you give ? 3.  verb 'have' for present perfect, past perfect, etc. For example, I
    do; I have done 4.  verb 'make' for प्रयोजकाः For example does = करोति; makes do =
    कारयति 5.  auxiliaries for senses

can, could  
shall, should  
will, would  
may, might, must  

I wonder whether the 'auxiliaries' can be called as 'auxiliary verbs'. Rather, I would coin for these a phrase 'verbal auxiliaries'. Of course 'be', 'do' 'have' and 'make' are auxiliary verbs.  
I think प्रत्ययाः is a very charming feature of संस्कृत-भाषा They serve the function of auxiliaries so crisply.  
The 'त्' (न्) प्रत्ययः serves the function of the 'continuous' aspect of tenses कालाः e.g. I am going = अहम् गच्छन् अस्मि ।  
Eminently, the "य, तव्य, अनीय"-प्रत्ययाः can be said to serve much of the functions of auxiliaries, used in English for the 'senses' अर्थाः  
For example,  
something that 'must' be done = कर्तव्यम्  
something that 'should' be done = करणीयम्  
something that 'can'/'cannot' or 'may'/ 'may not' be done = कार्यम् वा अकार्यम् वा  
For "I can do" one can also say अहम् कर्तुम् शक्नोमि । The तुम्-प्रत्ययः is another charming प्रत्ययः  
Interestingly, in this example, शक्नोमि is a complete verb, not an auxiliary verb. Rather, the main action verb कृ has attained a subsidiary status by its getting the तुम्-प्रत्ययः  
The main logic of प्रत्ययाः seems to be to make every word become a 'stand alone' word. That gives so much of freedom from syntax. Freedom from syntax has promoted composition of poetry. And poetry is another charming aspect of संस्कृत-भाषा How beautifully it is said in a सुभाषितम् -  

भाषासु मुख्या मधुरा दिव्या गीर्वाणभारती ।  
तस्माद्धि काव्यं मधुरं तस्मादपि सुभाषितम् ।।  

धन्यवादाः यत् भवतः प्रश्नेन एतद्विचार-मन्थनाय अवसरः प्राप्तः । आशास्ति यत् एतन्मन्थनं भवतः रोचते ।  
सस्नेहम् ,
