Dear Madhav,  
  
The term 'auxiliaries' seems too broad to me. You gave the example of sma as what you thought of as auxiliaries. sma is not a verb - auxiliary or otherwise. It is an avyaya. Sometimes it induces la\~g lakAra of the associated verb, whereas at others it is simply for pAda-pUraNa.  
  
Now, if we are to take auxiliary as something that modifies / qualifies a verb, then one could consider kriyA-visheShaNas as auxiliaries. sA bhRushaM likhati. etc.  
Similarly, upasargas or upasarga-equivalents could be considered auxiliaries.
