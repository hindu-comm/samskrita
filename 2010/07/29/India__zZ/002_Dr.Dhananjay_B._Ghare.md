Dear Shri.Rameshajee,  
 Namaskaara.  
 I have liked the Message you have sent :

  
  
If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it.  

1) **Happy moments, Praise God.  
2) Difficult moments, Seek God.  
3) Quiet moments, Worship God.  
4) Painful moments, Trust God.  
and  
5) Every moment, Thank God**  
  
 Kindly inform me at **[dbg...@hotmail.com]()  
 whether this message is Thought and Written by Yourself or quoted from Saint's Work (Who is the Saint or Sage if so).  
 I am thinking of using it (with some Changes and Modifications - addition to it etc.) in my work and I would like to mention and thank the Original Thinker.  
  
** With regards and Best Wishes  
 Dr.Ghare**,** Friday, 30th July 2010, Seattle**
