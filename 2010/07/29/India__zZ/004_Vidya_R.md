namaste!

  

I have not seen the ppts. I am just responding to the email responses.

  

regarding gaNaadipatiH ->My understanding is that this refers to Ganesha being the overseer of clans such as gaNa's - sivagaNAH -> the Adi -> refers to "other clans such as gaNa"

  

regarding 'pUrNa' -> I look at it as referring to the 'whole'.
pUrNamadaH ... refers to the concept of infinity, and not zero.
At-least upto a certain point, shUnyam and pUjyam refer to zero, and pUrNa refers to infinity.

  

pUrNamadaH ... indeed is a Himalayan concept ...

  

I wish the Bookfair all success, fostering open discussions and comprehension among current and future beneficiaries.

  

Vidya
