Namaste,



IMHO, I’m unsure somebody can say the numbers from so-and-so place. Every society must have had some form of counting. The question really becomes which one first.



If vedic origin is considered earliest possible – or agree that they (Vedas) are *apauruSheyaH*, then the *rudra camaka* mantras contain the numbers in the range of 1 to 10 besides other numbers, and the *vedic* mantras that we recite as part of *mahanyasa* count from one to thirty-three. This alone should say that \***all**\* primary numbers ( I mean 1 to 10) are from India. Zero is anyway attributed to India J.



Thanks

Viswanath
