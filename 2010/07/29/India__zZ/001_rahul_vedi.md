it was with great pleasure that I watched the presntation submitted by you.

wonderful...



However, in slide #4, it says zero was invented by Aryabhatta.

I think (it is my opinion) that zero was used by mathemeticians (and vidvaans) long before the times of aryabhatta.



I think bhagavaan gaNesha is credited with numbers (gaNaadi) including zero (shuunya and puurNa).



Aryabhatta used the existing knowledge (including mathetics, algebra, trigonometry, spherical coordinate geomery and astro-physics) to formulate astronomical mathematical calculations known as jyotish-gaNita.
