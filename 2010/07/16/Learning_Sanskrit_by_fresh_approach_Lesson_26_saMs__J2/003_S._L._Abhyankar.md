नमो नमः ।  
अपि "रूपञ्चाभरणं मे" (2 + 2 + 2 +1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 12) साधु भवति किल ?  
अनेन "उद्गीति"-वृत्तं सुष्ठु साध्यते खलु ? व्याकरणदोषः अपि न अवशिष्यते ?  

रूपञ्चाभरणं मे भवनं मे साधनानि च मे ।  
इति मे मे कुर्वाणम् कालवृको हन्ति पुरुषाजम् ।।

  

कथमिदम् ?  
सस्नेहम् ,  
अभ्यंकरकुलोत्पन्नः श्रीपादः \|  
"श्रीपतेः पदयुगं स्मरणीयम् ।"
