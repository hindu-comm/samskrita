नमो नमः "जयदीप जोशी"-महोदय !  
Extremely sorry for the problem caused by my using Shusha font, which seemed to have worked well on my computer and also in my text box of gmail.  
However on realizing that many people experienced difficulty in reading that, I have re-written the entire message, using the usual UNICODE font. I sent a revised message just a while ago and have also revised my post at my blog <http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com>  
I have to also revise Lesson 24 ! I shall do it soon.
