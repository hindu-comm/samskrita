namaste,

Sorry, I had intended to send a private reply to Sri Ramakrishna.

This is a tool I had written a while back for my own private use. It  
is beta-quality at best, and is intended for use by those who need  
some specific functionality which is not available from existing  
tooling (e.g. convert unicode back into itrans etc).

Of course, you are all welcome to use it. If you find it useful ... great !

bhavadiiyaH,

ajit
