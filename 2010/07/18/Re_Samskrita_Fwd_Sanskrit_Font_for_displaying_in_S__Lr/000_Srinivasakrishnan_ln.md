Namaste, Abhyankar-ji and everyone else. Here's a different kind of solution:



EPIC, a new Indian web browser has debuted recently.The browser is awesome  
for two reasons:



1\) It has a sidebar which has buttons for many frequently visited sites like  
Gmail, Facebook etc. From the sidebar, you can edit text, read news, view videos  
and pictures and much more. It has a full fledged word processor too.



2\) The browser has a distinct Indian touch - it gives you a notepad to type in  
Indian languages. You type in English and it displays the Hindi, Sanskrit or Tamil script  
which you can then cut paste into your mail. It also has a huge number of Indian  
links already available like NDTV, IBN etc. Of course my grouse is that he has  
hidden 'The HINDU' under Tamilnadu rather than on the button called 'Top  
Stories'. Regardless it's a great beginning.



I've used it all the time since it debuted and it hasn't crashed even once. In addition it has a  
readymade anti virus feature whereby the browser offers in-built protection  
against dangerous sites etc.



The browser is currently available only for Windows and can be downloaded at
