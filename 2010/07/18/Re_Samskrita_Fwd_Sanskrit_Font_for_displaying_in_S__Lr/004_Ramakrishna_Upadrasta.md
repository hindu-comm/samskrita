namaste Shri Srini-ji,

  
2010/7/18 Srinivasakrishnan ln \<[lns2...@gmail.com]()\>:

  
\> Being a Mac User, why do you need external tools for typing in Sanskrit? The

The intent of asking was the following: I still prefer to store ITRANS  
in my files as txt or itx, as this helps in

\(i\) some scripting I do with my mailing lists: which select some text  
from the txt files and sends it to subscribers automatically and

\(ii\) helps search for a word in the text quickly: for example, I make  
use of ITANS encoding in text files to quickly find out -- even in  
texts I know well -- the occurrences of some words (I just found out  
that in gItA, romaharshha is one of the descriptions used by arjuna  
for himself in 1.29 before the teaching, as well as the situation used  
by sanjaya for himself in 18.74 after listening to the teaching).

\(iii\) also, the other machine I use is a linux. Hence the need for  
searching for ITRANS only solution as a means of file transfer between  
the two machines, and "reverse converters".

  
\> Mac supports Sanskrit out of the box.  
\> My God, it's like a resident of Mt Kailas asking for Siva sayujyam :)

You may be right. I should begin my search in my home :)
