All,

The ability to "convert unicode back into itrans etc", has long been  
available with such Itranslator.  
Itranslator 2003 beta works in XP, and Windows 7. And apparently in Vista,  
also.

\> some specific functionality which is not available from existing  
\> tooling (e.g. convert unicode back into itrans etc).
