***I am a foreigner to Hinduism, to the Sanskrit, and I have a very large number of fonts anyway, when I write for another foreigners of this so great culture, I never use Mangal font because seems to be very difficult to many beginners to distinguish clearly some forms of the syllables. What I really use, communicating, is Samskrtam 2003 or Taralabalu and this first because of the Itranslator of Omkarananda Ashram.  
Anyway, you can choose what you want that for me will be fine.
