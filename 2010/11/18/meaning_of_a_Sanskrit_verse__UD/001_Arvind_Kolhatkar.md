As peacocks have plumes and cobras/elephants precious stones (in/on their heads), so is GaNita at the apex of vedaangas and shaastras.

  

(It is a poetic convention in Sanskrit that cobras and elephants in rut have maNi's in their phaTaa or phaNaa (hood) or gaNDashtala (temple).

  

Two corrections are called for in the Sanskrit text. शिखामयूराणां should read शिखा मयूराणां andमणयॉ यथा should be मणयः यथा (with sandhi मणयो यथा).  नाग can mean either 'cobra' or 'elephant'.
