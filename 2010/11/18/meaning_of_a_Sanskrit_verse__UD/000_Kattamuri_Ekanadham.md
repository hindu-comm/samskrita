Could you kindly tell me the meaning of the following verse (specially the pada-chchedam and prati-pada-artham)?

I understand that the summary is to say that the subject of mathematicsis at the pinnacle of all shastras --

but I do not understand the analogy there -- "mayura shikha and naga mani etc.?"

Thanks.
