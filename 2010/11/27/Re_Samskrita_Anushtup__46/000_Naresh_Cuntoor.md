\> Normal form (pathyā)  
\>  
\> Syllables 5-7 of the first pāda must be aya-gaṇa("υ – –")  
\>  
\> Variant forms (vipulā): The 4th syllable of the first pāda is heavy. In

\>  
\> na-vipulā: Syllables 5-7 are ana-gaṇa("υ υ υ")  
\> bha-vipulā: Syllables 2-7 arera-bha gaṇas("– υ – – υ υ") orma-bha  
\> gaṇaswith a caesura in between ("– – – , – υ υ")  
\> ma-vipulā: Syllables 2-7 arera-ma gaṇaswith a caesura after the 5th ("– υ  
\> – – , – –")  
\> ra-vipulā: Syllables 5-7 are ara-gaṇafollowing a caesura (", – υ –")

\> Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first pāda. By

\>\> Dear Group,  
\>\> I do not have any source book to consult here but I remember that the only  
\>\> requirement of अनुष्टुभ् is that there should be four पादs of 8 syllables  
\>\> each. The syllables can be लघु or गुरु arbitrarily. This can be observed  
\>\> from the following two verses ofगीता. I have noted the weights of  
\>\> syllables below eachपाद, writing१ forलघु and२ for गुरु. This ease  
\>\> makes it one of the easiest meters to compose in.
