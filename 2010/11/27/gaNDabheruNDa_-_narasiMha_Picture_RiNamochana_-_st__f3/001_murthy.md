Dear all,

Incidentally gaNDabhEruNDa does not appear to be a Sanskrit word, thoughbheruNDa is listed in aSanskrit dictionary as "a type of bird". This mythical two headed bird is the emblem of Mysore Wadiyar Kings.It was a state emblem of Mysore state too. Could anyone throw more light on the origin of this word and if in any Sanskrit classic it is referred to?

Thanks

Murthy
