Yes, indeed, black pepper was used to spice up food. Please note that  
the word 'curry' comes from a Tamil word 'kaRi'. Today in Tamil this  
word means gravy based non-vege preparation. But in Classical Tamil,  
'kaRi' just meant pepper. (KT Achaya, Foods of India).  
  
Again, buttermilk was commonly used to introduce tartness in the food.  
Tomatoes which are now used for the same purpose was introduced by  
British as late as the 1850's , per Achaya.  
  
As somebody mentioned, none of these ingredients like chillies,  
tomatoes, green beans, toor dal etc can be used when the shraaddham  
meal is cooked.
