Dear Group,

  

A question that has bothered me for long is about Indian Cookery prior to the introduction of chillies into India by the Portuguese, which, they in turn, brought to the Old World from South America. One cannot think of Indian food today without the spicychilliesbut what did the Indians eat before that? ( - Just as what did the Italians eat before tomato came to them.). ( Here it is worthwhile to note that Sanskrit has no word for chillies. The present vernacular Mirch or Mirchi derive from Mariicha or the pepper vine because the closest thing to chillies known to Indians was pepper.)

  

Some answers are available in Arthashaastra or in books on Aayurveda but is there a really good compendium available that speaks of old Indian recipes? If so, is it available online? Old Indian scholarship is almost always about metaphysics or similar intellectual topics but has anyone found time to devote to this mundane subject? I would like to know because that would be a real peep into the life of common people of ancient India.

  

I am sure experts here would have an answer...
