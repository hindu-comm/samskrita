NamastE,  
  
There are other treatises on food like the bhOjana-prabandha and the bhOjana-kutUhala, that have descriptions of fooodstuffs and details of preparatin even.  
  
Besides sanskRt, in other languages like kannaDa and telugu, can be found tomes like sUpa-shAstra; written as recently as 14th century, which have leaborate accounts of foods extant at that time.  
  
Regards,
