Question to all,

When is the earliest that "sabudana" or pearls fromsago / tapioca extract become accepted as a food that can be consumed during "upawaas" or "period of fasting " in India ?

As far as what I know or have read - Sabudana comes from a palm - sago palm which is not native to India (mostly comes from south east asia ), the other option- tapioca is a tuber- native to south america from wher it spread over the world.  

Is this also a Spanish Portuguese gift to the world just like green chillies/pepper , tomato, potato ?
