namaste!

  

black pepper.

  

At home, on days involving rites for fore-fathers, the cooking involved only black pepper - no red chillies, no green chillies. There were other restrictions on what vegetables were allowed and what were not. I assume that what was allowed was from a set of native vegetables and fruits - green beans, carrots, tomatoes, potatoes... were not included.


  

I do not know much more - except a convenient / concocted work-around - if, for a newly dead person, you used an excluded item within the first 13 days of rites, then that 'excluded' item attained 'exemption' and could be included in that person's rites from then on. For us children, food on these days was more contemporary at our maternal relations' households than our paternal counterparts. 'Maternals' were 'city' people and were resourceful about such workarounds. 'Paternals' were from the interiors and not yet (at that time) 'worlldly wise'.

  

This is just my observation. Has not been ratified with anyone in authority / more knowledgeable.

  

Vidya

with praNAms to forefathers on either side :)
