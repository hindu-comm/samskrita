Dear Arvind

There is a text called Ksema-kutuhalam which was recently translated by a Sanskrit scholar named Dr Shankar and published by the FRLHT in Bangalore - see this website page: <http://www.greenhealer.net/index.php?cPath=10_10>

The text is I believe a previously untranslated work on food science and may contain the information you are looking for.

I can put you in touch with Dr Shankar or the institute if you would like.

Best,

Venetia
