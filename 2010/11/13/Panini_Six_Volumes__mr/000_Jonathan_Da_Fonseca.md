***Dear Group Members  
Namaste!  
I deep apologize taking your time with this my request. I had a problem in my computers, Trojan virus, that obliged me to faster format and I did lost a lot. But, all has great results and so I could test my memory - the price of the backups laziness: go for it hahahaha.  
What I am asking is if anyone of the Group is able to concede me the link to download that fantastic volumes of Panini Gammar as for the software to access it.  
Be all deeply Blessed independently, of course, of this my so embarrassing appeal to you.  
Sincerely Yours  
Jonathan Reysh
