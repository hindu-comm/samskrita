Hello,

  

I am looking for a version of the Raja-rajeswhari ashtakam (starts "Amba shambhavi chandramouli-rabala..") sung by Y.N.Sharma and H.A.Shastry. I last heard it many years ago and have lost the cassette. They employ a very unique style of singing, using a raaga which undoubtedly has a strong, 'organic' connection with the poem's metre. Only a very minimal instrumental accompaniment is used (as opposed to versions I've found online, where the composers seem to delight in a cacophony of every instrument they can find and the kitchen sink).

  

I'd be very grateful if someone could provide more information on this. No shop I've tried in Bangalore seems to stock Sharma and Shastry's compositions anymore :-(

  

Thanks,

Mohan
