Upendra,



Your are a mine of information. There is slightly more that one temple in Ellora, and your king would have had to whim along for 500 years. Rock is worked by using fire to heat the surface then shattering it with cold water. Metal was mined this way. Only then do you get your chisels out. You can take a look for yourself right now on Google map for an aerial view.



And again, the Indian and International bodies most certainly are ‘bothered’ with mining the information.



Knowledge is the word here.

I don’t believe that the YS, for example, whose origins derive from the ancients, really speak of super natural powers as is widely reported, but rather of the harnessing the natural powers of the mind. For those that do have then, that is. This today, is what goes by the name of ‘cognitive psychology’, research into which is on going.



With the a, the diaphragm resonates, as the pitch of the sound gently changes to u, the resonation travels to the chest cavity, the mmm resonates on up into the forehead. The attention naturally follows the rhythmic motion and becomes semi-automatic. Breathing and heart rate slows. As the sound reaches up into the forehead there is a growing sense of light therein. With an increase in brightness over time. So much so, that some may seriously be thinking that a car is shining its headlights right at them. You open your eyes, but no car.

Very occasionally, there is a sort of shutting down of ordinary mindfulness. A darkness, a tunnel of light opening out into a great cavern of light. There is an emerging, bodiless, into a great sea of white light. White, not like snow, but clear like air.



A very peaceful, pure consciousness state. I like to think of it as just that, a change of state of consciousness, very much as the change taking place when water goes from liquid to solid as its heat energy level flips the atomic structure. Perhaps a better analogy would be from a liquid to gaseous state. But it must in reality, be the reduction of neural activity in the Brain. An experience very similar to that of the widely reported NDE, currently being seriously studied by an international medical research group.



There must be those that have experienced both these states. They would be able to relate the two.



Knowledge is timeless, whatever its actual origins, it the preserve of all and is not confined to a time capsule.



Didn’t someone say, For I am the teacher, even of the ancients, being unlimited by time. iti.



Eddie
