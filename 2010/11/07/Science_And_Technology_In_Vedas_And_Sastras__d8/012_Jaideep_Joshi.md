I disgree with the sentence "our culture did not nurture the scientific way of enquiry". Yes, the vedas dont give equations, and certainly, modern scientific methods of enquiry are more sophisticated. But then, the purpose of knowledge in the vedas and with modern science is totally different. They start with different axioms, *but both have served their own purpose very well.* modern science seeks to measure and control things, so that one can bring his surroundings under his control, to comfort his life, and it has succeeded very well. vedic science on the other hand, seeks to be unified with the ultimate force (shakti) and conciousness (shiva) that drives the universe.. science describes it as energy, or "laws of physics", vedas describe it as "chitshakti" and "kriyashakti". Vedas have certainly attained what they intended to attain.  
  
I would like to say 2 things as to what use it is to look for science in our ancient texts.  
  
- Firstly, it helps dispell the inferiority complex that Indians have when it comes to science and technology.  
- Secondly, and more importantly, it provides the vision as well as means of technology that is sustainable in the long run. It provides a holistic picture of looking at any system, be it in medicine, agriculture, metallurgy, education or anything. Today, there is a lot of talk on sustainability, holism etc, and compared with the ancient vision, we are merely reinventing the wheel.  
  
I would appreciate more views regarding this from all readers.
