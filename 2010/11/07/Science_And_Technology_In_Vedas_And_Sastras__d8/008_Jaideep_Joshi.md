Namaste,  
  
Before I proceed with this mail, I would like to clarify that I not only believe that the Vedas are vast treasure houses of knowledge, but also am a sincere seeker of that knowledge.  
  
While trying to investigate into this topic, one must be cautious of retrofitting. many-a-times, even the slightest similarity with modern science prompts us to say that the concepts were indeed contained in the Vedas. For example, I have heard people claiming that the rishis knew genetic engineering and relativity by reading mere stories from the mahabharata! Of course, it is possible that they did know, but then, we need more concrete evidence.  
  
Regarding the shloka on the speed of light, it does not appear in the vedas, but in the commentary of Sayana on a particular verse in praise of Sun in Vedas. moreover, the unit conversion is controversial, since the same unit is found to have multiple definitions across the shastras. To confirm that it is indeed the speed of light, one must look at the units prevalent at the time and place of Sayana. Perhaps the Chanakya Arthashastra can give some clue on the unit conversion. Secondly, Vedic mathematics is not contained in Vedas, but was invented by the Shankaracharya of Jagannatha Puri to popularise maths.  
  
All this said, one needs to identify the correct sources of recovering vedic knowledge. Indeed, much can be proved without retrofitting. Here are a few examples:  
  
1) Ayurveda and Yoga systems of well-being  
2) Maths and Astronomy of the Kerala School, Nilakantha Somayyaji, Bhaskaracharya, Aryabhatta etc.  
3) Vedic yagyas like agnihotra, somayag.. I have scientific papers which prove that agnihotra ash is better fertilizer than ordinary ash (but yagyas are not meant for just 1 purpose, but multiple, including peace of mind, air purification, etc)  
4) some 30+ books exist on chemistry, Rasarnava, Rasaratnakara, etc, and the work is very admirable  
5) Vriskhaayurveda etc. tell about a fantastic agricultural system  
6) The Mala, Jata, Ghana pathas of the vedas are shown to be very similar to encoding techniques of modern communication theory by R.L. Kashyap, a Computer Science professor of Purdue University.  
7) Sanskrit language itself is such perfect and most suitable for computer programming  
8) the techniques of making steel, ice, silk, tree cotton, etc.  
9) the various metal alloys described in the Vaimanik Shastra, and the Yantra Sarvasva of Bharadvaj muni can indeed be made today, and are found to have unique properties  
10) Lastly, Advaita Vedanta is saying exactly what physicists say today, (but both the purpose and means are different, so we shud not claim that advaita vedanta = quantum mechanics), and this basically shows the vision of the universe that the Indians had, and perhaps is the seed of the talent, sustainability, tolerance and ecological sensitivity of the Indian culture.  
  
There are many more examples, indeed, 1000s more to be unearthed from various sources. Only 40000 odd manuscripts of ancient texts are preserved in libraries, lakhs more are scattered across in villages of India, unidentified.  
  
Please pardon my arrogant way of writing,  
Pranaams,  
Jaideep
