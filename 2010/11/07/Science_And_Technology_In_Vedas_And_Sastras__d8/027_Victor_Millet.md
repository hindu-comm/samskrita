Namaste,  
  
I would like to thank all the very helpful on- and off-list answers I have recieved to my posting about the identification of Ishopanishat by Swami Bhaskaranand Saraswati. Now we can restore the cover and catalogue the book, although having it so wonderfully online, it will be of only little use.  
  
Best regards  
Victor Millet
