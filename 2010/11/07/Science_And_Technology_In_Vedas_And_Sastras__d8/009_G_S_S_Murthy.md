It is with considerable hesitation that I am putting across my views in this matter.  
I am not sure what we will gain by reading into our ancient scriptures every possible scientific result or achievement. That is not to belittle what our ancients achieved in matters mundane.  
It is my humble submission that although we may be able to read into our scriptures all of scientific results, our culture did not nurture the scientific way of enquiry, which is what matters.
