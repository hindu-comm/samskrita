Dear Neeraj,



May i request you to read Subash Kak's books and articles. Many of his articles areavailable on the web. You may also read with profit the books i mentioned in my previous mail. Yes, Vedas and several sanskrit books have a lot os science and various topics of science, language, mathematics etc were discussed by the ancient Indians. Hence i asked you to start with the books that I mentioned in my previous mail.

Pesonally i feel it is to much to say that ancients knew everthing and they preffred to encrypt all they knew. We must desist the tendncy of Myth making which our ancients many times were so fond off

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
