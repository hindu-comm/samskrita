Namaste,  
  
I have been grossly misunderstood!! This might be turning into a debate, but so be it. That is how we realise mistakes, right? Please bear with this long mail.  
  
I have been stressing the same point that Vimalaji and Murthyji are saying. **The first two paragraphs of my 1st mail are in fact, cautioning against the trap of believing that we knew everything**. But at the same time, I am saying that, in too much suspicion let us not ridicule as retrofitting, even valid scientific discoveries.  
  
**If one claims, just based on stories, that our ancients knew genetic engineering, aeroplanes, relativity, quantum mechanics etc, trash his claims at once!**  
  
But let us not be so skeptical to even overlook what really might have been invented. The 10 things i have listed in my first mail are well proven. I have purposely not included the speed of light, since there is ambiguity of units. I know a few more technologies, but i have not included them because I do not have documentation regarding them.  
  
To the skeptical eye, many things appear to be retrofits, because today, we have better technologies that what our ancients had. But what if we had something more? The list of my 1st mail contain many such examples:  
1) the Indian steel, even though we have the specimens (iron pillar of delhi, etc), we cannot fabricate even today. So there was indeed something in their way of making, which we lack even today. And indeed, among the many missing factors, one has been identified: the rhythmic blowing of air in traditional iron making improves quality as opposed to today's constant speed blowers. This very simple change can be adapted by modern steel industries, and we may get better steel!  
2) After the failure of green revolution, organic farming is assuming importance. Recently, Assam Tea Estate went organic entirely by following the Vrikshayurveda. Yes, we have biotechnology also, but isnt it upto us to understand what path to development is good?  
3) IISc professors have rejected the Vaimanik Shastra saying that its designs are not suitable for plane making. But at the same time, the alloys it describes have indeed been made, and found to have unique properties.  
  
Having said this, I would like to answer the objections of Vimalaji and Narayanji:  
  
@ Vimalaji: No, we need not and should not prove anything to the west. But it is a hard fact that Indians have an inferiority complex in spite of excelling in every field. Perhaps literature is enough to say that we were very brilliant people, but what if we we were even better? Suppose you are a great singer as well as a great painter, how would you feel if I say you are a brilliant painter but a bad singer???  
  
@ Narayanji: Vedas were transmitted by word of mouth, as we all know. But it was believed that even the slightest mistake in recitation renders the mantras ineffective. So now if a student hears a mantra wrongly, and transmits it, there is no way to correct it. In the language of communication theory, encoding basically adds redundancy in the transmitted message so that even if some information is received in error, it can be recovered from other parts of the message. It is more than mere repetition. The mala, jata, ghana pathas of Vedas do precisely that. in fact, each patha encodes for detecting a specific type of error, like missing syllable, jumps to similar sounding words, etc. Had the hymns not been encoded, they could not have been possibly passed by word of mouth for 5 thousand years. And the fact is, the samhitas gathered from various parts of India today differ not more than 1 syllable!!  
**  
Please do continue this topic. It is very important for me. I would really appreciate if you would provide facts either supporting or opposing my points.

Pranaams,
