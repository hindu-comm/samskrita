Dear Group,

  

Upendra says:

  

\<The extremely delicate and priceless silk weaving, and golden thread weaving - "jar" that is worn all over india really possible without the highly developed processes of weaving ?\>

  

I think that silk was not something that Indians knew much about in the Classical period. Such silk as was used came from China. Indians knew of 'kaarpasa' cotton and 'UurNaa' wool but Sanskrit has no word for silk, because Indians of the Classical period did not have their own silk. Reshim or Resham is not Sanskrit.

  

Kaalidaasa knew that silk came from China. In Shaakuntala, DuShyanta going away from KaNva's aashrama but leaving his heart behind, says:

  

gacChati puraH sharIraM dhaavati pashcadasaMsthitaM chetaH \|

cInaaMshukamiva ketoH prativaataM nIyamaanasya \|\|

  

'My body is moving forward but the disturbed mind is trailing behind, like the cInaaMshuka (fine cloth of China) of a flag being carried against the wind.'

  

Secondly, as a craft, weaving is not on par with higher sciences, which is the subject of the present debate. Ancient civilizations all the world over had mastered the craft of weaving, using materials available to them. Therefore mastery of Indians over the craft of weaving does not necessarily translate into other scientific achievements.
