I agree with Murthy Mahodaya. I too have hesitated in replying.

It is often said that the Indians invented and discovered many things before the West – for example, such as aeroplanes, because– rAvaNa had a aerial car. But this only an idea in a story and has very little to do with how modern machines fly. If we say therefore we knew about aeroplanes or missiles before the west, we are exposing ourselves to criticism and possibly even ridicule.

We seem to t be perpetually suffering from an inferiority complex. We don’t have to prove anything to the West. We have a rich store of culture, literature and many philosophical traditions, and possibly the earliest metric literature (Egyptians were before us – but they did not have a substantial corpus of metrical literature) of any culture in the world. Indians to-day work on the forefront of every scientific disciplines and are contributing to new discoveries.
