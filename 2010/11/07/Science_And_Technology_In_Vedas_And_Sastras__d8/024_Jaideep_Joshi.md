Dear all,

  

Since this topic has come up, let us not leave it at this.. let us at least reach some consensus, if not conclusion.

  

To avoid confusion, how about splitting the timeline into Vedic (\< 3000 BC), Ancient (around 300 BC), Middle (1 - 1000 AD), and Recent (1500 - 1800 AD), and listing out the science and technology prevalent/ known in each period? There can also be a discussion on whether a particular technology / knowledge was or was not known, and two things should ultimately emerge out of it:

1\) If it was known, can we derive something from it which does not exist today?

2\) If it was known, can we revive it and practically put it to a good use today?

  

Pranaams,  
Jaideep
