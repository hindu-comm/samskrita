This is in respnse to Mr. Arvind's post.

I understand that there are not many proofs of a developed civilization - e.g. factories found in India, but has India had any government in the past 150 years which is nationalistic ? Has it or its agencies like Archaeological Survey of India , grown beyond highlighting the Taj ?

  

Even though the government hasnt bothered- there are tonnes of proofs to those who seek them.

  

I bet you must strongly believe the myth propagated by british historians that the Verul-(Ellora to some) sculpture - a complete temple carved out of a single rock - was done upon the whim of a king who forced hundreds of stone cutters to build him a temple ?

Do you really believe that this was done by forced labourers who used only hammer and chisels?



There are numerous forts and temples - esp in Southern India where the structure is built about 2000 ft from sea level on the edge of sheer rock cliffs and thogh there is no motorable road, precisely cut and placed blocks of stone have weatherd years of elements and attackers and still stood strong. Was this again a achivement of some ordinary masons ?

  

The extremely delicate and priceless silk weaving, and golden thread weaving - "jar" that is worn all over india really possible without the highly developed processes of weaving ?

  

  

Do you really believe that the vedas and many other scriptures were passed on from one generation to another of rishis and brahmins for over 3000 years despite many years of persecution ,just for the sake of improving one's memory and develoiping a good ability to sing?

  

We need to open our hearts to the possibilities and try to merge modern knowhow with the sanskrit leterature to see what we can decipher out of it.
