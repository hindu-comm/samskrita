sorry correction:

read NOT for NIT

the sutra 1,2.032 translates as

its (svarit's) first (part is ) udatta half short

svarit is pronounced for a period of 2 matraas.

a long vowel equals 2 matraas.

a shortvowelor a consonant ending with a short vowel is pronounced with one mattra.

a consonant with no vowel is half a matra.

so the two matraas of a swarit are divided as first half a matraa as udatta.

the remaining one and a matraa as anudaatta.

auddhav
