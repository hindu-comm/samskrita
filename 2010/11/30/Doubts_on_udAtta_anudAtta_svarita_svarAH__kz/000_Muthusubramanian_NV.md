सर्वेभ्यो नमस्काराः  
  
I am new to this group and would like some one to help me on these. I hope this is the right forum to discuss such stuff.  
  
I have been having doubts over the definitions of उदात्त अनुदात्त स्वरित स्वराः.  
  
पाणिनि has described these as उच्चैरुदात्तः, नीचैरनुदात्तः and समाहारः स्वरितः. What I have understood is that उदात्त is told from the upper part, अनुदात्त is told from the lower part of each स्थान (कण्ठ, तालु, so on). and स्वरित is half उदात्त and half अनुदात्त.  
  
In Vedashlokas, अनुदात्त is told at a lower pitch, स्वरित is told at a higher pitch and उदात्त is the normal pitch. Telling a स्वर from the higher part of a स्थान (उदात्तस्वर) would actually increase the pitch. Doesn't that mean that by Panini's definitoin उदात्त is of the higher pitch, अनुदात्त the lower pitch and स्वरित the normal pitch?  
  
Can some one clarify on these aspects?
