**Part 4 - Consonants क् to ङ्**

Just as vowels have the place of origin - throat अ आ teeth, इ ई lips उ ऊ roof ऋ (ऋ - long) and gums, लृ; the consonants are most certainly grouped by the place of their origin.  
Their are five prominent groups of five consonants each.  
The first group is of consonants emanating from the throat, called as kaNThya (कण्ठ्य) - क् ख् ग् घ् ङ्  
This group is also called as "ka-varga" क-वर्ग  
  
It should be noted that all consonants are written with a small slash below the letter. This is because without the slash is the pronunciation when the vowel sound mixes into the basic consonant sound. For example क् + अ = क The basic consonant sounds are hence written with the slash. All of the fourteen शिवसूत्राणिend with a consonant sound !  
  
क् is written in transliteration by using "k" and is the sound  

-   of "c" in "act" -   of "k" in "kite" -   of "ch" in "character" -   of "ck" in "cock"  

ख् is written in transliteration by using "kh" and is the sound  

-   of "kh" in the Indian word "khel" -   Is there an English word with this sound ?  

ग् is written in transliteration by using "g" and is the sound  

-   of "g" in "go"  

घ् is written in transliteration by using "gh" and is the sound  

-   of "gh" in "ghetto" -   In many English words "gh" becomes silent in pronunciation ! e.g.
    Burroughs  

ङ् is written in transliteration by using "\~g" (in BARAHA) and is the sound  

"n" in "bang", "bank"  

This consonant is the nasal sound happening, when the nasal sound is followed by any other consonant of this group. For example -

-   अङ्क, सङ्ख्या, अङ्ग, जङ्घा,  
-   The nasal sound can be also written by a dot above the previous
    letter e.g. अंक संख्या अंग संघ   

Out of the five consonants the first two क् ख् are rather harsh "kaThora" कठोर  
The next two ग् घ् are soft "mRudu" मृदु  
The last one ङ् is nasal "anunaasika" अनुनासिक  
There again, the second and fourth ख् and घ् have a sound of "h" contained in them and hence need that much more force to pronounce them. Hence they are called as mahaapraaNa महाप्राण  
The first and third क् and ग् do not need as much force. So, they are called as alpapraaNa अल्पप्राण  
Thus five consonants in each group are in the sequence -  
(१) कठोर अल्पप्राण क् (२) कठोर महाप्राण ख् (३) मृदु अल्पप्राण ग् (५) मृदु महाप्राण घ् (५) अनुनासिक ङ्  
  
This sets the pattern for learning consonants of five groups.
