Dear Hemanth Kumar,

It was with deepest sorrow that we read the mail sent by one of our members Shri Sunder Hattangadi.



Please accept our heartfelt condolences to you and your family, and we pray to the almighty to give you all the strength to bear this irreparable loss.



We used to lookforward to the mails by your father. We pray that your work will remind us of him, always.



May his soul rest in peace.



Regards

Krishnanand Mankikar.
