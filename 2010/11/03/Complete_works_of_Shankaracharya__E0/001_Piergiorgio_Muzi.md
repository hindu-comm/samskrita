Dear Mr Ramesh Mahodaya,

thanks very much for the useful information.May I ask you for some more? I am reading and translating Upadeçasâhasrî. In the site reported by you there is only the first chapter of the prose part of the work. Do you know whether there is a web site with the other sections (i.e. the following two prose chapters and the whole metrical part)?

Warm regards,

Piergiorgio
