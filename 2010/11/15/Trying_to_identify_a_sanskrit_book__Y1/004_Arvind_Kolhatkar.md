Dear Dr. Millet,

  

\<1901. Ishopanishat Swami Bhaskaranand Saraswati Ji; RELIGION. THEOLOGY, 2006, Ambica charan Bandopadhya of Agarpara District 24 Perannah, 501 pages. Barcode 1990030083621 Scan available.

  
It could be this book we are trying to catalogue, because it is the only one byAmbica Charan Bandopadhya.We have downloaded several times the DLI Downloader 0.2 and tried to download a scan of this book in order to check if it is the one we have, but the connection fails or the programme does not work on our computer (Windows 7).>

  

I have been able to downloadfrom the DLI Bangalore sitethe first 15 pages of the book that you mention. I am new to this group and am not sure if attachments are allowed to mails sent to this group. Some other groups that I know do not allow attachments.

  

I am attaching those 15 pages in a separate mail to[victor...@usc.es](). 

  

I too use Windows 7 but this time had no difficulty in downloading the book after I located it. I have not been so lucky on other occasions.
The Gods who run DLI are capricious!

PS. By God!. Google is really marvellous!

  

After I had sent my personal mail to you and while composing this one afterwards, I noticed the link 'Attach a file'. That settles my doubt and attachments are allowed. When I pressed the 'Send' button, Google asked me whether I wish to attach anything to this mail as the text contains the phrase 'I am attaching'. Is it benevolent paternalism or the Big Brother Watching?
