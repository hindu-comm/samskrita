@Victor:

  

I have downloaded the first 10 pages of this book using a more stable custom DLI command-line downloader that I wrote myself (for downloads I prefer command-line rather than GUI based applications). I am attaching the file. If this group does not allow attachments and you did not get the attachment I will send it separately to you.

  

FYI, the book does not have a cover page, it starts with preface directly, though there is a picture of Sri Bhaskaranand Saraswati.
