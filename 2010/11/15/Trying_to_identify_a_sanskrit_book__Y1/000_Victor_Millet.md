Dear Sirs,  
  
we are cataloguing the library of a former professor of european medieval literature who had also a small collection of oriental texts. Among these, there is a book which has lost its cover, so we cannot identifiy it. It is written in Sanskrit and contains several Upanishads (Isa, Kena, Katha, Prasna, Mundaka, Mandukya aso.). The short prologue in English is signed by Ambica Charan Bandopadhya of √Ågarpara.  
  
Now we have searched in the database of [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) and found a book under number 1901:  
  
1901. Ishopanishat Swami Bhaskaranand Saraswati Ji; RELIGION. THEOLOGY, 2006, Ambica charan Bandopadhya of Agarpara District 24 Perannah, 501 pages. Barcode 1990030083621 Scan available.  
  
It could be this book we are trying to catalogue, because it is the only one by Ambica Charan Bandopadhya. We have downloaded several times the DLI Downloader 0.2 and tried to download a scan of this book in order to check if it is the one we have, but the connection fails or the programme does not work on our computer (Windows 7).  
  
We thought that perhaps someone on this mailing list could send us a scan at least of the first 10 pages so that we can identify the book, catalogue it for our library and even restore the cover.  
  
We would be very grateful for any help you could give us.  
Sincerely yours
