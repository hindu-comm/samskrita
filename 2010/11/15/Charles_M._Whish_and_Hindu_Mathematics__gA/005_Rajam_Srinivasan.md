Dear Shri Kolhatkar;  
  
Greetings! Yes! I did receive the attachments and Iam truly grateful for the same. Also please forgive me for not acknowledgingyour generous gift. Unfortunately Ididn't realize I was the only recipient and had assumed it was available to the whole group:(  
  
I teach math, statistics, earth science and biology in a private college. I also teach math and science in Hindu Temples and their youth clubs in New York. These article/sI received by you are truly a wonderful gift for all of us -- the students and the teacher:) This is the season of "Thanksgiving" -- a festival celebrated by Americans!So I feel we have a wonderful reason to give thanks! Thanks!  
  
With regards,  
  
A. Iyengar
