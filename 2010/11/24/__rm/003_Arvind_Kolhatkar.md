Dear Group,

  

After writing the above I found the following in Wikipedia at<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADubh>

  

\<In classical Sanskrit the anuṣṭubh developed into its specific epic form known as[shloka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shloka "Shloka"), as described above, which may be considered the Indian verse*par excellence*, occurring, as it does, far more frequently than any other meter in classical Sanskrit poetry.^([\[3\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADubh#cite_note-2))

The epic anuṣṭubh ([shloka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shloka "Shloka")) is treated as a couplet. Each[hemistich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemistich "Hemistich")of 16 syllables can take either a**pathyā**("normal") form or one of several**vipulā**("extended") forms.

The metrical constraints on a hemistich in terms of its two constituent pādas are as follows:^([\[4\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADubh#cite_note-3))

-   General

1.  The 1st and 8th syllables of both pādas are anceps. 2.  The 2nd and 3rd syllables cannot both be light (laghu, "**υ**") in
    either pāda; i.e. one or both of the 2nd and 3rd syllables must be
    heavy (guru, "**–**") in both pādas. 3.  Syllables 2-4 of the second pāda cannot be
    a[ra-gaṇa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")(the
    pattern "**– υ –**") 4.  Syllables 5-7 of the second pāda must be
    a[ja-gaṇa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")("**υ
    – υ**") This enforces an iambic cadence.

-   Normal form (pathyā)

1.  Syllables 5-7 of the first pāda must be
    a[ya-gaṇa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")("**υ
    – –**")

-   Variant forms (vipulā): The 4th syllable of the first pāda is heavy.
    In addition, one of the following is permitted:

1.  **na-vipulā**: Syllables 5-7 are
    a[na-gaṇa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")("**υ
    υ υ**") 2.  **bha-vipulā**: Syllables 2-7 are[ra-bha
    gaṇas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")("**–
    υ – – υ υ**") or[ma-bha
    gaṇas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")with
    a caesura in between ("**– – – , – υ υ**") 3.  **ma-vipulā**: Syllables 2-7 are[ra-ma
    gaṇas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")with
    a caesura after the 5th ("**– υ – – , – –**") 4.  **ra-vipulā**: Syllables 5-7 are
    a[ra-gaṇa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")following
    a caesura ("**, – υ –**")

Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first pāda. By comparison, Syllables 5-7 of any pāda in the old Vedic anuṣṭubh is typically a[ja-gaṇa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87a_(prosody) "Gaṇa (prosody)")("**υ – υ**"), or a dijambus.>
