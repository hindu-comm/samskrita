One of our students had this interesting question about colors in Samskrita. Has there been any scientific treatise (shastra) regarding colors, like in chemistry (rasAyana shastra) ?

  

Also can any one throw light on etymology of the words of color in Samskrita ?

  

Sveta

Krishna

rakta

pIta

harita

nIla

pATala
