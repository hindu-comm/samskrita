It seems Sanskrit words for different colours are also derived from the context where they are commonly seen.  
  
e.g. लोह लोहित ताम्र हरिततृण सुवर्ण रौप्य नीलाम्बर पीताम्बर अरुण (is the color of sun at dawn अरुणोदय) मेघः-श्याम चन्द्रकान्त  
गाङ्गमम्बु सितमम्बु connotes that water of Ganges is clearer in color than water of यमुना which must have been rather brackish. By that यमुन also connotes brackish color.  
  
श्वेत शुभ्र धवल may all connote white; but, maybe, शुभ्र connotes transparency which is color-less !  
It would be interesting to see what अमरकोश says on this.
