Hi, dear friends, there must be a lot of nouns / adjectivesfor colours in Sanskrit. Only few of them are clearly connected with correspondent terms in other I.E. languages. I have checkedsome dictionaries to compare the meaning; very often they are uncertain and sometimes inconsistent; BTW, in Old Greek the same word was used for yellow and green: chloros, from which chlorophyll.

As for RED:

रुधिर (Lat. ruber, Greek, erythros and Goth rauth...)

लोह लोहित (same root, since here luh is equivalent to rudh, very probably)

अरुण

As for YELLOW:

हरि हरित् हरित

गौर (does it refer to the colour of a kind of buffalo?)

As for WHITE:

शुक्ल शुभ्र शुचि

सित(possibly connected withअसित= black, considered wrongly a negative from)

धौत धवल (both from dhâv , to wash)

अर्जुन (Gr argos and Lat argentum, etc.)

पाण्डु (whitish? yellowish?)

As for BLACK:

काल

श्याम (is it black or blue?)

As for BROWN:

कपिश पिशङ्ग पिङ्गल कपिल (???)

It is a subject rich of psycholinguistic issues and connected with the general problem of translation and linguistic relativity.

Thanks, regards,

Piergiorgio
