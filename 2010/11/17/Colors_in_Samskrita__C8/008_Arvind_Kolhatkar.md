Dear Group,

  

While talking of the colorलोहित the following verse came to mind but try as I might, I cannot get the missing words! Can someone supply them? Thanks for the help.

  

कस्त्वं लोहितलोचनास्यचरणो हंसः कुतो मानसात्।

किं तत्रास्ति सुवर्णपङ्कजवनान्यम्भः सुधासंनिभम्।

.......................................वैडूर्यरोहाः क्वचित्।

शम्बूकाः किमुसन्ति नेति च बकैराकर्ण्य हीहीकृतम्॥
