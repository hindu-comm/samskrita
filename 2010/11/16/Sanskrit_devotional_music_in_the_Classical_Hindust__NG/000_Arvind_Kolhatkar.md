Dear Group,

  

Several Sanskrit devotional pieces rendered in the Classical Hindustani style by Pandit Jasraj are available in the internet in sites like youtube. My favorite is the 53-minute concert at<http://www.rajshri.com/Video/Maestros-In-Concert-Pandit-Jasraj-Live-at-India-Gate>.

  

Panditji has rendered three pieces here and the words of the first two, starting with व्रजे वसन्तं नवनीतचोरम् and या देवी सर्वभूतेषु मातृरूपेणसंस्थिता, are clear to me. I cannot make out some of the words of the third drut composition that starts with the word
चन्द्रघण्टा.

  

Could an interested member of the Group explain them?
