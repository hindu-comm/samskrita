Dear Group,

  

May I suggest that we create this thread to pool our resources and bring together 'orphan' or anonymous verses that display some clever manipulation of the language? There already are collections of such verses - for example, the mahakavyas have chapters devoted to them. Not much will be gained by repeating them It is the 'orphan' verses that need to be brought together as an online resource as a ready reference for anyone who may be interested in them.

  

I shall make a modest beginning by contributing this:

  

विषं भुङ्क्ष्व महाराज स्वजनैः परिवारितः।

नाभ्यांकेन विना राजन् कृष्णाजिनमकण्टकम्॥

  

'Great King, Take poison, accompanied by your dear ones. Also eat a deer-hide without its navel and thigh, after removing thorns.' This is the literal meaning.

  

Now look at the meaning by rearranging the words as under:

  

महाराज स्वजनैः परिवारितः (त्वं) वि-षं विना नाभ्यां केन (च) कृष्णाजिनं अकण्टकं भुङ्क्ष्व।

  

If you take away ष्, the two nasalsन् and ण् andक् from कृष्णाजिनं you are left withऋआजिअ, which, by the rules of sandhi, isराज्यं. Now the verse makes sense!

  

(Had the terms been coined in those days, this verse would have qualified as a PJ or a sick joke in Sanskrit!)

  

If an perceived anonymous verse has an author known to a member, that too is useful info and worth recording.
