there seems to be shlESa traversing two languages here - most likely
this verse was composed in response to a challenge in an aSTAvadhAna



The first word of each verse is a name of a relationship in kannada, and the poem must be intelligible to an avadhAni who has both kannada and sanskRta.



attigE -bhrAtRjAya - sister-in-law

tangi - sister - svasR

tamma = brother - anuja (**tangItamma**-nasA)

bhAva - sister's husband (jIjA in hindi)

nAdini = nanAndA - sister-in-law  

atti = khAdati

It probably should be manasA hasan



bisa = lotus  

Regards,
