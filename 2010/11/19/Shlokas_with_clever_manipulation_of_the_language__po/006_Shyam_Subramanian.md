Dear Sri Abhyankar,  
  
I have a question that is about your above question, though not directly related to the sloka. Is there any rule in saMskRta about how  
it should be written? I understand that it is convenient for comprehension to write each padam separately, but I guess that is also  
usually violated under sandhi (e.g. vRddhirAdaic is hardly written as vRddhir Adaic). I am curious to know if there are strict rules about writing  
saMskRta, especially given the oral nature of transmission of many things in our tradition.  
  
Regards,  
Shyam
