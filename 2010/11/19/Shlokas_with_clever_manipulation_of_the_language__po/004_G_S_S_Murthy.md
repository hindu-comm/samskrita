I offer this sloka for what it is worth. I learnt it from my uncle. I do not know if he himself had created it or learnt it from some one else.He did not tell me what it meant. Anyone who knows Kannada can recognise that in it there are words which sound like Kannada.

atti geheLi samtoShaM

tam gItammanasaahasam\|

bhaavakeLimanollaasam

naadinI bisanIra taa\|\|

अत्ति गेहेलि सम्तोषम्

तम् गीतम् मनसा हसम्।

भाव केलि मनोल्लासम्

नादिनी बिस नीर ता॥

It is also possible that it does not have any meaning.
