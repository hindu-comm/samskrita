Interesting !  
(1) मनसा हसम् can also be written as मनसाहसम् ?  

-   मनसा हसम् = smiling more internally than loudly -   मनसाहसम् = boldness in the mind !

\(2\) बिस नीर = "hot water" in Kannada ?  
(3) अत्ति seems to be Pali or Ardhamagadhee for अत्र  
(4) गेहेलि seems to be mixture of गेह = house (Sanskrit) + ili इलि = "here" in Kannada  
(5) On the whole अत्ति गेहेलि सम्तोषम् = "Happy in this house here" Am I guessing too much ?  
(6) In बिस नीर ता is it possible that  

-   बिस sounds to be PrakRut of विष typically in the style of व्रजभाषा
    and  
-   बिस नीर ता could be विषनीरता = having qualities of poisoned water ? -   नीर is certainly pure Sanskrit, apart from being Kannada and many
    Indian languages having adapted this word as their own. नीर= water
    is very common in Kannada  

The verse may not be meaningless but seems to be composed by curious mixture of many languages !
