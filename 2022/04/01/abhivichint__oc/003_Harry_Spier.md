Thank you everyone,

I'm aware of the dictionary definitions ofविचिन्त् and अभिचिन्त् and as far as I can see, they have similar meanings. What I was really trying to find out is ifअभिविचिन्त् has some subtly different meaning.
What surprised me is that it isn't in Monier-William's dictionary.This is the first time I've found a word in the Nala story that Monier-Williams hasn't included in his dictionary. I've also done a search of the GRETIL on-line texts (which is a large collection of the sanskrit literature from all periods) and this one usage in the Nala story is the only place in the GRETIL on-line texts it appears.

Thanks again,

Harry Spier
