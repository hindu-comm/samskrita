\*Sanskrit movie for Sanskrit Lovers\*

  

After 40 years a full fledged Sanskrit movie titled ‘Ekachakram’ was premiered at Suchitra film institute last Sunday. The movie was directed by the renowned director K Suchendra Prasad. The movie is based on the Sanskrit kavya ‘Ekachakram’ by Mahamahopadhyaya Late NadahaLLi Ranganath’s Sharma, a renowned grammarian, Philosopher and Scholar. The story is based on the historic epic Mahabharata from the episode of Pandava’s exile in the village Ekachakram. It is very important to support such movies especially when Sanskrit is being pushed to the margins and being projected as a dead language.

  

Please share with family, friends, Sanskrit and movie lovers and support the movie. You can watch the trailer here. Watch out for the official release.
