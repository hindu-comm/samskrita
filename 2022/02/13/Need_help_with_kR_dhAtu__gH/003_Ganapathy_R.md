Thank you Saroja Bhagini. 3.4.115 says लिट् च and not लृट् च. Therefore this sutra doesn't help in solving my problem.

  

My question is when कृ धातु is stated to be अनिट्, then why it takes इडागम in लृट् लकार? Which is the relevant sutra for this?

  

As regards the sutra 6.4.16 it says that अजन्त अङ्ग will take दीर्घ when सन् follows. Now for कृ धातु+ सन्, I can derive upto चि कृ + स. The next step should be चि कर् (1.1.51) and if इडागम is to be added then the अङ्ग will be चि करि. Now by application of 6.4.16 it would become चि करी+ ष (स will become ष when it follows इडागम). So the form will be चिकरीष and not चिकीर्ष. I know I am missing some steps but thesolution still eludes me. Can you please help further.

  

Thanks and Om

  

Ganapathy
