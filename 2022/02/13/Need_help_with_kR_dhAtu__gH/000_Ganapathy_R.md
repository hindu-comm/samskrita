I need help on 2 issues with कृ धातु on the basis of the conjugations shown in [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com).

  

कृ धातु is listed both in 5th गण and 8th गण. Both are अनिट्. However, when I went through the conjugations for लृट् लकार, the form for the is given as करिष्यति for both गणs suggesting that the धातु is सेट्. Please help to understand whether the इडागम used is a mistake.

  

Secondly, the सनन्त form is चिकीर्षति. I am unable to find the sutra for the use of ई after क्.

  

Can someone help on these two issues please.

  

Thanks and Om

  

Ganapathy
