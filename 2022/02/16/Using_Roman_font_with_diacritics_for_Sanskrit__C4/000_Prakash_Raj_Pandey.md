Pranam to all Vidvans

  

These days I use Unicode font -- Siddhanta -- to type in Devanagari.  
  
I have never used Roman font with diacritics,Now I want to give it a try, 

  
Is there a short-cut method to type a character having diacritical mark or I have to access -- character map-- copy and paste the character in my writing each and every time I need to one.  
  
Regards,  
Prakash Raj Pandey
