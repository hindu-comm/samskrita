Namaskaram,

If you do come to find out about this, can you kindly tell me the same as well?

Also, I think you could ask Mira T Sundara Rajan about this, she is his own great granddaughter and her mother was a Bharati Scholar. Her contacts details are publicly available via a Google Search

Bharati was very fluent in Sanskrit, so maybe he did some translations herself.

  

Regards,

Krishna Nair
