Raghavan ji,

You may try this tool and attached to your browser to translate English to Indic languages anywhere on the web. I don't See Sanskrit in the list. One may request to Google's Indian CEO. I read all YouTube video comments written in various languages in English.

  

Click all the icons to practice.

Regional Language Reader

<https://readmylanguage.com/readmylanguage/regional_reader.php>  

  

These two tools if used on all Indian websites will save any Indic
language from imposition.

India needs to provide Equal education via translation and transliteration to all.
