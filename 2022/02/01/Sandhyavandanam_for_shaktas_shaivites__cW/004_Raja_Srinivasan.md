This is the South Indian Iyengar version demo videos.

Through the grace of Sri Gopala Mahadesikan, the former head of Poundrikapuram Andavan Ashram, I got the demo videos of Yajur Veda Sandhyavandhanam. The procedure is similar for everyone — only the sankalpa mantras would change from “SrimanNarayana Prithyartham” to “SriParameshvara Prithyartham”. Anyone can download it from my Sharepoint Drive. Please forward to interested people.

I did not get the Rg Veda and Sama Veda versions — they are slightly different. I will approach the ashram and see if I can get those videos also and will share.
