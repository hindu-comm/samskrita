In addition to the input tool Mohan Chettoor pointed out, you will need to install a unicode font on your computer that include the characters of the "vedic extensions block". I don't know the Bharaha software or if it includes this. For devanagari for Word documents the free Adhishila and Adhishila San fonts from <https://adishila.com/fonts/> can be used.
