Dear Ramesh ji,

  

Thanks for the correction. Yes point D is 2400 Marjana with Gayatri Mantra

  

Dear Shekar ji,

  

As per shastras Purascharana should not be done with an aim to get siddhi. The more we think of that I should get Siddhi and want to use my powers the more you will be far from getting any siddhi. Its like greed doesn't give you phalam in the long run. Also the word "Purascharana" means preparatory or introductory rite .

  

If you want to know different types of Siddhis for knowledge sake, do a google search and there are lot of things mentioned

  

Om
