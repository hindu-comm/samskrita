Namaste,

  

Shastras mention "Na GayatryaParo Mantraha". There is no mantra which is above Gayatri mantra as it is the supreme. Below is the procedure for Gayatri Purascharana Siddhi

  

A. 24,00,000 Japas of Gayatri Mantra

B. 2,40,000 Ahutis in Homa Agni with Gayatri Mantra

C. 24,000 Tarpanas with Gayatri Mantra

D. 24,000 Marjana with Gayatri Mantra

E. 240 Brahmana Bhojana

  

All the above following strict Niyama of 3 times pooja of Gayatri each day till this full procedure is over, no outside food (self cooked better), sleeping on floor for entire duration, brahmacharya etc.

  

Hope this gives some insight that Purascharana is not an easy task as it require extreme control over mind and body to achieve the siddhi.

  

Om
