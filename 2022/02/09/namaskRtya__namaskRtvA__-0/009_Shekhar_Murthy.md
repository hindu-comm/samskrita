Dear Respected Learned Members,

  

I have come across words “ purascarna siddhi “ पुरश्चरण सिद्धि:”, that one can achieve by chanting some Vēda mantra , for example, for some specified number of days ,following certain conditions, will get purascharana siddhi

  

Request learned members to clarify on thismatter

  

Best Regards

Shekhar Murthy
