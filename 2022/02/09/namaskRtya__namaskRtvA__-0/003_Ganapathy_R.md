I think the point raised by Chitra Bhagini is that both usages are found नमस्कृत्वा and नमस्कृत्य. The former isक्त्वा प्रत्यय and the latter is ल्यप्. As per my understandingल्यप् is used whenthe धातु has an उपसर्ग. But inनमस्कृत्य there does not appear to be anyउपसर्ग But the usage is seen in the shloka which has been quoted. Therefore, this could be छान्दसप्रयोग. Therefore, both are साधु.

  

Thanks and Om
