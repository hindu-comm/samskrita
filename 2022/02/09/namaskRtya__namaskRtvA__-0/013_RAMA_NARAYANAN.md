Dear divine souls!

  

    Pranams. The mantras are classified as upasana mantra and prayoga mantra.

  

Upasana mantra is the moola mantra of any deity where the receiter seeks everything (dharma, artha, kaama and moksha) from the upasana moorthy.

  

In case of prayoga mantra, the upasana moorthy is not constant. it is varying depending upon the need of the sadhaka.

  

Now, comes the mantra siddhi.

First, you should understand what is mantra?

Ans: manaathu trayate ithi mantra:.

I.e. receiting thorough your mind is called mantra.

General rule for siddhi is, receit the mantra 1 lac times for each letter. (Akshara laksham)

E.g.:if you want to do siddhi of gayatri mantra,

1lac times for each letter means, gayatri mantra is 24 letters hence 24 lacs times you have to receit.

For nama: shivaya, it is 5lac times receitation required.

Then, 1/10th is homa aahuthi (i.e. offerings submitted to the mantra deity via agni)

Then, 1/100th is tarpana (ie propitiate the deity with water)

Then, 1/1000th is marjana (ie: invoke the deity's blessings to our soul)

Tnen, 1/10000th persons for bojana. This is the process where you abolish your ego.

  

The whole process is purascharana.

  

Now, the question comes, after doing all these proceedures, is there any gurantee for mantra siddhi?

  

The answer is "NO".

  

Then why do we do?

Basically, our mind should be very pure (ie no deviation)

You should have the avid urge towards the mantra siddhi, just like, in the absence of air, you cannot live without that.

  

If you can control your mind, the siddhi is very much possible.

  

Now, what are the steps the sadhaga should take?

Ans:

1\. Niyama:- diciplanise your daily activities.

2\. Iyama:- concentrate on the activities without distractions.

3\. Asana-practise relevant excercises to control mind.

4\. Pranayama:- control your breath.

5\. Pratyahara:-hold the body with or without breath.

6\. Dharana-This is the time, you start receiting the mantra.

7\. Dhyana-you dissolve yourself in the mantra's sound.

8\. Samathi-this is the time, the mantras showing its power. There is no difference between sadhaga and deity and mantra. All become one.

You and you only experience the mantra siddhi. But, wrong usage or for demo purposes don't use. If used, it will vanish.

  

Hope, you will get a out line of mantra siddhi.

  

Seva mem samarpith,

Rama narayanan.
