Dear Sri GSS Murthy,  
  

Namaste!  
  

A Sanskrit equivalent for the word 'average' is already available in the 'ENGLISH - SANSKRIT' DICTIONARY edited by Shastri & Pandey and published by Neeta Prakashan, New Delhi. That was given as 'मध्यमानः' which is a Masculine word. This is for your kind information please.  
  

Sincerely,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
