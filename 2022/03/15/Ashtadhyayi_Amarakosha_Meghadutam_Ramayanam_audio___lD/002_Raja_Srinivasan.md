I went through this in greater detail this morning. A wonderful site and hats off to the people behind this. I love the way this web page is setup. One request -- can we add Srimad Bhagavatam to this site?

  

Although I could not view Srimad Ramayana text via the link on the main page, I was able to follow along with the menu links on the left of the page. Wonderful!!!
