Swamin:

Malola Kannan’s recording of Swamy Vedanta Desika’s Paduka Sahasram is available on YouTube and it is available under creative common license. . The YouTube is missing the verses. (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoKYBaCNvAo&list=PLiKDbzPU2OlE7ZaJD7M4cRaRp3n6MsSDG>). It would be a great service to add Swamy Vedanta Desika’s Paduka Sahasram to this list.

  

Regards

Raja
