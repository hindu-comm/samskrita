Namaste,  
  
Arsha Seva Kendram (<https://arshasevakendram.org/>), a non-profit organization founded to impart the teaching and attitude of Seva as given to us by our Rishis, is pleased to announce Samskrutam courses starting at the end of March, 2022. The primary purpose of Arsha Seva Kendram is to teach Vedanta and Sanskrutam, both being at the core of what is commonly called “Indian Culture”.  
  
After having successfully taught several students over the last 3 years, ASK is about to begin a new set of classes. Although teaching for the Samskrita Bharati Distance Learning Program Exams (Pravesha, Parichaya, Shiksha and Kovida) is not the primary goal of these courses, they will be guided in broad terms by them. Emphasis will be on learning the concepts, sambhaashaNa, written skills in Samskrutam and classroom participation of all students. Concepts will be instilled firmly with the help of regular weekly homeworks similar to what one finds in a college/university environment. All courses are taught by experienced Samskrutam teachers.  
  
**COURSE BEGINS**: Last week of March, 2022  
**COURSEENDS**: January 2023  
**FEES**: Free; a token dakshina (Rs.101/USD 25) will be asked at the time of registration  
**TEACHING METHOD**: Online, via Zoom  
  
**LAST DATE TO REGISTER**: March 20, 2022  
  
Please see the attached poster for deciding your current skill level and register for the  
appropriate course.  
  
We hope you take advantage of this great program and start/continue on your journey of learning Samskrutam.  
  
DhanyavaadaH,  
BhanuH
