Srinivisan Ji,

Namaste,  

This verse is a composition of Dr. Madhav Deshpande. Also, as you rightly said, it appears in a larger collection of verses on Shri Krishna composed by Deshpande Sir. I have seen a few of his verses that he posted a while ago on Shri Krishna. His verses are quite heartfelt.

  

Best wishes,

Paras Mehta
