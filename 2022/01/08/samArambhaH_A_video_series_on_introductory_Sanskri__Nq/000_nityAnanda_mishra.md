I am pleased to inform everybody that I have started a video series on introductory Sanskrit for beginners and new learners. To start with, twenty-five videos are planned on the *Kathākusuma*of Paṇḍita Ambikādatta Vyāsa (1858-1900). Each video will have the narration, Hindi explanation, English explanation, and a simple Sanskrit translation (with occasional citations from the *Amarakoṣa* and the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*) of one short story of the*Kathākusuma*and end with the laudatory verse composed by by Paṇḍita Maheśaśarmā Jhā.

  

The first video in the series was published today
