Dear Mr.Miśraji,

  

Thank you very much for taking the time and energy in starting off this initiative. I found it very helpful; the narration was clear and the explanation reiterated in Hindi, English and then Samskritamfurther clarified.

  

Much appreciated. Hari OM!

  

May many more of these flower..

  

Sunil
