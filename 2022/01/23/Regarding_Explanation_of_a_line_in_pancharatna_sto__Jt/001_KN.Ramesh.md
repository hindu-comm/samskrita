Thinking that objects of enjoyment such as a garland of flowers, sandal and women as giving (permanent) happiness you amuse yourself in them. They are like the Ketaki flowers, causing grief after enjoyment. O mind-bee! you wander in vain in the worthless desert of mundane existence. Resort again and again to the honey of the pure lotus-feet of (lord) Lakshminarasimha....

Acharyal quotes it along with garland of flowers, sandal & women.... which cause displeasure after enjoying them.. ( ie., they cant give happiness forever). It is a literal meaning. Deeper meaning is that one cannot derive eternal /permanent happiness from them as they will vanish like**गन्धफलीसदृशा - ie., like the fragrance ( which does not last forever)**

Probably some one has equatedगन्धफलीसदृशा with campaka / ketaki flower which loses its fragrance on smelling ..

IMHO, the best flower to be equated for this will be anicham poo ..

In tamil there is a flower called anicham poo also called as Sirisham poo.. (Girls are named Sirishaa )which is very soft.  

This flower will shrink once you smell it. It is so soft that it can only handle a bee sitting on it...

Kalidasa, Thiruvalluvar have used this as a similey at many places
