I seek the help of learned scholars in this group.

  

There is a dhatu

षस्जँ गतौ

which becomes सज्ज् by application of sutra

धात्वादेः षः सः (6.1.64). Is the application of this sutra negated if the dhatu is preceded by an upasarga. If so, I would like to know the relevant sutra.

  

Please help.

  

Thanks and regards,

Ganapathy
