Imre Bangh gets it partly right.

  

Hindi has enjoyed its own independent existence since the early mediaeval era. The era of Apabhramsha marks the gradual demise of Prakrit and the birth of various forms of Hindi, also known as Old Hindi, as well as other modern Indian languages.

  

Modern Standard Hindi as we know it today is the daughter of Khadi Boli and the elder sister of Urdu.

  

But Khadi Boli is a form of Hindi. Khadi Boli and her sisters Braj, Avadhi, Bundelkhandi, Maithili, Dhundhari, etc. go back a long way. They are the descendants of Apabhramsha.

  

Thus, Hindi has existed and flourished in India, producing a large amount of excellent literature composed in the Nagari and other Indian scripts, well before the residents of a cold wet sea-faring island known for it bards and pirates set foot on Indian soil.

  

The colonial narrative that Hindi and Urdu were invented at Fort William is complete rubbish!
