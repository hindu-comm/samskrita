Dear list members,

There are these two verses in the story of Nala and Daimayanti(Mahabharata 3-52-15 and 3-52-16 in the critical edition)

where it describes the reaction of the attendants of Daimayantiwhen they first see Nala.

प्रशशंसुश् च सुप्रीता नलं ता विस्मयान्विताः

न चैनम् अभ्यभाषन्त मनोभिस् त्व् अभ्यचिन्तयन्

अहो रूपम् अहो कान्तिर् अहो धैर्यं महात्मनः

को ऽयं देवो नु यक्षो नु गन्धर्वो नु भविष्यति

The line I've coloured means something like:

"Who is he? Would he be a god, a yaksha or a gandharva.?"

The sentence uses thesimple future (लृट्)भविष्यति

I've seen this usage of the future referred to as "future of conjecture".

Would it also be grammatically correct to use theoptative(लिङ्) भवेत् in this kind of sentence.

I.e.को ऽयं देवो नु यक्षो नु गन्धर्वो नु भवेत्

a\) Would that be grammatically incorrect? . I understand that changes themeter but this is only a grammaticalquestion about the use and meaning ofलिङ्.

b\) Would it have the same sense as the original, or would it change the meaning?

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
