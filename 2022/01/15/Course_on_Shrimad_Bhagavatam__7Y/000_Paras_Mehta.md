Namaste to all,

  

I am presenting a course on Srimad Bhagavatam with Sanskrit commentary.

  

A course on Srimad Bhagavatam, the greatest Puranic text, with Sanskrit commentary The Srimad Bhagavatam is likened to the ripened fruit of the desire-yielding tree of the Veda. It is the sāra, quintessence, of Vedic knowledge. Its study elevates one’s consciousness to the realm of pure being and bliss. It has twelve sections and deals with ten topics: sarga (fundamental creation), visarga (subsequent creation), sthiti (regulation), poṣaṇa (nourishment), uti-s (impetus for activity), manvantara (time periods of Manus), īsanukatha (activities of avataras of Bhagavan Vishnu), nirodha (annihilation), mukti (liberation), asraya (ultimate shelter). The tenth topic, asraya, is the main topic of the Bhāgavatam. In this course, the students will gain an in-depth understanding of the following: 1) Philosophy of Srimad Bhāgavatam 2) Nature of the ultimate reality 3) Various avataras of Bhagavan Vishnu 4) The ultimate gain 5) The means to attain it Method: Each verse will be explained by analysing the Sanskrit and referring to a Sanskrit commentary. Philosophical and theological sections will be explained in great detail. The medium of teaching will be English. Classes will be conducted online through Zoom, every Tuesday and Saturday 7-8 PM IST. The initial aim of the course is to complete the first section (751 verses) out of the 12 sections of the Bhāgavatam in 84 classes. Recorded video classes will be available to all registered participants.
