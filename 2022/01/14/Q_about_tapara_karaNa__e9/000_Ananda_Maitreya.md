Hello and Namskar to all gurus!

  

I feel a little hesitant in asking this very basic question...but here goes, regardless.

  

A Sanskrit teacher of mine, a very fine scholar, stated that the tapara in sutras like वृद्धिरादैच् andअदेङ् गुण: is to limit the scope of ā/a. So, in the case of आत् + ऐच्, the tapara restricts the choice to theदीर्घ आ and prevents the remaining 17 possibilities for अ.

  

However, the Laghu Siddhānta Kaumudi of Varadaraja (tr. Kanshi Ram; MLBD, pp. 40-41) and the elucidation on the Aṣtādhyāyi by RN Sharma state that the tapara has nothing to with restricting the a/ā.

  

As per Sharma,

"It should be noted that the t in this rule is not used for constraining ā since ā is not included in aṆ (for details, see 1.1.69 anudit...). Instead, it is used for aiC. Here, taparakarana, enables Panini to block the assignment of the term vrddhi to instances of ai and au which may constitute a time duration of three or four morae (Vol 2. p. 6)."  

  

What is the generally accepted role/function of tapara, then?

  

Thanks in advance.
