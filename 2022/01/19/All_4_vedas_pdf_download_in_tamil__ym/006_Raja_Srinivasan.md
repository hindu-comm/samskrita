No Swamin. These are only the texts in Samskritam with the marks useful for recitation.

  

I have a problem with the meaning in English. The Vedic literature is so complex that full of hidden meaning you have to learn what they mean under the guidance of a qualified guru. Otherwise they are open to misinterpretation and misquotes. If you are looking for just a simple translation I would recommend that you go with Sri Bibek Debroy’s english translations.

  

Let me give you an example with something that many of us chant every day. In the Purusha Shukta (found in all 4 sections of Veda — Rk, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva), there are sentences that politicians have used for their own benefit and to degenerate the Brahmins in general and Vedic Literature in Particular.

  

ब्राह्मणोऽस्यमुखमासीद्बाहूराजन्यःकृतः।  
ऊरूतदस्ययद्वैश्यःपद्भ्यांशूद्रोअजायत॥१२॥

As a young, brash, and uneducated college student, I asked my Guru, Srimad Vedanta Ramanuja Mahadesikan, at that time the head of the Srirangam Andavan Ashram, one evening in Banglore. There were another family with 2 boys (less than 10 years old), and me in the audience. A quite evening. This is what he said: This stanza read on its own says, that Brahmins appeared from the Mouth of the Supreme Being, but the Sudras appeared from the legs. But an analysis of the entire Shukta gives you a different picture. We are talking about Purusha, the Supreme Being, and his qualities. So this can be interpreted in many ways. One way is when Baghawan speaks he speaks the truth and only the truth with knowledge of past, present, and future. The words that comes out of his mouth does not refer to the brahmin caste, but to the ultimate reality, the ultimate truth. In the same way, everything that He does is perfect. He applied the right amount of force to performs his tasks, whether it is using His hands to act like a vaishya or using his feet to perform tasks that a sudra would do. Again these do not define the caste, but refers to the things that we as humans are associated with. In our everyday life, we have to do multiple tasks that include acting as brahmins, acting as vasyas, acting as sudras, and acting as kshatriyas (have you ever killed a spider in the kitchen?). So this stanza does not recommend the caste system or does not place one caste over another. All this says is when Baghavan performs any task, he uses the right amount of power and force and intelligence to get the task done. In other words, if we want to have the qualities of Baghavan, we should dedicate our efforts to completing any task we undertake.

  

Therefore I suggest that you do not ask for the meaning in English in this group. Instead, look to your family Guru and have them explain the meaning. Meanwhile please do listen to Veda. They are in tune with the forces of nature. We are made of the 5 Mahabhutas, like everything in nature. When we listen to Vedic chants, our body gets aligned with the vibrations of the universe and we tend to lead a healthier and more peaceful life.

  

Thanks & Regards
