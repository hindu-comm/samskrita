You can download most of Vedanta in Samskritam in PDF form from VedicReserve website.<https://vedicreserve.miu.edu>

  

These PDFs are formatted to be printed in different sized paper. I find them very readable and enjoyable. They have the markings for recitation purposes. This site also has the Itihasas and Puranas. Special thanks to Peter Freund of Maharishi International University for making these available. My only complaint is, especially with the Puranas, is he should have introduced a page break between Adhyayas.  

  

Thanks & Regards  
Raja Srinivasan
