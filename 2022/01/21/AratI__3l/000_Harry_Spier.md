Dear list members,

I always thoughtआरती (with meaning "waving lights at end of a religious ceremony") was a sanskrit word. But I haven't been able to find it in any of the Sanskrit-English, or Sanskrit-German dictionaries.

Monier-Williams has ā-rati (short i at the end) and meaningf.stopping, ceasing.

  

1) Can anyone confirm for me thatआरती (with meaning "waving lights at end of a religious ceremony" and with this spelling (i.e. long i at the end) is sanskrit. Or is this a borrowing from a modern Indian language?

  

2) If it is sanskrit can someone give me a reference from the sanskrit literature with the word with this spellingआरती.

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
