Ārati (आरति) or Ārātrika is the name of a ceremony of “circular waving of lights before idols” \[Cf.[Nīrājana](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/nirajana#katha)\].—The Nīrājana ceremony was essentially a Śānti or a rite to counteract evil influences. Gradually it lost its military character, but continued as a propitiatory rite. Cf. Rucipati in his commentary on Anargharāghava 2.10. The circular waving of lights was a special feature of the Nīrājana ritual, and that before idols is also known as Ārātrika, popularly called Ārati. In Kāvya poetry the word is often used in the sense of “illumination” or “adoration as with waving lights”.

It seems that the word आरति is used in most of the Indian languages
andआरती seems to be a variant thereof.
