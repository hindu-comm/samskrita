Dear list members,  

I meant to ask:  

Canसह meaning "with" occur within sanskrit compounds (not at the start of the compound). I.e are there sanskrit compounds such as xxxxसहyyyy meaning "xxxx with yyyy". My question is only if such compounds exist, and if so, can anyone can give me an example from the literature.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
