Namaste Spier ji.

  

The compound formation, exceptDvandva and bahupada bahuvrīhi is binary in nature.

So X saha Y is to be first deciphered as (X-saha)-Y or as X-(saha-Y).

saha-Y is a valid compound, leading to sa-Y.

  

Now you need to check whether there will be 'saamarthya' between X and sa-Y to form a compound?

X-sahais not a validcompound. So (X-saha)-Y is ruled out.

saha-Y is a validcompound, leading to sa-Y/saha-Y

  

Now you need to check whether there will be 'saamarthya' between X and sa-Y/saha-Y to form acompound?

  

X-(saha-Y) looks a promising candidate. But I can not imagine any case where X and sa-Y have a saamarthya to join together.

  

Best,

Amba
