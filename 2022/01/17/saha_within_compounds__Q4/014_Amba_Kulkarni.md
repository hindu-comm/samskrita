Sorry, there was some internet issue.

  

Here is the correct message.

  

--------------------------------------------

  

Namaste Spier ji.

  

Thecompoundformation, exceptDvandva and bahupada bahuvrīhi is binary in nature.

So XsahaY is to be first deciphered as (X-saha)-Y or as X-(saha-Y).

X-sahais not a validcompound. So (X-saha)-Y is ruled out.

saha-Y is a validcompound, leading to sa-Y/saha-Y

  

Now you need to check whether there will be 'saamarthya' between X and sa-Y/saha-Y to form acompound?

  

X-(saha-Y) looks like a promising candidate. But I can not imagine any case where X and sa-Y have a saamarthya to join together.

  

Best,

Amba
