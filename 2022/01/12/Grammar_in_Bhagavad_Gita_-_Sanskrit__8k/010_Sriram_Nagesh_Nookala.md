Thank you Amba Kulkarni for options E & F.  
Is there a way to make it sticky? Reason: If I click one of the links to see the Samasa and then I come back to the sloka page, the selections of E& F are lost. If there is someway to keep them sticky per user or per session, that will be helpful

  

Thank you
