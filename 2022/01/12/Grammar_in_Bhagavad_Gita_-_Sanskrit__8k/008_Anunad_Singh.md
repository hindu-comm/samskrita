I think what is being discussed is learning गीता with rigorously analysing grammatical elements of the word/shlokas. What about भट्टिकाव्यम् which is said to have been designed to teach व्याकरण? Wouldn't a prose book like पञ्चतन्त्र be better for learning grammar compared to गीता which is in verse form on one hand and is a philosophical text on the other?
