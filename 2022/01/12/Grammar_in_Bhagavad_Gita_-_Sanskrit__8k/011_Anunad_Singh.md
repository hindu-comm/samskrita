Shri S Venkatraman ji,

I do not have knowledge of Sanskrit grammar beyond 'praveshikA' level. That is why my comment was also in the form of an inquiryonly. I do not have sufficient knowledge or experience to recommend a book that teaches व्याकरण using भट्टिकाव्यम् . I even do not know whether भट्टिकाव्यम् is practically more useful (for learning व्याकरण ) than other traditional books.
