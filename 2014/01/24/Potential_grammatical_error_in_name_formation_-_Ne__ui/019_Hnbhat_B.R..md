In short I can reply only one question back. Are you using the name in Sanskrit Language, when you address him or in any other language you speak.

  

Sanskrit Grammatical rules are applicable to Sanskrit words in Sanskrit Language and the same rules of Grammar need not be applied to the usage of the words in other languages.

  

Now you can decide whether you are speaking/using Sanskrit Language to call him and talk to him and want to follow the strict grammatical rules or not depending upon your own choice.

  

What they have said is correct for Sanskrit Language. So one can call the name of God Krishna, Kisan, Kisan Kanhayya, etc. according to the language one use the names and if you are using Sanskrit Language, for your daily use, it would bhagavat-krishna as a Sanskrit Compound name, with correct grammatical rules used for Sanskrit language. Choice is yours.

  

भगवान् कृष्णः is the sequence in conjugated forms of the adjective भगवत् to qualify the noun in the nominative case singular. The same when you address your son in son, हे भगवन् कृष्ण. The same would be the meaning, when you make a compound in Sanskrit Language according to the grammatical rules for Sandhi and compound formation, which will give you भगवत्कृष्णः in the nominative and हे भगवत्कृष्ण in Sanskrit Langjuage with the vocative case of the compound.

  

Now each language has its own rules of grammar, irrespective of the language from which the word is borrowed. Just like as I have shown above and another example, English is the language of English people use and it is borrowed as such in other languages or with changes according to the rules of gramar for transformation as in hindi - अंग्रेजी or आंगल or any such forms suitably convenient for the language of the speakers. Here also is the same case I have explained for the name कृष्ण borrowed in Hindi in different forms.

  

Don't get confused with the grammar of Sanskrit used for Sanskrit Language for the Sanskrit words. This is just my advice.
