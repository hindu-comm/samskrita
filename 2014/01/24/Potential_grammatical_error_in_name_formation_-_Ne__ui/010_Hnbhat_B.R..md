Yes. There are thousand or innumerous names forभगवान् and one of such names is कृष्ण. Even without Krishna, it it means नारायणः or god simply.

  

'उत्पत्तिं च विनाशं च भूतानामागतिं गतिम्। वेत्ति विद्यामविद्यां च स वाच्यो भगवानिति।।'

  

He can be called by the name नारायण or कृष्ण or any one of the thousand names. There is no dispute.

  

But why should should make an such an odd compound word as a name for a baby when any of the two can be used. It is not uncommon as भगवान्\| itself one of the thousand names as विष्णुसहस्रनाम ---

  

भगवान् भगहा नन्दी वनमाली हलायुधः।

  

as an independent name and

  

तथा देवो भगवान् देवकीसुतः ॥ २० \|\|  

  

is the usage in conjunct as an adjective of कृष्ण.

  

This is the position of the two names or one adjective and a noun.
