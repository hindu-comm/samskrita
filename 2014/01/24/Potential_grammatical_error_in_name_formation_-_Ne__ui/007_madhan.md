Hnbhat B.R. Prabhuji,  
  

Thanks for the reply.

Sorry for not making my question clear enough.  
  

There is no meaning in the name "BhagavadKrishna" (had it been BhagavanKrishna - its very clear!) and its grammatically wrong. The name "Bhagavad Krishna" literally means "Krishna of the lord" or "Lord's Krishna". This as such is meaningless and there are no references to "BhagavadKrishna" anywhere as far as I know. Hence the reason for my confusion, whether to retain the name as such or change the name.  
  
Thanks again for taking time to reply!  

Madhanagopal Murthy!
