Dear all,  
  
Since I wasn't aware of this group, I posted my confusion about the name "BhagavadKrishna" to a facebook group called as "Bhakthivedanta Manor" before posting here and got the following reply from them, today.  
  
# =====  
In Sanskrit there are grammatical rules known as Sandhi and Samasa, coalescence and compound words respectively. Since Sanskrit is a phonetical language, certain rules are applied in order to make various sounds vocally correct. When the end sound of Bhagavan is joined to Gita the lay sound transforms into Bhagavat. This is not applicable when the proceeding words begins with Kri as in Krishna. In that syntax the word remains as a subject of a sentence as Bhagavan Krishna. Therefore from a language perspective you have construed an incompatible name. Since it doesn't carry meaning one would normally not adopt it.

In summary, what I could not understand is that, whether "Bhagavad" is to be considered as adjective to the noun "Krishna" or not? Thanks a lot for the clarification.  
  
Thanks a lot,  
Madhanagopal Murthy
