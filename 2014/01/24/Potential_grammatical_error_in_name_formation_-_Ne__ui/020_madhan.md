Dear Hnbhat B.R. ji,  
  
Thanks for the reply.  
  

I don't know Sanskrit except for very few mantras that I can chant. When I address my son with this name in the written form it would be in English as "BhagavadKrishna" and in Tamil as "பகவத்கிருஷ்ணா" but not in Sanskrit as "भगवत्कृष्ण". Since am not going to refer / call his name in Sanskrit language as you have said the finer grammatical rules are not going to be applied in this context.  
  

Definitely Sanskrit language is not easy as compared to other languages.  

  
Thanks,  
Madhan
