**....the name "BhagavadKrishna"**...

  

While no one can dispute the niceness of the name BhagavadKrishna, it is most likely that after some time you yourself will try calling your son by a shorter name.Most would call him simply 'Krishna'. His friends might call him 'krish'! And so on.

In order to prevent the good name from getting distorted, it might be better to use a simpler name in the first place, like for example, the name Kisan. It has all goodness of BhagavadKrishna and it is simple to pronounce so chances of its getting distorted will be less.

Of course, this my personal opinion!

Subject: \[Samskrita\] Potential grammatical error in name formation - Need suggestion!  

Dear All,  
  
Hare Krishna! Hare Rama!  
  
Namaskaram!  
  
A Krishna devotee was kind enough to suggest this forum to seek answers for the confusion that I have ([http://www.sanskritdocuments.org/](http://www.rediffmail.com/cgi-bin/red.cgi?account_type=1&red=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sanskritdocuments.org%2F&isImage=0&BlockImage=0&rediffng=0)) I am assuming that I can use this valuable forum to clarify the doubt that I have.  
  
Recently, by the mercy of Lord Shri Krishna we were blessed with a baby boy. We decided to name him with Krishna's name. When searching for a name, the name "BhagavadKrishna" flashed me and kept saying that this is the right name for him. I didn't find this name anywhere as far as I know and as far as I have searched in the internet. The name came from the inspiration of "Bhagavad Gita" which means "Song of the Supreme Lord". My understanding / interpretation of the name "BhagavadKrishna" is "Everything in all the universes including Shri Krishna belongs to Shri Krishna. Specifically, all the eternal Jeevathmas belong to the eternal Paramathma - Shri Krishna". But the literal translation is "Lord's Krishna" or "Krishna of the lord" which is looking meaningless or doesn't make any sense. I could sense a potential grammatical error in the name.  
  
1. Should I have to change the name? Or is it ok to retain the name as such just because Krishna is in the name?  
2. "Bhagavan" refers only to the Supreme Lord - Shri Krishna. Can it be used as part of the name for naming a human being, is that acceptable?  
3. Am I misinterpreting the meaning of the name "BhagavadKrishna"?  
4. Or should I simply proceed with the same name as before, without changing anything, with the hope that name is all powerful just because Krishna is in the name?  
  
Am thoroughly confused. Please offer your valuable suggestions regarding this confusion. Its my utter blunder to not clarify and confirm with scholars before finalizing the name.  
  
Thanks a lot for your valuable time!  
  
Hare Krishna! Hare Rama!  
  
Thanks,  
Madhanagopal Murthy
