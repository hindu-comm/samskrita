Your chosen name भगवत्कृष्ण is actually the adjective भगवत् joined with the noun कृष्ण, and literally means कृष्ण endowed with भग fortune, joy, prosperity etc, the वत् suffix being indicative of possession. The normal practice is to conjugate the adjective and the noun separately.
We thus get भगवान् कृष्ण: (Lord Krishna), भगवता कृष्णेन (by Lord Krishna), भगवते कृष्णाय (to Lord Krishna), भगवत: कृष्णस्य (of Lord Krishna) etc. 

  

Yet, भगवत्कृष्ण is not grammatically incorrect, though seldom used. As a name for a person, it is a tongue-twister. It is now upto you to decide whether you want such an odd-sounding and inelegant name for your son.
