Dear Murthy Ji  

Congratulation for having a small master murthy.  

Well about your son name, if you read your mail again, you have wrote that:

  
" When searching for a name, the name "BhagavadKrishna" flashed me and kept saying that this is the right name for him."  

This name flashed and you felt that this is a right name. Your emotions are more important than any other logic. Even many great scholars already mentioned that you may opt this name.  

If you wish you can use krishna as nick name and bhagavadkrishna asschool or proper name.  

This is just my suggestion while considering only your feelings for your son.  
  

Congrats again.  
  

regards  

Ashish Sharma
