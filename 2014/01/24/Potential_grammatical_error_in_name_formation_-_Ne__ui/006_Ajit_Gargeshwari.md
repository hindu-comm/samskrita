Point 1 and 2 "Bhagavan" refers only to the Supreme Lord - Shri Krishna. Can it be used as part of the name for naming a human being, is that acceptable?  
  

The word Bhagavan is usually used to denote respect. As a name Bhagavan Krishna no mortals normally it is for GOD  
  
Point 3 Am I misinterpreting the meaning of the name "BhagavadKrishna"?  
  

My understanding is in Bhagad Gita whenever Shri Bhagavan is mentioned it means the supreme Lord or GOD else it denotes respectful way of addressing a person.

  
Should I simply proceed with the same name as before, without changing anything, with the hope that name is all powerful just because Krishna is in the name?  
  
Whats in a name all named as Krishna cannot become or is God Krishna  
  
Point 1 Should I have to change the name? Or is it OK to retain the name as such just because Krishna is in the name?  
  

What you want to name is your decision anything is or should be OK its better than keeping meaning less name many people keep
