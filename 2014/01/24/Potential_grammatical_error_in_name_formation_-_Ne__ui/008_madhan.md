Hare Krishna ! Hare Rama !  
  

Aurobind Padiyath Prabhuji!  
  

I didn't know that the word "Bhagavad" is an adjective and has got so many meanings. I have been thinking that the meaning of Bhagavad is either "of the Lord" or "Lord's" Seeing your reply, am really delighted and happy. Its an indication that any name associated with Shri Krishna becomes beautiful and adorable name.  
  
So, with the meaning you have specified "BhagavadKrishna" could mean any of the following like,  

"Prosperous Krishna"  

"Adorable Krishna"  

"Happy Krishna"  
  

which by the way are all lovely and adorable names.  
  

Sir, thanks a lot for this explanation. You have made us really happy and relieved of the confusion.  

Sir, if you don't mind where can I find references for the meaning of the word "Bhagavad"?  
  

Thanks again Prabhuji,  
Madhanagopal Murthy
