Dear Madanji,  
I have an android app on my mobile which gives very good help when I get stuck in a word or a phrase while reading and easy to use, not bulky too.  
The app is developed by <http://tecaware.blogspot.in/2013/11/app-developer.html?m=1> . I referred this. But I also cross checked with another Sanskrit English dictionary by M. William published by Motilal Banarasidas.
