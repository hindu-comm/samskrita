Very simple answer is if you love your baby, you can call him with any name you like and do not bother about the meaning of the word you chose as the name. If you chose any name of Bhagavan Krishna, you can be satisfied with it that it is the name of the God you love and call your baby with that name, just like Ajamila who was once a great devotee, but failed to follow his religious duties. Yet named him as Narayana, by calling his son at the end of his life, he attained Vaikuntha loka of Narayana.

  

This is the short and long of naming a baby without bothering about grammar or meaning.

  

I could not at all understand your doubt.
