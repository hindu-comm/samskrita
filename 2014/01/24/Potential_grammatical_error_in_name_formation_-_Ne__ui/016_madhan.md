Dear Ajit Gargeshwari ji,

  
  
\> should be OK its better than keeping meaning less name many people keep  
  

I agree with your point that many people these days keep modern / trendy names without clear meaning for the name. I was being careful that I should not fall into the same trap and specifically have only Shri Krishna's name. Having being clear that it should be a meaningful name, I was more worried whether the name "BhagavadKrishna" would be grammatically incorrect. Now that the scholars in the forum had clarified that **its not grammatically incorrect** and the word **Bhagavad** will be used as an adjective in the name, am more relieved.  
  
Thanks again,  

Madhanagopal Murthy
