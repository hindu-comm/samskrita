Dear Shreyas Munshi,  
  
Thanks a lot for your reply!  
  

I agree with your point that longer names are usually not called out fully. People try to shorten it and these days, names are even shorter. The name "BhagavadKrishna", we didn't frame it. It actually flashed us when thinking of a name. Yes, most of them are calling him as Krishna :)
