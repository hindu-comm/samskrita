This is a well-researched encyclopaedia on the female characters found in Sanskrit literature. It covers all the female characters found in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Not only are all the female protagonists found in the Sanskrit scriptures and epics covered, but also all the objects (sculptures, geographic entities such as rivers, streams, hills, heavenly constellations, mantras, matrikas, nymphs, fairies, angels, constellations, the female species of birds, animals, serpents, insects and fishes, the women who personalise abstract dispositions, mystic powers, heavenly beings, etc.) are described in this unique encyclopaedia which is the result of a 24 year research project undertaken by Dr Sipra Banerjee. Nearly 20000 female characters have been culled from all these texts, and introduced with contextual references.

  

Sipra Banerjee has collated the information available on each female character in each of the epics and pieced it together to give us a beautiful, rather exhaustive ready reckoner on thousands of female characters who people our Sanskrit texts. 

  

This work also sheds light on the weltenschaung of that time, the society, the science known to man back then and the social and political situation of that era.

  

All in all, this set of books is a brilliant scholarly source of information on Ancient India. It is an encyclopaedia that will be treasured for years to come. The publishers deserve great accolades for publishing it so elegantly. It complements beautifully the other encyclopaedia compiled by Dr Banerjee, Sanskrit Vangmaya mein Purush.
