Many English readers would like to read ancient Indian literature. Who does not know that India has a rich tradition of literature in Prakrit, Chandasa, Sanskrit, Pali, Tamil, Kannada and Apabhramsha?

  

One has heard of the Vedas and Upanishads of the Hindus, the Agamas of the Jains and the Pithakas of the Buddhists, the sensuous beauty of Sangam Tamil literature and the elegant imagery of Kannada literature... But the average modern reader, educated in English, often finds himself denied the pleasure of reading India's ancient masters since he does not know Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, etc.

  

Fortunately, there is an option available to the reader now...

  

Ancient Indian Literature - an Anthology in three volumes is the result of a gigantic task fulfilled by certain devoted scholars. It consists of selections from the most ancient of Indian literature, to the comparatively modern writings of the 11th century CE.

  

The texts covered range from religious texts to secular ones. A vast plethora of topics is covered, with a fairly eclectic blend of passages. The idea is to give the reader a taste of the rich variety of thought and the sophistication of the writing. Ancient India's weltenschaung is reflected in these writings.

  

All the texts are competently translated into English.

  

Volume 1: Vedic Sanskrit and Pali

  

Volume 2: Classical Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsha

  

Volume 3: Tamil and Kannada.
