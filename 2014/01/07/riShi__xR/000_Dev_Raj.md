Who is a riShi ?  
  
Are all riShis, vAnaprasthas and householders ?  
  
Are all riShis eternal?  
  
What is the life style of a riShi ?  
  
Do all vedic riShis find place in PurANas ?  
  
What is the difference between a riShi and muni ?  
  
Can a muni be a gotra pravartaka ?  
  
  
Regards,  
Dev
