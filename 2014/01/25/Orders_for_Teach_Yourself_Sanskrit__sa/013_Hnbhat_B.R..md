The same question about learning Sanskrit Grammar online or offline.  
There are so many form generators to know the forms and dictionaries  
to know the meanings. and So many grammar books in different languages  
online and offline for easy reference.  
  
It is computation Sanskrit age and why people are learning grammar in  
schools instead of teaching Computational Sanskrit?  
  
It is not easy to change the system deep rooted for ages. That is the answer.
