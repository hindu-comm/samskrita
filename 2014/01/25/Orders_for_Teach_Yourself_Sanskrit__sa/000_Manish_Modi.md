Dear friends,

  

Some time ago, I advertised that we sell 'Teach Yourself Sanskrit' and met with an overwhelming response! Thanks very much. It is edifying indeed to be appreciated for what I do.

  

The set I had advertised is as under:

  

संस्कृत स्वाध्यायः

SANSKRIT SVADHYAYA

Teach Yourself Sanskrit

for those who wish to study Sanskrit on their own

Set of 14 books

2013 22 x 14 cm 4270 pages

Rs. 1610 for the set

  

<http://www.navelgazing.net/2013/11/sanskrit-svadhyaya-teach-yourself.html>

  

  

This set contains 14 books, demarcated into four levels.

  

Level 1 : Set of 5 books for Rs. 200 (914 pages)

Level 2: 

Set of 3 books for Rs. 200

(834 pages)

Level 3: 

Set of 3 books for Rs. 430

(1009 pages)

Level 4: 

Set of 3 books for Rs. 780

(1513 pages)

  

Now, unfortunately, Level 2 is *out of print.* We hope that the books will come back in print in the next 3 months. But as of now, I can only ship levels 1, 3 and 4. Hence, to all of you who have been kind enough to place orders of full sets, I ask you this question. Would you still be interested in buying the set - without level 2 - or would you prefer to wait till all four levels are available at once. Else, would you be interested in buying Level 1 only?

  

Please write to me and tell me what you would like. I shall await your instructions.

  

  

Here are level-wise details.
