*In Internet age, Why buy Sanskrit books when you can learn using on line resources?*

*Sanskrit is taught in a complex script allover in Indian schools and colleges but how many Sanskrit graduates are fluent in Sanskrit? Will these graduates be able to find jobs as priests or teachers? Look at most Indian Gurus who chant in Sanskrit but communicate in English Why?
  
Most of Sanskrit knowledge have already been translated and available in various languages.*
