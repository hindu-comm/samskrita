Good News for Sanskrit Lovers!   
  
<http://www.navelgazing.net/2014/08/good-news-for-sanskrit-lovers.html>

  
As a lover of Dharma, Sanskriti and Bhasha, I am always enthused on seeing new approaches and new books for learning/teaching Sanskrit. I am a very, very junior beginner level entrant in the world of Sanskrit who was lucky enough to learn under a guru.
