Mr. Ken P,

Our best wishes to you.  Sanskrit books are still necessary even though the computers are available with internet connectivity with all the literature in Sanskrit because there are are good lot of people illiterate on computer but yet good in Samskrit and other local languages.

  

2\. After our Independence Samskrit is relagated to the last position giving preference to English and local languages and hence people studied or studying English and local language generally for earning livelihood or for higher studies.  Thus it became scarce studying Samskrit in our land.  Only a few people take up Samskrit to study having interest in its literature.

Thus very few people who studied Samskrit are proficient in it but very few are there who can understand it when they speak.  That is the reason they (the Swamys etc) turn to English or local language to speak/explain about the contents of the Samskrit books.

श्रीमन्तःभट्महोदयादयःबहवःसन्तिअस्मिन्विषयेविवरणंकर्तुम् ।

धन्यवादाः।
