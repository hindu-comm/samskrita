I see there is a great interest in self-study books to learn Sanskrit. Each and every book has its utility and depending on an individual's way of learning one book might help more than the other. Please try whatever meets your needs best and consider the following.

  

In my experience the best books that I have found to learn Sanskrit are:

सरलसंस्कृतसरणिः, प्रथमो भागः, द्वितियोऽन्तिमश्च भागः, जगन्नाथो वेदालङ्कारः डॉ॰ नरेन्द्रः च, संस्कृतकार्यालयः श्रीअरविन्दाश्रमः पुदुच्चेरी २००३ (<http://sabda.sriaurobindoashram.org>)

  

They are comprehensive and cover entire language in two small volumes and use a very effective method of teaching by getting the learner to make hundreds of sentences using templates. The examples of word and dhaatu usage are culled from the rich Sanskrit literature. It covers most dhaatus with all lakaars, active and passive forms, subanta forms, kRRita pratyayaaH, sandhi rules, and helps develop a rich vocabulary.

  

Please look at the SABDA site, they have many more books on learning Sanskrit. There ordering and delivery process is fast and perfect. The prices are very reasonable and you will be surprised how much you can learn from those books.

  

Please note that I have no direct connection with SABDA. I have used their books and I am certain that many learners can benefit from those books as I have.

  

Thanks.
