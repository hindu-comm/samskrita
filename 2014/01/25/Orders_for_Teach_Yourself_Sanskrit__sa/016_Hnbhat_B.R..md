My simple comment is Language Set up has to be installed in mind  
itself, and then one can speak a language which he has learnt from  
books. Otherwise it is the same condition for any language, other than  
one's mother tounge. It needs special effort for speaking, as in the  
case of foreign languages, in the case of Sanskrit also, Spoken  
Sanskrit is the movement in this direction. No book is necessary, only  
training to speak is the need of the time, as other sources are  
available online and offline.
