It seems that Ramesh has put these quotes from some detailed catalog of manuscripts.  

So, my suggestion is to get the name of library from the same source.  

If it doesn't contain it, better we search catalogs of MSS.  
  

It is not wise to say that just absence of mention by some AchArya is enough to deny any shAstra. If that would be the case, many shAstra-s will become apramANa.  

So, we must try to find MSS and related books.  
  

By the way, I've a question. How many kaula-AchArya-s, who have created any commentary, etc., are known today ? How many of their works are available today?  
  

Although, the kaula cult famous in shAkta works appears opposed to vaiShNava-tantra-s, isn't it possible that the 'kaula' according to viShNu-yAmala has some different characteristics ?
