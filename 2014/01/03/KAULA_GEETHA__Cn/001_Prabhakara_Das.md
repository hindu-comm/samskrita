Vishnu Yamala is for Vaishnava Cult. They are against Kaulas.  
Bhaskararaya didn\`t mention Kaula Geeta. If such a work was there the  
other Kaula authorities would have noticed it. I could not see even a  
mention from famous Kaula Acharyas. How ever, if somebody finds better  
info, I am also curios to know.
