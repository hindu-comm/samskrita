Once upon a time when Sri Morarji Desai when he was Deputy Prime Minister of India was speaking in a Public Meeting in Dehra Dun. He said that if one meets another, they should not

shake hands which is a western practice. But they should say a Namaste with the palms.

This appeared in the Hindustan Times printed at New Delhi. Then I wrote a letter to the editor

of that paper that shaking hands is also an Indian System quoting the following from Valmiki

Ramayna.

  

Kishkindha Kanda Sarga 5 Sloka 11, 12

  

यत्वमिच्छसि सुहार्दम् वानरेण मया सह /

रोचते यदि मे सख्यम् बाहुरेष प्रसारित: //

ग्रृह्यतां पाणिना पाणिर्मर्यादा बध्यतां त्वया //

  

If you like my friendship with this monkey I am extending my hand. Hold this hand with your hand and we shall enter into an agreement.

  

I sent the cutting from that paper which published my letter to Sri Morarji Desai. He replied that

I should have sent the letter directly to him instead of to the Newspaper.
