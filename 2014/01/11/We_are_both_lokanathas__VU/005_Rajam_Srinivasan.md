Respected members of the forum:  
  
Thank you for these wonderful and delightful shlokas. Could some one please post a similar shloka attached to a story (relating to either Bhoja Raja or Vikramaditya) -- an indicted criminal, sentenced to death penalty was broughtin front of the king who allowed him to say any last words before carrying out the death sentence. The criminal responded in a very clever way using the "varna maala". The king who was a "nut" about paanditya (whether from a pandita, or a beggar or a criminal) was so impressed and pardoned the criminal!  
  
I doubtthat modern rulers are that literate!  
  
Thank you in advance.  
  
With warmest regards  
  
A. Iyengar
