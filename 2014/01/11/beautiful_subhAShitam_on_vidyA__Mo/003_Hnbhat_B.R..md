Very simple simple explanation is it the म् at the end of a word doesn't change any consonant doesn't follow.

  

It is changed into अनुस्वार only before a consonant, either stand alone as वृद्धिम् or followed by any vowel like आयाति, एति, इच्छति or followed by any vowel or not. म् + अ = म like क् + अ - क and nothing more.

  

And also, in the beginning itself

itself is split as अपूर्वः कः अपि

which again is a good example to test your knowledge of Sandhi formation and splitting.

  



कोशः and कोषः do no differ in meaning, but only in letters. But they do not change because of Sandhi.
