According to my knowledge--  

वृद्धिम् आयाति उत वृद्धिमायाति\| If it is followed by consonant it should be anusvaar. (उदाहरणम् \`अहं वन्दे')। Here \`व' is consonant. So anuswar is used in \`अहं'। If it is followed by vowel it should be consanant (म्) उदाहरणम् - वृद्धिम् आयाति (उत वृद्धिमायाति।) Here \`आ' is vowel. So consonant \`म्' is used.  

क्षयम् आयाति (उत् क्षयमायाति\|) Same for this word also.

Apart from this I think कोशोयं and व्रुद्धि are typing mistakes. Am I correct?
