subhAShitaM:  

अपूर्वॊ कॊपि कॊशॊयं विद्यतॆ तव भारती ।

व्ययतॊ वृद्धिमायाति क्षयमायाति संचयात् ॥

  
  

pada vibhAgaH:  
  

अपूर्वः कः अपि कोषः अयं विद्यतॆ तव भारती ।

व्ययतः व्रुद्धिं आयाति क्षयं आयाति संचयात् ॥

  

padArthAH:  
  
भारती - bhAratI ( oh! Bharati, can be loosely translated as saraswti, the goddess of education)  
तव - your  

अपि - also (here it is used as an exclamatory, suggestion of wonder)  

कः - which  
अयं - this  
अपूर्वः - special (na pUrvaH - not earlier\[existing\])  

कोषः - Treasure  
विद्यतॆ - exists  
  

व्ययतः - by spending  
आयाति - will bring  
व्रुद्धिं - growth  
संचयात् - by accumulating  
आयाति - will bring  
क्षयं - loss  
  
tAtparyaH:  
oh! Bharati, you have a wonderful treasure. This will grow on spending and will deplete on accumulation  
  
bhavArthaH:  

The author of this verse wonders the beauty of knowledge. He says this treasure of 'bharathi' increases by spending (spreading the knowledge) and will deplete on accumulation (hinting at loss of knowledge gradually, as human memory has limitation)  
  

The beauty of this verse I think is the analogy of treasure depleting on accumulation which is rather a paradox.
