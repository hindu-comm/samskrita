In Sriramas time, there was no payment of wages act etc. specifying when the wages of a workman should be paid. But when Baratha meets Rama in the forest requesting Rama to

go back to ayodhya, Rama makes several enquiries from Bharata. One such is -

ayodhyakandam sarga 100 sloka 32

  

kachidbalasya bhaktam cha vetanam cha yathochitam /

sampraptakaalam daatavyam dadaasi na vilambase //

  

  

कश्चिद् बलस्य भक्तं च

वेतनं च यथोचितम् /

साम्प्राप्तकालं दातव्यं

ददासि न विलम्बसे //

  

balam = army

bhaktam = food

vetanam = wages

sampraptakalam = on the due date

  

Are you giving proper food and wages to the army at the proper time without delay.
