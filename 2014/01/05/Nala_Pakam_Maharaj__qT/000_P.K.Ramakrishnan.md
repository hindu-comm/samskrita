In Mahabharata there is the story of Nala and Damayanti. Damayanti's
father announced the swayamvara of Damayanti and Nala was proceeding for the function. The four Devas - Indra,

Agni, Yama and Varuna met him and wanted that he should convey some message to Damayanti

that they are suiters. Nala first agreed. Later Nala told the devas that he himself was a suiter

and indicated his predicament. But the Devas told him that he had just then agreed to be their messenger and that he should fulfil the commitment. Then Nala agreed and went to Damayanti and informed her that he was a messenger of the four Devas. Damayanti told him that she likes

Nala and he can also attend the Swayamvaram. In the function she could choose him and no

other suiter can object.

  

During the swayamvaram Nala appeared. But all the four Devas also appeared in the form of

Nala. Damayanti was in a difficult position to find the real Nala.
Later she prayed to the gods to

show the real Nala. She then could see the real Nala as he was the only among the group

touching the ground and with moving eyes. She put the garland on the real Nala's neck. Later

when they were dispersing each one of the gods gave a boon to Nala for acting as a messenger. Yama gave him a boon that Nala could prepare the most tasty food.

  

"यमस्त्वन्नरसं प्रादात्"  quotaion from Mahabharata.  

  

This has gone into common parlance as Nala Pakam.

  

Later in his diificult days, Nala and Damayanti were separated. Nala disguised hinself as a dwarf

and assuming the name of Bahuka approaches king Rituparna.

  

In his resume he says:

  

स राजानमुपातिष्टत् बाहुकोहमिति ब्रुवन् /

अश्वानां वाहने युक्त: पृथिव्यां नास्ति मत्समः //

अर्थकृच्छेषु चैवाहं प्रष्टव्यो नैपुणेषु च /

अन्नसम्स्कारमपि च जानाम्यन्यैर्विशेषतक: //

  

He presented himself before the king as bahuka. A good charioteer. Expert in finance. Very good

in cooking.

  

The king gives him the job as a cook and charioteer.

  

In North India a cook is called Maharaj meaning Nala Maharaj who worked as a cook.
