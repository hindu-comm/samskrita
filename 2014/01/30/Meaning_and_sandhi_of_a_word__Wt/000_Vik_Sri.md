namaste,  
  
I was just listening to one of the compositions of the famous music composer Muthuswamy Dikshitar which goes: 'भारती मद्धिषणाजाड्यापहॆ'.  
Could anybody give the meaning of 'मद्धिषणाजाड्यापहॆ' while splitting it? I could of course make out the 'जाड्यापहॆ' but not the other words.  
  
Thanks!
