The origin of āyurveda is lost in the mysteries of time. Since the earliest human civilisation, man has sought ways to heal himself. Human civilisation progressed, bringing in sophisticated thought behind medicine. It is believed that a system of medicine was prevalent in India in pre-Vedic times. The Vedas are the earliest written records of the wisdom and insights of Indian seekers and scholars. They mention Rishi Cyavana and others. The AtharvaVeda especially has several mentions of healers and the medicines they used to cure certain symptoms.

  

In the Jain canon, one of the fourteen Pūrvas (ancient texts now lost to mankind) was ‘Prāṇavāda’. It is believed that the teachings of āyurveda emerged from this text.

  

Jain seers have written several texts in Sanskrit on āyurveda. They are similar in content and findings to Vedic texts, except that no Jain text on āyurveda will recommend the usage of honey, meat or alcohol for their curative properties.

  

This text, the Kalyāṇakāraka, was composed by Ācārya Ugrāditya, a Jain monk who is believed to have lived in the 9th century of the Common Era. This text comprises of 667 hemistichs divided into 25 chapters and one special section on predicting the death of the patient. The chapters cover all aspects of āyurveda with great depth and thoroughness. A special 60 page glossary of ayurvedic terms has been given at the end of the text giving Hindi, Marathi and Latin synonyms of Sanskrit terms used for plants and herbs.

  

Hence, this book, with its deeply insightful suggestions for cures given in Sanskrit verse form and then explained in simple Hindi, is highly useful for all those who pursue holistic wellbeing and can read Hindi comfortably.

  

We are proud to make this text available to seekers of health, well being and bliss through āyurveda. We sell books all over the world and accept payment through Visa, MasterCard and SWIFT.
