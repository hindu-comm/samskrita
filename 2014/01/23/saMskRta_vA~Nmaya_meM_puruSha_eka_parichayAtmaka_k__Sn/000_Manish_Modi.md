This is a magnificent encyclopaedia on Sanskrit literature in Hindi. It is the result of a 20 year research project undertaken by Dr Banerjee, who painstakingly consulted a large number of ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata in all their numerous recensions.

  

Even for the serious student of Sanskrit, and indeed for all those who are keen on Sanskrit literature and epics, it is nearly impossible to read all of the masterpieces available in the Sanskrit language. The language itself is difficult and the literature it has given birth to is vast. It is well nigh impossible for even Sanskritists to have read all of Sanskrit literature.

  

Hence, in this meticulous encyclopedia, Sipra Banerjee has collated the information available on each character in each of the epics and pieced it together to give us a beautiful, rather exhaustive ready reckoner on thousands of male characters who people our Sanskrit texts. 

  

Nearly 40000 male characters have been culled from all these texts, and introduced with contextual references. All those male characters who occur in the two epics as well as in the Puranas are covered in this encyclopaedia. Be they gods, demigods, demons or humans, animals or birds, mountains, oceans, rivers, kings, ministers, scholars or laymen. In addition, there is excellent information given on the various yajnas and other religious rituals, royal lineages of that time, descriptions of ancient Indian kingdoms with their boundaries, and the mountains, hills, rivers, etc. that lay within their territory.

  

This work also sheds light on the weltenschaung of that time, the society, the science known to man back then and the social and political situation of that era.

  

As a bonus, the author has given a large number of hymns and eulogies for most of the gods mentioned in this encyclopaedia. Hence, the entry on Ganesha will have various Sanskrit hymns and eulogies dedicated to him also included in the entry, as well as tales about Ganesha's life, etc.

  

All in all, a brilliant scholarly source of information on Ancient India for the reader. An encyclopaedic work to treasure for years to come. The publishers are to be credited for publishing it so beautifully at such a low price.

  

This encyclopaedia is beautifully complemented by the other encyclopaedia compiled by Dr Banerjee, Sanskrit Vangmaya mein Nari.
