The grammatical description of verbs plays a pivotal role in the study of Sanskrit. In Sanskrit, the description of verb forms is a prominent feature of any grammatical work. Dhātu pāṭha is the basic & primary component of the description of verb forms. Many Sanskrit grammarians have collated all the verbs in Sanskrit and illustrated their verb forms using different methodologies.

  

Dhāturatnākara follows the methodology adopted by Ācārya Hemacandra's Haima Vyākaraṇa. This work has been rendered by the disciple of Ācārya Vijayanemi, Muni

Lāvaṇyavijaya, who went on to become Ācārya Vijayalāvaṇya. His editing is so thorough, that it is unlikely that any dhātu rūpa or verb form of Sanskrit has been overlooked in this veritable ocean of verb-forms.

  

Dhāturatnākara not only complements the Haima Vyākaraṇa; it is a model grammatical work on Sanskrit dhātus, and a must-have for every student and scholar of Sanskrit grammar.

  

The title of each volume is given below.

  

Volume 1 : Tinantaprakriyā

Volume 2 : Nigantaprakriyā

Volume 3 : Sannantaprakriyā tathā Yanantprakriyā

Volume 4 : Yanluvantaprakriyā tathā Nāmadhātuprakriyā

Volume 5 : Bhavakarmaprakriyā

  

The five volumes are attractively published using a fresh typeface; are reasonably priced; more importantly, the proof-reading is impeccable!
