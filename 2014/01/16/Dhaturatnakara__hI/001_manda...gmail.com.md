The five volumes are attractively published using a fresh typeface; are reasonably priced; **more importantly, the proof-reading is impeccable**!

  

I have an edition of 2006 year. Above bold red message was previous time also. I was so naive and thought that can be true. I make my own file with tables of verbal forms. I started to put into that file forms from brihad-dhatu-kusumakara, hari-namamrta-vyakarana, rupa-candrika, dhatu-ratnakara and others sources (and compare them). I noticed that dhatu-ratnakara has hundreds (probably thousands) of mistakes. In Sanskrit, in English, sometimes numeration is wrong, sometimes some root is missed. Nothing is wrong that mistakes are there because it is a big encyclopaedia with huge quantity of forms.

But it is wrong to write that "**the proof-reading is impeccable**!" because so many mistakes are there.  

  

  

I want to say about one really important point. That book **doesn't have alphabetical index**!

It has only list of dhatus from 1st gana to 10th gana (with number for every dhatu) . So if you need to find some dhatu and you don't know number of the gana for that dhatu you have to go through all book (**list of 2054 roots**). But even if you know the number of the gana still you have to go through whole list of that gana because inside the gana dhatus also are not in the alphabetical order (for the 1st gana it is a list of **1058 dhatus**!

  

So the alphabetical index is **very needed**! **All** other similar books which I saw have such index.

Because of despair I started to do this personally. I didn't finish yet but I did a substantial part.

  

Like this:

  

55-\[1\]39 \[okhR\] zoSaNAlamarthayoH, to be dry, to be able \|  
  
56-\[1\]40 \[rAkhR\] zoSaNAlamarthayoH, to be dry, to be able \|  
  
57-\[1\]40 \[lAkhR\]\[lAkh\] zoSaNAlamarthayoH, to be dry, to be able \|  
  
58-\[1\]40 \[drAkhR\]\[drAkh\] zoSaNAlamarthayoH, to dry, to be able \|  
  
59-\[1\]41 \[dhrAkhR\]\[dhrAkh\] zoSaNAlamarthayoH, to dry, to be able \|  
  
60-\[1\]41 \[zAkhR\]\[zAkh\] vyAptau, to pervade \|  

  

First number it is a number of the dhatu, 2nd one tells that it is 1st volume, 3rd number tells a page for the dhatu. So using such index in few seconds I can come to the page I need.

  

Dear publishers, please, make the index for the book.

Moreover it is a good idea to sell book with cd-disk on which there will be text file with the index (for the quick search). Or as an option you can create permanent web link for such a file and print that link in the very book. It will be **extremely helpful**!

  

I give here a link for the file which I created.

One more suggestion. May be you can sell the book with CD on which there will be program in which all forms are available for search. You can protect program. There will be no option for cutting information but search will be available. Sometimes it is not so easy to understand original root.  
  
  
Here is a link for my own project (simple txt file):

Thank you very much. Your book is very useful. I use it regularly. It is the best from what I saw.
