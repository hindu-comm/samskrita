The Dhaturatnakara does not follow Paninian rules, as far as I know.  
  
The question was raised and replied in the other thread according to  
Paninian Grammar.  
  
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/g2By69nomTE/UP4SF089F6cJ>  
  
You can give your opinion in the above thread itself, than repeating  
the same question in each and every thread afresh.
