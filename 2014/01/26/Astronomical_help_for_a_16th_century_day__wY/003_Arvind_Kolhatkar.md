Dr Patel,

  

Perhaps you could consult Sewell and Dixit's \`The Indian Calendar\` available at<https://archive.org/details/indiancalendarwi00sewerich>.
This book gives concordance tables of certain tithis of Vikrama and Shaka systems for various years with dates and days of years of the Christian era. For example, it tells you that 1 Chaitra in Shaka 1366/Vikram 1501 fell on Saturday March 02. The Christian year, by adding 77 to the Shaka year, would be 1443. It can be independently verified thatMarch 02, 1443 Gregorian is indeed Saturday. Thus,1 Chaitra in Shaka 1366/Vikram 1501 was a Saturday.

  

Unfortunately, I could not locate in the book anything about Ekadashi of Kartika Shukla.
