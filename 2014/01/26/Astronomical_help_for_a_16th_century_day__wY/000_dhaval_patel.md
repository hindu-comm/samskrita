Dear scholars,

while editing a manuscript, I landed on a colophon which is not legible. I could manage to decipher the following :

  

॥ संवत्‌ १५०\_ वर्षे कार्तिकसुदि ११ शुक्रदिने । लिखितं पं. कायस्थविनाइकदास ॥

  

But I couldn't find the fourth number in the year.

Can the astronomical scholars / astrological scholars help me find out the year from vikram samvat / shaka samvat 1501-1509 which would satisfy the condition of kArtika sudi 11 and friday.

  

Thanking you all in advance.
