I was having trouble parsing the word मधुराधिपतेरखिलं that appears in the popular hymnमधुराष्टकम्। Given the context, I would expect it to mean "All (अखिलं) of मधुराधिपति is मधुरं", but the only way I can think of decomposing the word is मधुराधिपतिः + अखिलं, which doesn't seem to me to be the same thing.

  

  

  

I am a Sanskrit novice, so I would appreciate any guidance on what is going on here. Thanks,
