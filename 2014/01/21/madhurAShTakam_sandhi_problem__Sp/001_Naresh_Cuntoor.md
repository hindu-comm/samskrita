Piyush,  
If you sandhify मधुराधिपतिः + अखिलम् it would become मधुराधिपतिरखिलम्  

मधुराधिपतेरखिलम्, which appears in the shloka, is मधुराधिपतेः + अखिलम् in its de-sandhified form.  

मधुराधिपतिः = कृष्णः (प्रथमाविभक्तिः, एकवचनम्)  
मधुराधिपतेः = कृष्णस्य (षष्ठीविभक्तिः, एकवचनम्)  
  

Hope this helps.
