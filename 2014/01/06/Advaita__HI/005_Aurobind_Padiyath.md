Namaste.

Hari Om!!!

In theThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ,CHAPTER II,Fourth Brahmana: The Conversation of Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi on the Absolute Self

  

it is said: .....  
When this consciousness gets entangled in the forms of the elements, it is called birth. When it is freed from them, it is called liberation. When it is freed from the elements, it will not be conscious of any particular thing – na pretya saṁjñāsti.  
  
Yājñavalkya tells Maitreyī that when there is total isolation of consciousness from all its associations in the form of these permutations and combinations of elements called the body, there would be no particular consciousness. There would be no feeling, hearing, touching, smelling, – nothing particular whatsoever, no consciousness at all. So bluntly says Yājñavalkya, without commenting on the meaning of this statement, "After dissolution, there is no awareness." This is what is meant by this pithy statement – na pretya saṁjñāsti. Iti are bravīmi, iti hōvāca yajñavalkyaḥ: "Maitreyī, this I tell you. Try to understand it."........."

  

From this one should understand all names and forms of everything including the individual self, the Universal Self, Isvara, Jeeva and Jagat all have relevance only in the waking state. Not even in dream and deep sleep which forms the rest of the life apart from waking. So as long as one is in this plane of existence the rules and Dharma of that state will apply. Also no rules of waking will harm or satisfy in other two states and vice-verse.

  

So theology is valid depending upon what is the current level of experience.

Hari Om!!!!
