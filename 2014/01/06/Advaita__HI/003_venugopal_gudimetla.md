\>\>Considering the concepts of Nirguna Brahman and Maya, can we conclude that Advaitha Philosophy is Non-Theistic and that does God 'exists' only in the illusory world of Maya?

Maya is when one mistakes self as true. That the universe is beyond oneself and endures. If that is true about Maya, and if one says God 'exists' only in the illusory world of Maya, then Maya and God would be subset and superset of one another, hence not different. Sri Adi-Sankara shows that if anything, the notion of self is false, that atman is entity that is the true nature of oneself and God and atman are not distinct. Sri Krishna himself says he is beyond Maya in BG. So above statement that God 'exists' in illusory world of Maya is false. If anything Paramatma is beyond Maya. My 2 cents for what ever it is worth.
