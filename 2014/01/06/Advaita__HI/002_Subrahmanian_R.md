Sirs,

  

I think this question has been earlier asked and answered by Adi Sankara. In his Vivekachudamani, most of which is in FAQ format, the student says, after applying '*neti, neti'* it is observed that there is nothing left and there is no Supreme Brahman. For this the Guru replies thatsuch a position means 'sunya vada' or nihilism which is incorrect. Just as a snake is super imposed on the rope due to ignorance, this world of perception is one that is super imposed on the nirguna brahman. Unless there is a rope, there is no snake and for this world - even though it is illusory - Brahman is required on which it is super imposed.

  

It would further depend on what actually is conveyed by 'non-theistic'. I think, as per Advaita, a personal God is Brahman + Maya. Only Brahman is real. '*Brahma:satyam, jaganmitya'*

  

Respectfully,

R Subrahmanian
