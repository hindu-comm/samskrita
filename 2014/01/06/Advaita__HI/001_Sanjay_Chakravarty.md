Dear Dr. Anil,



God is in the domain of duality (I and God), therefore, yes, what you say is indeed true, as far as my understanding goes. But when one wants to understand God, the understanding leads him into his own Self and he understands there is no God except the Antaratman.



Warm Regards

Sanjay
