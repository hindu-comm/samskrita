नमांसि,

अनुगृहीतास्मि। समाधानं प्राप्तवती च।

Heartfelt Thanks to Madams and Sirs.

Actually it was for my friend, new to Sanskrit, who wanted to know this method.

I told her whatever I could- but then she asked if there was any book/article/information available on this procedure. That made me ask this question.

Now, I too have good information because of her. I will follow the guidelines given to me.

Thankyou again,
