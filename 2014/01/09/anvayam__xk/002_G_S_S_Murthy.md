For what it is worth I give below an extract from a lesson in the "samskrutasopanam" primer written by me.

**Following is the way to analyze a poem in general.**

**1. Locate the verb. Verb will indicate the पुरुष (person) and वचन of the subject.**

2.  **Locate the subject. It will have to be in प्रथमाविभक्ति
    (nominative)** 3.  **Locate adjectives qualifying the subject if any. They will have to
    agree with subject in विभक्ति,वचन,लिङ्ग.** 4.  **Locate the object and its adjectives if any. They will all be in
    द्वितीयाविभक्ति.** 5.  **You now have the basic sentence. Now locate other nouns with their
    adjectives in other विभक्तिs.**

**If there are subordinate clauses you will have to similarly analyse.**

Murthy
