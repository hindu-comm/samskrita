Namaste  

I have some information to seek from elders in the group.  

For a padyam in Sanskrit, we do the "anvayam" = prose-order arranging of words - for better understanding of its meaning.  

Is there any book or a chapter in a book or research paper, article or any material for knowing the guidelines for such a prayatnam? Or is it done according to personal level of understanding of the language element?  
Let the material be in Sanskrit, English, Hindi or Telugu - please let me know.
