Today's news claims that the circular to setup the commission has been withdrawn. Sad news.

  

"The appointment of a Second Sanskrit Commission, nearly 58 years after the first one was set up in 1956 by the first Nehru government, may have been the Congress-led UPA government’s half-hearted bid to ward off the minority appeasement tag attached to it. But in an unprecedented move, the circular was withdrawn within a week of its release, without offering any explanation. It has also been deleted from the ministry website. Even the members of the commission are clueless about the vanishing act."
