Dear and deeply respected members of this group;

  

  ,May I wish you all (me too) a great deal of "santushti" in our addictive and obsessive journey in quest of jewels of Samskrit -- our true Deva Bhash.

  I already feel very blessed that everyday has become an adventure bringing me some gift or other. Thank you all for the magnificent gift of info onmany on-line sources for Subhashitas and much more! 

  Here is a follow-up request. Please let me know if you have discovered an on-line source of English / Hindi translation of "AkSha Malika Upanishad."  I found the Samskrit version in <http://samskritdocuments.org>. I am still looking for English, Kannada, or Hindi translation of the same. 

  I feel that this small (in size -- only 92 short lines!) upanishad is one of the loveliest documents. I hope some of you will enjoy it as much as I do and did.



  

Thank you all very kindly.

  

With warmest regards,

  

A. Iyengar
