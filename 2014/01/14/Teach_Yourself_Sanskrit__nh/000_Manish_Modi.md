The vast ocean of knowledge that is found in Sanskrit literature is a great credit to India and her ancient seers. Sanskrit has been the lingua franca of Indian elite for many centuries. Even today, it inspires a special respect amongst the people of India. Texts written in Sanskrit have a special aura around them.

  

Modern (Paninian) Sanskrit, while younger than Chandasa and some of the older forms of the Prakrits and Sangam Tamil, is one of the world’s oldest living languages. Unlike other ancient languages, it is still spoken.

  

Sanskrit is the daughter of India and like her mother, thrives in variety. There have been several schools of thought in Sanskrit, and each one has acquired its own acolytes and followers.

  

Unfortunately, casteist attitudes ensured that for many centuries, the knowledge of Sanskrit was restricted to the chosen few. But now, Sanskrit is accessible to all.

  

Hence, we have brought to you this wonderful series of brand new, easy-to-use, reader-friendly works which are sold at cost price. This series of books allows you to study Sanskrit on your own, and provides ready made excercises, handy dictionaries and instructive notes besides hundreds of pictures to explain things pictorially.

  

All in all, this is beautiful set of books is just what you were waiting for to start learning Sanskrit on your own.
