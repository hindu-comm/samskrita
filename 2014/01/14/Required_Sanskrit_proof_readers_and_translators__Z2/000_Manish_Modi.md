Learned friends,

  

Two Digambara Jain monks, Muni Amoghakirti and Muni Amarakirti, are currently at the Gulalvadi Digambara Jain temple (near Nal Bazaar/Paydhuni) in Mumbai. They require the services of Sanskrit proofreader and translators from Sanskrit into Hindi. I know all of you are extremely busy but if you could spare some time, it will be wonderful. Please would you come and meet them and see the work for yourself.

  

  

The Jain monks are very nice and if we can find a good scholar, there will be no shortage of work.

  

Here is the address of the temple in which the monks are staying:  

Shri 1008 Parshvanatha Digambara Jain Mandir

216 Kika Street

Gulalvadi

Mumbai 400002

  

We can either go together to meet the monks. Or you can go directly, depending on your convenience.

  

Best regards,

Manish
