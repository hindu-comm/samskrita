Srī mātre namah

Dear group members,

Namaste

Atharva veda tradition is declining so fast .My following post describes such a primary endangered ritual ascribed only to atharvavedins .The shanti udak ritual ( creating pacifying ritual ), which is to be performed with every atharvan karma .  
This is not to be misunderstood with udakshanti of krishna yajurvedins .It is important and very basic ritual of our atharvan tradition.
