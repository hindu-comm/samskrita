I am looking for the etymology of the word उपाधिः  
  
How is it constructed grammatically so as to get its primary meaning? In  
common parlance, it is used in the sense of title, etc., which I don’t think  
is the correct meaning. From Wikipedia and other sources, I gather it has to  
do with the concept of “imposition” or “limitation”. How does that meaning  
come by construction of the word?  
  
  

It is very simple to get the meaning in which it is used in present  
day Sanskrit usage, to mean the titles, B.A., M.A., or विद्यावारिधिः,  
आचार्यः, महामहोपाध्यायः, भट्टाचार्यः etc. which are placed near the  
name.  
  
उपाधिः = उप = समीपे, आधीयते = is placed by. उप+आ+धा + कि. = उपाधिः।  
  
So all the titles are placed after the name, or before the name, as  
महामहोपाध्यायः मल्लिनाथसुरिः, विद्यावारिधिः तारानाथ भट्टाचार्यः etc.  
according to their usage. So what is wrong with the derivation and its  
usage?  
  
There is nothing wrong, in the usage, of the same word in different  
meanings accordings to their usage.
