Sorry. I didn't catch your idea from the whole message. I guess you  
were trying to verify whether the usage of the word उपाधि in the  
modern meaning, "titles" like आचार्य, शिक्षाचार्य, विद्यावारिधि  
Degrees B.A., M.A., Ph.D. is correct or not according to the  
derivation.  
  
You asked for the etymology and I gave the etymology as I found in the  
dictionary and its meanings in classical literature. You seem to  
question its propriety in the above meanings in the modern spoken  
Sanskrit.  
  
VS Apte accepts the word in the above sense:  
  
उपाधिः  
  
उपाधिः \[L=9091\] \[p= 0337-b\] 1 Fraud, deceit, trick. — 2  
Deception, disguise (in Vedânta).  
— 3 Discriminative or distinguishing  
property, attribute, peculiarity; तदु-  
पाधावेव संकेतः K. P. 2. It is of four  
kinds: — जाति, गुण, क्रिया, संज्ञा।  
  
— 4 A title, nick-name; (भट्टाचार्य, महामहो-  
पाध्याय, पंडित &c.); बी। ए। इत्युपाधिधारिणः  
(modern use).  
  
  
Also it is accepted by Monier Williams:  
  
उपाधि  
  
a title, a discriminative appella-  
tion, a nickname; a purpose, an occasion, an object;

Why should you not accept the usage in the above sense used in modern  
language instead of arriving at your conclusion that it is not  
correct?
