Dear Samskrita lovers,



I am looking for the etymology of the word उपाधिः



How is it constructed grammatically so as to get its primary meaning? In common parlance, it is used in the sense of title, etc., which I don’t think is the correct meaning. From Wikipedia and other sources, I gather it has to do with the concept of “imposition” or “limitation”. How does that meaning come by construction of the word?



Warm Regards

Sanjay
