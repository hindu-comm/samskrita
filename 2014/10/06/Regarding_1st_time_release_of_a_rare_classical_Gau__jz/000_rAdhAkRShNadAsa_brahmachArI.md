Dear devotees,

  

PAMHO! AGTSP! Hare Krsna.

  

On Wednesday, 8th October 2014 AD corresponding to the Sri-krsnaa-saradiya-rasa-purnima Day, at 12:00 hours IST, the serialized first section of our e-book will be launched on our blog -

  

[rkdb.wordpress.com](http://rkdb.wordpress.com)

  

and also on the author's Facebook Timeline

  

(<https://www.facebook.com/radhakrishnadas.brahmachari>).

  

The Foreward in the said book is graced by His Grace Sriman Pundrik Goswami Maharaja - the 16th direct apostlic descendant of Srila Gopalabhatta Gosvamipada i.e. the contemporaneous eternal associate of Sriman Mahaprabhu Krsnacaitanyadeva and the 'Guna-mañjari' of the nitya-vraja-lila.

  

  

The official designation of the said book will be - "The Chemistry of Divine Aesthetical Love" (Essential Collection of the Succulent Mellows of Vraja-bhakti). The said rare book shall constitute the first time English rendition of a 17th Century Sanskrit work composed by the grand-disciple of Srila Krsnaadasa Kaviraja Gosvami Prabhuvara. Indeed, the said treatise has not been rendered in any existing language of the globe anytime before. It will also be adorned with our elaborate exposition on the matter. The dedication of the said treatise is made to Srila Rupa Gosvamipada & HDG AC Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada.

  

Moreover, all the core esoteric aspects of the Gaudiya Vaisnava Theology have been critically analyzed in it to put rest to all ambiguities existing within the lineage of Sriman Mahaprabhu Krsnacaitanyadeva.

  

The said treatise shall be published on behalf of the Bhakti Rasa Vedanta Foundation (Bharata) Reg. and its Founder viz., HG Ramamurtidasa Vanacari Prabhu (ACBSP). Haribol.
