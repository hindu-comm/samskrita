If you had googled, as you have typed here, you also could also have  
found the above and many other blog spots with prahelika. Try your  
best luck by googling more.  
  
  
  
I got an information on a book:  
  
In 1982, Gurupad K. Hegde wrote an entire book titled “Pun in Sanskrit  
Literature”. It was published by Mysore College and has more than 300  
examples  
  
Please try if you can get copy of it. You can also search and see if  
you can get more results. You can search our group itself and get some  
threads started with Prahelika.
