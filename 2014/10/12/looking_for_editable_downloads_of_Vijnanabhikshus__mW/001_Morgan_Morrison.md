Namaste Taft Rivers,

On this web page (left upper box, at approximately the eleven o'clock position), you will find downloadable files of the Sinha work (originally published in 1915) in several different formats. One or more of these formats may be editable for your work and research. The scanned pages of the 1915 book, saved as a PDF document are not the best quality images for OCR scanning purposes. However, you might be able to sharpen or otherwise clean up these images with the appropriate image editing software, depending upon which computer system(s) you are using. There is also a Kindle edition of the Sinha work, available from Amazon.com, which may be a better source text to work with. While the source for the Kindle edition is the Internet Archive, the Kindle edition appears to be in a clear, black typeface with no problematic images that you have encountered with the scanned pages edition of the Sinha work, (saved as a PDF document). The URL for the Kindle edition is:

  

<http://www.amazon.com/The->samkhya-philosophy-Nandalal-Sinha-ebook/dp/B00CF2XIUU/ref=tmm\_kin_title_popover  

  

The Kindle edition is priced at US$0.99 and is available as a download. The Kindle format may be saved as a PDF file and edited with either Adobe Acrobat software or a number of other PDF editing software programs, available for both the Apple Mac and Windows PC computer platforms.

  

Best,
