Thanks Morgan,

  

Actually I already have both an electronic and good print copy of that particular version!

  

It isnot exactly the original 600 page multi-commentary 1915 version!

  

Of its actual200 pages, page after pagearejust the indexes of thosecommentaries -but mysteriously without the accompanying commentaries.The money only gets youthe 67 pages ofthe original SamkhyaKarika of IsvaraKrishna, which is not exactly hard to come by in any format.

  

I have discovereda clean, albeit scanned OCR pdf, of 'Samkhya Karika of Isvara Krsna (Krishna) with The Tattva Kaumudi of Sri Vacaspati Misra' published by Sri Ramakrisha Math of Mylapore, Madras.

  

TheEnglish is good,withusefulexplanation of the Sanskrit technical terms in plainEnglish, ratherthaninthe usual somewhatunhelpful wayofyet other unexplained mysterious Sanskrit terms.

  

I have placed an order for the bookitself (from[www.exoticindiaart.com](http://www.exoticindiaart.com)GBP 3.75, post free).

  

... but as yet, no easy note-takingformat.

After thousands ofyears,a satisfactoryexplanation of the unexplainable remains...

  

.. and by the time the unexplainable is experienced for itself - it's too late!
