Hi all,

  

 I aminterested in the later commentariesof the classic texts, as these do seem to offer a more pragmatic rather that mystic interpretation.

  

However, I am unable to locate editable versions.

  

As an example text,there is a downloadable version of this work:

 Nandalal Sinha, *The Samkhya Philosophy*, New Delhi: Oriental Books Reprint Corporation, 1979.

that Contains a complete translation of Vijnanabhikshu's *Sankhyasutrabhashya*.

  

It has the original Devanagari sutras, their word-separated transliterations withinterpretationsin equivalent English terminology, which is exactly what I am looking for.

There is aparticulardownload in "'pdf" format,but which is nothing of the kind.In reality it is simply a collection of images of scanned pages.

And scanned pages do not lend themselves to word processing operations!

  

It does take a good deal of effortto produce accurate textual equivalents of these scanned texts, andenthusiasts dothe major works first.

I have done somework myself for selectedextracts, but I am your typical two-fingered male typistand it takesfor too long to make much progress!

  

So, can anyone direct me toreal pdf sources,or even xml, html, rtf,ASCIIversions, please.

(I mean of these particular works, I've triedthe libraries).

  

  

Cheers,

  

 Taff Rivers
