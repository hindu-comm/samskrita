Dear Sri Animesh,

This is good service for the cause of Vedic studies. If KaTha BrhamaNa can be traced and published, it would help "history of astronomy" also.

The Katha-Brāhmana is the only available Vedic text which names all nine Grahas, that is planets.At present only fragments of the text are available openly.

In the published Kāthaka-samkalanam, (Suryakanta, Lahore, 1943) sections 4, 5 and 6 are

titled, Grahesti-brāhmanam, Grahesti-mantrāh and Grahabrāhmana m respectively. The first among these is a typical

Vedic text in prose with modulations. This names the celestials as Āditya, Śukra, Brhaspati, Budha, Bhauma, Saura, Candramā,

Rāhu and Ketu in that order. The next section is in plain verse starting with laudations to Agni and Soma. This is followed by

hymns to Sūrya, Śukra, Brhaspati, Budha (Soma-śiśu), Vakrī, Śanaiścara, Candramā, Svarbhānu, and Ketu. We see here one

to one correspondence between the two sections in the order of the objects and also the equivalence between Bhauma and

Vakrī; Saura and Śanaiścara; Svarbhānu and Rāhu.

Keep up the good work. I have seen a Ph.D thesis on Katha Aranyaka done at Harvard University.

  

Thanks for sharing the text
