Srī mātre namah

Dear group members ,

Katha shAkhA ( charak katha shAkhA ) is one of the minutely studied shAkha  
Prevalent among kashmiri pandits.Recently I got an old book " fragments of katha aranyaka " from local library and , have posted the mula text of Aranyaka bhaga of katha shAkhA on my blog .( since I was not allowed to scan or Xerox the book as it was too old so I copied complete text )  
I request all group members to visit it on my blog . You may simply select the text in devanAgrI script and print it ( if you want ).
