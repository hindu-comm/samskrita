Sir;

  

Thank you most kindly for your post on katha shAkha. ButI think I need tostudy it again in the company of someone who knows Sanskrit better than I do.

  

However, my overwhelming gratitude is due to your write-up on "vaadhuula" suutraas:)) I am from vaadhuula gotra. I was/am fascinated by your blog. I would like to know more about him, especially about sulba suutraas mentioned in your blog. Is there any source, on- or offline that one could access? Any source in any language is welcome.

  

Thank you again for this wonderful (for me most treasurable) gift.

  

Warmest regards
