As per:

It seems that prashna 27 contains just that

Works of Aapasthamba  
Maharishi Aapasthamba was himself embodiment of Veda. His Sutras are  
entirely Vedic. He was appointed as ‘Sutrapravartaka’ Rishi by Brahma  
in order to firmly establish, protect and propagate Vedic dharmas. He  
carried out his divine duties responsibly and authored Sutras with  
great mastery. The commentators of Sutras accept that among Sutra  
works, Aapasthamba Sutras have a special place owing to their style  
and deep meaning.  
  
Aapasthamba has written Sutras for complete Yajurveda, known as  
Adhvaryu branch (of Veda). They are of three types: Sroutham, Grihyam  
and Dharmam. In Sroutha Sutras, he explains yaga karmas as per rules  
of Yajur Veda. Grihya Sutram deals with Smartha karmas like  
upanayanam, marriage etc. Dharma Sutram goes into common dharmas.  
  
Aapasthamba wrote Sutras, consisting of 30 Prasnas (sections). They  
cover dhamas of Sroutham, Grihyam and Smartham. In 5 Prasnas starting  
from the 25th, Grihyas and Smarthas are covered. Here Smartham refers  
to Prakrita Dharma Sutram. 24 Prasnas deal completely with Sroutha  
karmas. In the 25th, Paribhasha, Houtram and Pravaram are covered; in  
the 26th, usage of mantras in marriage etc.; in the 27th, Grihya  
usages including Pitru medham; in the 29th and 30th Prasnas,  
kalpasutras for yagavedis (altars for yagas). This is the division of  
subjects in Aapasthamba’s 30 Prasnas; this is clear from the ‘karika’  
of Kapardi.
