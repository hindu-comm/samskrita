Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. **At the outset may I wish you all a very happy Diwali! May The Festival of Lights illuminate our lives in all respects!**

  

In this connection, I am glad to share a very short and sweet **Vishnu Ashtakam** from **Nrusimha Puranam**. This hymn was recited by the dwellers of **Naraka** (hell) and they were escorted by Vishnu dhootas to the abode of **Vishnu** as per **Sage Vyasa**. In the subsequent chapter, **Lord Yama** gives instructions to his servants (which is titled **Yamashtakam**) where he confirms that he does not have authority over those sheltered by **Lord Vishnu**.

  

Though I wanted to share something more, time is a constraint and therefore I squeezed little time to come out with a short one.

  

Once again, hearty greetings for a joyous Diwali festivities and the turning the inner light on!
