I was aware of this and another which describes navarasas in rAma -  
sRngAram kShitinandinI viharaNe vIram dhanurbha\~njane  
  
I found that only the bharatanatyam dancers Balasaraswati and Lakshmi Knight have danced for the Siva navarasa sloka. This actually occurs in the documentary of Balasaraswati by Satyajit Ray.  
  
Thanks.
