Dear Sir,

  

You will have to convert the .djvu files to .pdf format using the steps described below. However, note that it is not desirable to convert to .pdf because they will become very large files. It is better to use a utility for reading .djvu files directly.

  

Steps:

  

1\. Download and install one of the .djvu readers from <http://djvu.org/resources/> and install it. I prefer WinDjView. With this utility you will be able to read .djvu files and actually don't really need to convert to .pdf. In case, you still want to continue, follow the next steps.

  

2\. Download a virtual printer utility like pdfcreator e.g. <http://www.pdfforge.org/pdfcreator> and install it.

  

3\. Open the .djvu file (say using WinDjView) and print to a printer called pdfcreator that you will see in your system. It will ask you the name of the file to save as. And thus you will have a converted file.

  

But as you might notice, these are scanned pages and thus after conversion to pdf will become very large files. The pdf format is MUCH more inefficient for such scanned matter. Hence, IMHO, it is better to stick to .djvu format.

  

Regards,
