I think some lectueres or upanyasa-s on Shankarabhashya may be available.

I don't think there is any givingपद-छेदः ,

विभक्तिः , समासः विग्रह-वाक्यः for the Bhashyam of Adi Sankara unless some one has prepared in any blogspot.

It may be noted that Shankarabhashyam is not a book for beginners learning theपद-छेदः ,

विभक्तिः , समासः विग्रह-वाक्यःand the Shankarabhashya has subcommentary of Anandagiri already pubished which explains the words of the Bhashya and its sentences.

There are commentaries on all the Bhashyams to help to understand the Bhashyam by Anandagiri.
