भवन्तः प्रणाम,

  
1. Is there any teaching material like Bhagavad Gita Workbook for Bhashyam  
of Adi Sankara?  
  
Is there any book from Gita Press or any other that gives the पद-छेदः ,  
विभक्तिः , समासः विग्रह-वाक्यः for the Bhashyam of Adi Sankara for purchase?  
  
2. Is there any teaching material related to the Bhashyam of the Upanishads  
by Adi Sankara?  
  
3. The Shabda Kalpadrumah CD by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is out of  
stock. Does anyone have it so that it can be purchased?  
  
4. Is there a CD or Book giving the Root (धातुः) and KRit Affix  
(कृत-प्रत्यय:) for the nouns encountered in literature (or the sabdas in  
the book Sabda Manjari) ?  
  
Thank you धन्यवादः  
  
जय गुरुदेव  
अश्विनी
