sabhayai nama:

  

This website [valmikiramayan.net](http://valmikiramayan.net) was an immense treasure for Samskrita abhimanis. It had the entire Valmiki Ramayana with shabdartha, anvaya and even pronounciation. I presume many here would be familiar with that site.

  

Recent few days the website is down with message "This Account has been suspended." I know the website was maintained by Late Shri Desiraju Hanumantharao ji. I don't know who maintains the website now nor I could get the contacts. That is the reason I am posting here.

  

If you anyone know the details, please share.

  

Dhanyavada:

Srikanth.
