The 'Maha Periaval Trust' has published the Soundarya Lahiri with \~8 traditional sanskrit commentaries (and tamil translations). It is available from the link above as a pdf file.

  

Though you already have an answer to your question (sloka #60), I thought I'd share this link anyways.

  

sasneham,
