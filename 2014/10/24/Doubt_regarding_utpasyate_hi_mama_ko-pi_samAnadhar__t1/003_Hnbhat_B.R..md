Better to refer to any commentary, Rasamanjari or Jagaddhara, Veeraraghava for a grammatical explantion of the expression, I do not have any text with or without commentary.'

  

There not any restriction on continuous verbs: like this:

  

"त्वं पासि हंसि तनुषे मनुषे बिभर्षि विभ्राजसे सृजसि संहरसे विरौषि ।

आस्से निरस्यसि सरस्यसि रासि लासि सङ्क्रीडसे ब्रुडसि मेघसि मोदसे च"।

  

In this context better to refer some commentary. अस्ति is used as an अव्यय also, as in अस्तिक्षीरा गौः.
