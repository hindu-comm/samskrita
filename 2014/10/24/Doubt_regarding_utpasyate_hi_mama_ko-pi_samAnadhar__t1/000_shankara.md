Pranams to all,

  

A quote from Malati-Madhava 1.6, is found in a letter of Swami Vivekananda in online and print editions.

<http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/epistles_fourth_series/111_rakhal.htm>

  

Relevant part from this letter is given below.

  

"This is my prayer, O brother. "उत्पत्स्यतेऽस्ति मम कोऽपि समानधर्मा — certainly there is, or there will be born one equal to me"; some one or other will certainly arise from these thousands of devotees of Shri Ramakrishna who will be like me, and who will be able to understand me."

  

In print editions of Malati-Madhava, this quarter of the verse is given as उत्पस्यते हि मम कोऽपि समानधर्मा. Is the quote in Swami Vivekananda's letter "उत्पत्स्यतेऽस्ति मम कोऽपि समानधर्मा" grammatically correct? Can अस्ति be used there immediately after उत्पत्स्यते? Please explain.  



regards  
shankara
