Shankara,

  

I have always known this verse as 'उत्पत्स्यतेऽस्ति मम कोऽपि समानधर्मा'.
It was explained to us thatउत्पत्स्यते means 'will come into being, will spring up' and addition ofअस्ति after that is a stylistic use, indicative of an established fact, as in ’अस्त्युत्तरस्यां दिशि देवतात्मा’. The expression 'उत्पत्स्यतेऽस्ति मम कोऽपि समानधर्मा'. thus translates as 'it is a fact that at some time in future there will be someone who thinks as I do' becauseकालो ह्ययं निरवधिर्विपुला च पृथ्वी.

  

I do not know if this usage is also supported by any rule of grammar.
