Bhat Sir,

  

Thank you very much for example with multiple verbs. I checked the commentary of Malati Madhava by Jagaddhara published in Bombay Sanskrit Series, edited by RG Bhanadarkar. Attaching the page containing commentary on this verse.

  

Relevant part of the commentary is like this - उत्पत्स्यते जन्माप्स्यत्यस्ति विद्यते वा तं प्रत्येष यत्न इति भावः।  

  

Does the commentator mean that 'this effort is for the sake of someone similar to me might take birth sometime in future or who exists somewhere at present'?



regards  
shankara
