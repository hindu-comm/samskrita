Thanks for sharing the detail of book which I forgot to list.  

There are many which I haven't listed, because I don't have any list now. I wrote from memory.  

BTW, a hindi commentary of yoga-sUtra which is based on vivaraNa of sha\~NkarAchArya, was publihsed a few months ago.  
  

A sanskrit prakaraNa dealing with tattvamasi, titled tattvamasi, was published in two parts. It is in shloka form.  
  

There is another sa

nskrit prakaraNa to explain vivaraNa-matam, vivaraNaratnamAlA.
