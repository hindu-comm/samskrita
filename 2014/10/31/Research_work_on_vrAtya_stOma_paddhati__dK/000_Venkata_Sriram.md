Namaste,

  

I was going through some of the collection of articles of Prof.B.Narasimhacharya, (Retd.), Dept. of Sanskrit, Osmania Univ. Quite a few of them were the radio talks in Akasavani, Hyderabad. Among the collections, the 1st article was on "vedas and national integrity" ('vedamulu - jAteeyasamaikyata' in telugu). In the due course of this article, the professor mentioned that in the vedic period both Aryans (people who followed the vaidika jeevana paddhati) and anAryans (also called dasyus) (who followed avaidika jeevana paddhati) used to live together with unity and brotherhood.  There was also a war between these two categories and in due course the Aryans conquered dasyus and converted the avaidika dasyus into the Aryan fold by performing a stOma called "vrAtya stOma". He also quote a mantra from rg veda as:

  

"janaMbIbhritI bahudhA vivAchasaM nAnA dharmANaM ............rasa pasphurati"

  

However, from what i understand from smriti granthAs is that this rite is performed when upanayana ceremony is delayed and if not performed in right age.

  

I would like to refer to this rite and would like to know whether any research paper has been published on this stOma or not. I was told that when Harihararaya & Bukkaraya were re-converted into the hindu fold by Sri.Vidyaranya, a similar rite was performed.

  

Thanking in advance.

  

regs,

sriram
