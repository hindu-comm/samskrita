Great to see you back.

  

Well done.Radiobuttons can't be without a selection.

पुँल्लिङ्ग स्त्रीलिङ्ग नपुंसकलिङ्ग by default are unselected. Impossible as per HTML guidelines. And why do I have to provide so much detail as
ङ्‍यन्त, नदीसञ्ज्ञक (गौरी) अङ्‍यन्त, नदीसञ्ज्ञक (लक्ष्मी) ङ्‍यन्त, इयङ्स्थानिक (स्त्री) अङ्‍यन्त, इयङ्स्थानिक (श्री) ?

Oh and as mentioned sure it's slow. Now I understand why - the results page is so huge I hardly understand how it works. I need a manual on it and a TOC would not hurt as well. Still as before I do not get what's the use of identical forms:

Final forms are :

आखिरी रूप हैं :

1 - अंबवतीः

2 - अंंबवतीः
