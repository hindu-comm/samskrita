Respected all,

  

Please find attached link to a subanta generation machine on PHP platform.

<http://lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/subanta.html>  

  

  

The supported inputs are devanagari, IAST and SLP1.

  

When one enters a word and selects proper gender,

the machine generates the step by step derivation for all 21 sup pratyayas in a single HTML file. sambuddhi forms are given after sup. So a total of 24 derivation process is given. You may save it for your reference.

  

Sample page is attached herewith.

The machine is preliminarily tested till ajantapulliGga, but should work for others also (albeit with some issues).

  

Please be patient with the slow speed of site. It will give the results nevertheless.

  

Feedback - Please share it offline on [drdhav...@gmail.com]() to stop inconvenience to other scholars.
