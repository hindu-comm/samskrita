With the growing interest in this theme,it is worth remembering the work of the Sanskrit savant, Kavyakantha Vasishtha Ganapati Muni (1878-1936 A.D.)

[Vol 5, The Book of Aphorisms - Part 1 ( Sutragranthamala ), by Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni](http://www.scribd.com/doc/113278466/Vol-5-The-Book-of-Aphorisms-Part-1-Sutragranthamala-by-Kavyakantha-Ganapati-Muni)

  

In Vol. 5, Section 30, titled Samrajya-nibandhanam, he had drafted a constitution for an

independent India.

  

Hope some scholars would take up translating and commenting on this work.

  

He had also addressed IN SANSKRIT the Congress Party annual meeting in Belgaum in 1924. If someone has access to this work, it would merit further study.
