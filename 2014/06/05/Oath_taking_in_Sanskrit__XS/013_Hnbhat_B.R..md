There are two views. Popularity in the general interest is the governing guide for common man:

  

महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः।

  

So oath taking by a cabinet minister adds to the value of Sanskrit, making it popular, whether the oath taken in language is kept in and observed through out the period of 5 years or not loyal to the words of the oath, whether in Sanskrit or any other language.

  

सत्येन पन्था विततो देवयानः --

  

  

The abiding by the words of the oath, is the way of Gods, whether the oath is taken in Sanskrit or any other language. This the path of देव-s whether they speak देवभाषा or any other language in Cabinet.

  

This is what Sanskrit heritage taught in both ways and all is free choose one of the both or both together and not isolated देवयान and देवभाषा। Why to stick to one or argue down the other? This is democracy and freedom of opinion. And it is not just cabinet ministry or देवभाषा alone.
