I hope the new government will do something Good for Sanskrit. More money needs to be alocated to Sanskrit and Sanskrit Studies. There is long standing demand to give Sanskrit a classical language staus or make it a national language. The Second Sanskrit commision has been set up. The recomedations of the first Sanskrit commsssion itself has not been implemented fully.  
  

Whether one speaks in sanskrit or not or whether the oath is taken in Sanskrit or Pali will make no difference. We need to raise above such gimmicks We had had seen enogh in the past.I hope 'achhe din ayenga should be converted to 'acche din a chuke'
