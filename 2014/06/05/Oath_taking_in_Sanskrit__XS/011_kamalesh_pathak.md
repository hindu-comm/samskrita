learned group members,

i am neither scholar nor learned.i am typical pandit angeged in traditional PAUROHITYAM.

to spread sanskrit nationwide - am i allowed to say something here please ?

1\. national and state governments will do their work at their level but we people have to work hard for atleast 2 decades at (a) academic level (b) micro interior level to metropolitan level (c) away from caste and tribe level (d) infant level to retired seniors level (e) LKG to PG level with all type of study.. may it language study or science or I.T. or management to marketing and raw material to finished goods and manufacturing point to end user.

2\. no matter sanskrit still not given the status of national language.... once people will allow sanskrit in routine this divine language will rule over india with home in heart of every indian.

3\. we are not in politics and its not our profession , of course politics affects us direct and indirect both way but we have to prepare our self to maintain a safe distance with it eyeing goal to sanskrit.

4\. largest team of dedicated volunteer so far not developed - rest all effords are less impotant and such team will not come from team modi.. it can come from us and this is right time to creat the team.

5\. no one knows what will happen next morning.. we are not astrologers but we can trust to the almighty that our nobel idias and humble efforts turn to spread the sanskrit nationwide.

  

JAYATU SANSKRUTAM.

regards,

kamalesh pathak
