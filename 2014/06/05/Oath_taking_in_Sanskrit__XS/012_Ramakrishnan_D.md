Dear Kamalesh Pathak Mahodaya !

The dedicated volunteer organisation is already there working for the last 40 years or so by the name "Samskrita Bharati" spreading Samskritam through sambhashana sibirams through out India and in many foreign countries.  Now lakhs of people are there in the country who can understand and speak the language though not with proficiancy.  Only the ruling party has to make up its mind to make Samskritam as national language and convince all the people in the parliament.
