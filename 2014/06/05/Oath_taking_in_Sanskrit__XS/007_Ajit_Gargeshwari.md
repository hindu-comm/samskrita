There is room for all to exists and exist well and enjoy Sanskrit. I am not suggesting an exculsive propsition  
  
Let me put it this way

 unless one does high quality research happens

 how will the good of our past or present it peculate down to society.

 Except in the field of writing novels or stories all other domains of Sanskrit or any other learning requires depth or domain expertise right. Say unless you have high quality theoretical physics research how can one have good science fictions or make gadgets which will help society.  
  

Popular views may or may not be correct . There is a difference between how history or Sanskrit is looked upon by a scholar and non scholar. A non scholar is most important for he will have to fund the scholar and the scholar needs to impress him surely this is not ideal.
