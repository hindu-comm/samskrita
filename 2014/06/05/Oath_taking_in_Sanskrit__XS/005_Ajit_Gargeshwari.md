I am in agreement with Murthy. That is what i have trying to drive home in this thread and in many other thread. If we simply artificially speak in Sanskrit or write two or three sentences in Sanskrit it is not going to help Sanskrit much but might be big thing for an enthusiast. Unless one does high standard high quality original research and make Sanskrit studies relevant and important this language will never become popular or will never be main stream research or will loose its relevance.
