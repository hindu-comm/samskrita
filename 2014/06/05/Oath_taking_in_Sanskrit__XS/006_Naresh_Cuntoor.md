High quality original research is necessary. But how does that translate to popularity? It seems to me that you have it backwards. Popular fields attract more people. And eventually high quality work emerges.  
  

Why look at this as a mutually exclusive proposition? Why should you encourage scholarship at the cost of popular usage, or vice versa? Surely there is room for both.
