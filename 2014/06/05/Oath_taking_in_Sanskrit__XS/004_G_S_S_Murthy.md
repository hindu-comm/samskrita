Oath-taking in Sanskrit or using Sanskrit for communication in this group is certainly laudable but has limitations when it comes to developing Sanskrit language and literature.

In my view, there is no dearth of funding for Sanskrit even as of date. Much of it goes to providing salaries to Sanskrit scholars in the various universities and Samsthans spread all over India. Precious little really original and creative is getting done there. If you look at the innumerable journals coming out from them, you will realize this. Most contain articles of very little originality.

  

It is a pity that many youngsters who have a good grip of IT and who are learning and have learnt Sanskrit are backward- looking. They want to bring out to the world the glory of Sanskrit hidden in Puranas and the Vedas and other religious texts.

Even today, much and the best of software written for Sanskrit emanates from Western Universities and Western scholars. Even in area of so-called Indology, the Western scholars are in the fore front. When a Westerner studies Sanskrit it is a passion;when an Indian studies Sanskrit it is for a living. I am exaggerating for effect.

Sanskrit scholars have to bring out the best of world literature in Sanskrit. I do not know if any one of the Sanskrit universities has any project in that direction. We do not even have standard dictionaries from other Indian languages to Sanskrit. We need to have books written in Sanskrit on modern science, technology and liberal arts. I am not sure if we have text books on all subjects written in Sanskrit for high schools let alone colleges.

I am afraid I am going against the main stream of Glory that was India. I am certainly not afraid.

Enough for now,

respectful regards

Murthy
