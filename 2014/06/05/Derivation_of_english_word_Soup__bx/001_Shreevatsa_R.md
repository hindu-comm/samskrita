Such common English words are rarely derivatives of Sanskrit word‌s per se (there are perhaps at most a couple of dozen or so [Sanskrit-derived words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Sanskrit_origin) in common usage); it's more meaningful to ask whether a certain English word is a [cognate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate)(having a common etymological origin) of a similar-seeming Sanskrit word, or whether they are [false cognates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_cognate) (i.e., whether the similarity is a coincidence). (For example, the English word "mother" is not *derived* from the Sanskrit word "mātṛ", but they are cognates.)

  

We need to know both the etymology of "सूप" ‌and that of "soup".

  

For the former, [Monier-Williams has](http://beta.learnsanskrit.org/dict/mw/q-hk/sUpa):

सूप  
-   m.(of doubtful derivation cf.सूद; inUn2. iii, 26said to be fr.
    √3.सु,“to distil”)sauce, soup, broth(esp.prepared from split
    or ground pease &c with roots and salt)MBh.R.Sus3r.&c

(where Un2 refers to उणादि-सूत्र) and [√3. सु](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1219-sImantaya.jpg)is the one that is the root of सुनोति‌ etc.

  

But [Apte has](http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.6:1:2214.apte):

सूपः \[सुखेन पीयते, सु-पा घञर्थे क पृषो˚ Tv.\]**1**Broth, soup; सूपं भूयिष्ठमन्नीष्वं नाद्य मांसं यथा पूरा Mb.12.29.128; न स जानाति शास्त्रार्थं दवीं सूपरसानिव Subhāṣ.; Ms.3.226.**-2**A sauce, condiment; पच्यन्तां विविधाः पाकाः सूपान्ताः पायसादयः Bhāg.1.24.26;11.27.34.**-3**A cook.**-4**A pan, vessel.**-5**An arrow.**-6**Split pease.**-Comp. -अङ्गम्**asa-foetida.**-कारः**a cook.**-धूपनम्, -धूपकम्**asa-foetida.**-श्रेष्ठः**The*mudga*bean.

(where "Tv." refers to Tārānatha's Vācaspatyam).

  

  

  

For the English word, we can look at the Online Etymology Dictionary, [which has](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=soup):

[soup (n.)](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=soup&allowed_in_frame=0)[![Look up soup at Dictionary.com](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rqdP5E12C9u4rSuNxdfOH2M9lSCDhVNxJRyJCVdBOsxxvWVcmGRpEKzNtOM1U4OVr1xk_HJ5q_nRtQ0k_a4IAb2wH2Y=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.etymonline.com/graphics/dictionary.gif "Look up soup at Dictionary.com")](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=soup "Look up soup at Dictionary.com")  
"liquid food," 1650s, from Frenchsoupe"soup, broth" (13c.), from Late Latinsuppa"bread soaked in broth," from a Germanic source (compare Middle Dutchsop"sop, broth"), from Proto-Germanic\*sup-, from PIE\*sub-, from root\*seue-(2) "to take liquid" (see[sup](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sup&allowed_in_frame=0)(v.2)).  

which leads to:  

[sup (v.2)](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sup&allowed_in_frame=0)[![Look up sup at Dictionary.com](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rqdP5E12C9u4rSuNxdfOH2M9lSCDhVNxJRyJCVdBOsxxvWVcmGRpEKzNtOM1U4OVr1xk_HJ5q_nRtQ0k_a4IAb2wH2Y=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.etymonline.com/graphics/dictionary.gif "Look up sup at Dictionary.com")](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sup "Look up sup at Dictionary.com")  
"to sip, to take into the mouth with the lips," Old Englishsupan(West Saxon),suppan,supian(Northumbrian) "to sip, taste, drink, swallow" (strong verb, past tenseseap, past participlesopen), from Proto-Germanic\*supanan(cognates: Old Norsesupa"to sip, drink," Middle Low Germansupen, Dutchzuipen"to drink, tipple," Old High Germansufan, Germansaufen"to drink, booze"), from PIE\*sub-, possibly an extended form of root\*seue-(2) "to take liquid" (cognates: Sanskritsunoti"presses out juice,"soma; Avestanhaoma, Persianhom"juice;" Greekhuetos"rain,"huein"to rain;" Latinsugere"to suck,"succus"juice, sap;" Lithuaniansula"flowing sap;" Old Church Slavonicsoku"sap,"susati"suck;" Middle Irishsuth"sap;" Old Englishseaw"sap").

So the English word "soup" definitely has cognates ("सुनोति" etc.) in Sanskrit, but‌ whether it is related to "सूपः"‌ or not depends on whether you believe the (quoted in M-W) उणादि-सूत्र's derivation that सूपः‌ is from √सु , or Apte's quoted derivation from something else.

  

In this particular case I'm inclined to believe the former derivation, so that

**the English word "soup" is indeed related to Sanskrit "सूपः".  
**
