Namaste,



In bAla-kANDa of vAlmiki rAmAyaNa (vide 1.53.3), sage vashiSTa prays kAmadhEnu for offering various delicacies to sage vishwAmitra. Vide range of delicacies are mentioned as:



uSNa ADasya Odanasya api rAshayaH parvatOpamAH

mruSTa annAni cha sUpAH cha dadhi kulyAH tathaiva cha ...1.53.3



The above sloka implies several food items like rice, desserts, milk & ghee products and various other items related to shaD-ruchi were served. There is one interesting word here which drew my attention ie., "sUpAH" which implies ***dal*** prepared with pulses.



Is theenglish word "Soup" a derivative of this sanskrit word "sUpaH" ?



regs,

sriram
