I can't understand your doubt.

  

It will be translated as the Vega of उदर and उपस्थ. You can rely on the interpretation of the commentator which is legitimate. And not as you have suggested the interpretation. "The rule is द्वन्द्वान्तेश्रूयामाणं पदं प्रत्येकमभिसन्धत्ते।" which is the guide line for the above explanation by commentators. Yet I fail understand your question and reason for your interpretation..

वाचो वेगं, मनसः क्रोधवेगं,

जिह्वावेगमुदरोपस्थवेगम्,

एतान् *वेगान्* यो विषहेत धीरः

सर्वामपीमं पृथिवीं स शिष्यात् ॥१॥

  

The underlined is the correction. The relation of the first half and the second is somewhat requiring from the commentary. The term Vega is a medical term, generally denoting the urges of the body listed above.
