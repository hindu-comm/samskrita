There is a reference to this lullaby In Sw. Sivananda's article as below:  

  

[www.dlshq.org/download/liberation.pdf](http://www.dlshq.org/download/liberation.pdf)  
  
The queen Madalasa rocked the cradles of her infant princes and sang this lullaby: “You are all-pure, enlightened and immaculate. Give up this sleep of delusion which makes you give value to that which has no value, to endow it with a sense of reality through ignorance. This is a great blunder. This is the darkness of the slumber of non-awareness.”

शुद्धोऽसि बुद्धोऽसि निरंजनोऽसि  
संसारमाया परिवर्जितोऽसि।  
संसारस्वप्नं त्यज मोहनिद्रां  
मदालसोल्लपमुवाच पुत्रम्।।  
Would someone have the exact location of this verse in some scripture?  
Thanks.
