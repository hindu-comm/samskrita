The verses in the att. file - Ch. 25 #10-19, and Ch. 26 #34-39 (part 2 in the collection), seem to be the 'lullabies'. Would this be a fair conclusion? Thanks.

According to the website<http://stdin.tumblr.com/post/35496696969/thus-spoke-madalasa-i>, the source of the verse is the Madalasa story in Markandeya Purana,
According to the website<http://hinduonline.co/Scriptures/Puranas/MarkandeyaPurana.html> this story starts from 1.4.4. The story of Madalasa and the advice given by her to her son is available from printed page 81 onwards in the abridged Hindi translation of Markandeya Purana at the website<https://archive.org/details/MarkandeyaPuranGitapress>. This translation cites a few of the oroginal Sanskrit verses but unfortunately the verse quoted above is not reproduced there.

  

I could not locate a Sanskrit text of the Purana despite efforts.
