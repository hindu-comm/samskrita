Thanks very much Sunder for sending these further links and attachments.
Most of the lullabies/songs seem to be modern, apart from the verses in the Markandeya Purana. Does anyone know of any other references to lullabies in pre-modern Sanskrit literature? I am interested because if there were lullabies in Sanskrit it could indicate that some children at least did learn Sanskrit as a mother tongue (perhaps one of several mother tongues).
