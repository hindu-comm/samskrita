Namaste,

  

In Brahmanda Purana (vide Alarka Charita (8th chapter) of dattAtrEya mahAtmya, there are 9 slokas. All 9 slokas are pregnant with vedanta rahasyas. Madalasa gives birth to 4 sons viz., vikrAnta, subAhu, shatrumardana, Alarka.

  

Madalasa, with her lullabies, make her three sons (vikrAnta, subAhu, shatrumardana) viraktAs and make them tread the path of nivrutti mArga.
While she was about to sing lullaby for her 4th son Alarka, her husband admonishes her saying that if all their 4 children take to sanyasa, there would not be any one to choose grihastha dharma. So, 4th son was imparted both jnAna mArga and karma mArga who later got initiated into yOga-rahasyAs from Dattatreya.

  

So, all the 4 sons were imparted vedanta jnAna with 4 types of lullabies. However, i have only one which was imparted to 1st son ie., vikrAnta.

  

When time permits, post those 9 verses.

  

regs,

sriram
