[TABLE]

  
Griffith translation (The hard copy has a footnote to this as being a lullaby).

  
2 When, O bright Son of Saramā, thou showest, tawny-hued! thy teeth,  
They gleam like lances' points within thy mouth when thou wouldst bite; go thou to sleep.  
3 Saramā's Son, retrace thy way: bark at the robber and the thief.  
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dust thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep.  
4 Be on thy guard against the boar, and let the boar beware of thee.  
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dost thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep.  
5 Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog and master of the house.
