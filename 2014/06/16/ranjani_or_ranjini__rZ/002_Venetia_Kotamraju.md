Namaste Sai Mahodaya,

This came up when we were translating the Madhura Vijaya (it appears it 1.19 of that work). The commentator writes:

विद्वज्जनान् रञ्जयितुम् आह्लादयितुम् शीलमस्या इति विद्वज्जनरञ्जिनी पण्डितजनाह्लदजननी । हेतुमण्ण्यन्ताद्रञ्जेः ’सुप्यजातौ’ इति णिनिः ।

Monier Williams indicates both forms are acceptable but my colleague Dr Shankar felt that ranjani is definitely better.

Best,

Venetia
