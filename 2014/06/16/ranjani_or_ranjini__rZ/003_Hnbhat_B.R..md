As singular word, Dr. Shankar is correct. The above commentary, relates to the form in compound, as the rule quoted makes it clear. The suffix णिनि needs another सुबन्त, and could not stand alone by itself.

  

The isolated usage, if found any, derived from रञ्जनः, रञ्जना, रञ्जनी and least possible form is रञ्जिनी. with the same suffix.
