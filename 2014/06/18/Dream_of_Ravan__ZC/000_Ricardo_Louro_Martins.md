Dear all,

  

I came across a text published in the Dublin University Magazine, between 1853 and 54, called "The Dream of Ravan", by an anonymous author. The author says the english text is made of fragments of an ancient indian one with the same title, maybe in sanskrit, although the autor uses much of marathi. I would like to ask, if you please, for your help, if you know the original text and where i can find it.

  

Many thanks in advance!

Regards,

Ricardo Martins
