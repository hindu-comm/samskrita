Thank you very much for satisfying my curiosity. I spent a whole day and read the whole book! I did enjoy the expressive beauty of the language and the imagery, in the beginning passages. Later I got a little confused. The author couldn't be an Indian who actually had read Valmiki! Mariichi was killed long before the war started and Indrajit was killed much later in the war. Never heard of Ravana's armies singing Bhajans of Krisha!! (a totally ridiculous explanation is offered for this!) Lots of things appear even worse than ridiculous! The author is in good company with those ridiculous Christians who claim Valluvar was Xavier's disciple!
