I browsed through the book, "Dream of Ravan" after downloading.In my view the author is an Englishman who has created a fictional ( all his own around known story of Ramayana) work to express his understanding of Vedantic philosophy. He quotes a bit of Adhyatma Ramayana and a bit of Gita too. The work is not a translation. Even the passages which are purportedly translations are a part of author's fertile imagination.

Murthy
