Every human being capable of taking his own decision is free to recite Veda-s, perform Vedic rites, though Shastra-s prescribe Vedadhyayana and Vedadhyapana, as the obligatory duty for Brahmins and Vedadhyayana for all three Varna-s, for a time where Varnashrama-dharma-s were created and followed. Now in a democratic society, every one with the faculty of speech and act, is free to act upon his will and pleasure and why to put the blame on shastra's, SmRiti's and Veda's followed by Brahmins?

  

  

I agree with Srivathsa it is the shortcut to blame those Brahmins to become Scholars .
