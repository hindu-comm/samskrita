Even Gita cautions thus:  
shrutivipratipannA te yadA sthAsyati nishchalA .  

samAdhAvachalA buddhistadA yogamavApsyasi .. 2\\-53..

  

"You will win this supreme Yoga when your intellect, bewildered by Vedic texts, becomes firm and unwavering in concentration".

  

The Teacher-Disciple (Guru-Shishya) relationship is unique and only the Teacher (Sadguru) can judge the readiness, qualifications and need of the student to follow a particular mode of life.
