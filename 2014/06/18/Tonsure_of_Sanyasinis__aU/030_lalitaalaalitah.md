bhAShya of bhagavatpAda is correct and is well explained by madhusUdana sarasvatI.  
But that is not supporting translations presented by you .  
  
nistraiguNya vAkyam can not be correct for the apparent meaning you wish to propagate because nistraiguNya brahman is also known through them. So gItA is not derogatory towards veda while your translations do so.  
  
bhagavatpAda holds that in lack of kAma there can not be vaidika or laukika karma except those which are essential for holding body. This charity work is not going to happen for niShkAma person. If you say that such person can do these things as kartavya then please note that kartavya for such person according to shAstra is tyAga, shama, dama, shravaNa, manana, etc. and not taking of money from others and channeling it to charity works and then taking all credits for those.  
  
upadexyanti vAkyam is also not derogatory towards veda and it does not say that Guru can decide anything for shiShya without caring shAstra.  
  
And for your personal comment towards me, my reply will be similar to what I posted one on advaitin yahoo group while opposing such a missionary :  
As You feel hurt because I refute a person, who is revered for you even when he does not support shAstra, so I feel hurt when these people write and do anything opposed to shAstra. I think there deed is unholy and mine is just opposed to famous people.  
  
The problem is that people care what benefits them and then call it correct and even shAstrIya. What these missionaries are doing is good for people and hence they think that this must be according to shAstra.  
The condition is so worse that a even a tyAgI mahAtmA is asked by people to do such work and hence forced to pravRtti.  
They clearly proclaim that if a sannyAsI is not doing these things, he is useless parasite and should not take sannyAsa.  
This is the way these neo traditions abuse original one by partially adopting our shAstra, procedures, clothes, etc.
