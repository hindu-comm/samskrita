For me there are two types of people interested in Shastra-s and Veda-s. Who want to follow them in faith and others who want to find fault in them with their knowledge of Sanskrit and raise questions in terms of present day stream of thinking without the knowledge of working of Shastra's and scripture.

  

The Shastra, in its own, terms, could be interpreted traditionally. Vidhi, Niyama, Nishedha, Vipratishedha, etc. Without following the method of interpretation of Veda-s and Shastra-s, it is difficult to follow the intention of the Shastra's and Veda's Vidhi, Niyama, Gunavada, which is absent in normal logical discussion in present day discussion.
