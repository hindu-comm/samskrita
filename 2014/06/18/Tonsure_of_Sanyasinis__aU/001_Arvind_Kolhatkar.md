Ramesh,

  

Are you sure thatसंन्यास for women is prescribed or even contemplated in any text?  If so, could you cite a reference?

  

In this connection, I had a quick look at Adhyaaya 6 of Manusmriti. It talks of Vanaprastha and Sanyaasa only for a man. A woman taking Sanyaasa is not contemplated there.

  

I am aware that there are several instances of women ascetics in old literature. I would think that those were cases of women voluntarily taking up the ascetic way of life, without formal rules, such as were prescribed for men.
