Just replace CANNOT with "NEED NOT". Every other thing is fine- in place sir.

Women are very different from men in many respects. So their life course follows a different pattern and their ways to grow, realize and practice are entirely different than men. Even if she undergoes some penance-ritual-related issues, it will be only a formality. Her ways are more innerand subtlerthan outward. Well- that will raise another debate. (Just making an "इति दिक्" kind of statement.)

But may be answers to such questions as asked by you are in stopping to compare the two genders on strict stern grounds.  

Not much authoritative to talk on the topic. Just expressing what I felt as a woman myself.

Thankyou.
