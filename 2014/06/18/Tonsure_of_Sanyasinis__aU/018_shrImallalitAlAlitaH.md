Are they traditionally following veda-s, shAstra-s ?  
I don't see any trait.  
  
And keeping such people in mind, you ask us to answer according to shAstra-s ?  
  
Get your idea clear about difference of traditional/shAstrIya saMpradAya-s and these neo-traditions which accept any part of any books which suits them and neglect all else.

If you are using such language and posting it to your website, it is clear that you have no inclination to paraMparA, then why are you trying to find solution from shAstra-s ?

Thank you for revealing your thoughts.  
Better express it in first post and don't bother sAMpradAyika-s by posing yourself well wisher and faithful of shAstra-s.  
  
It is clear that there are two types of people now who have faith in shAstra-s :  
1. Those who are following traditional path and regard chAturvarNya  
2. Those who respect shAstra-s in parts, because some Hindu-Missionaries have propagated them.  
  
Second type of people don't study the shAstra in whole and don't think it essential to support every part of the shAstra. Such people can not claim to be following shAstra-s, because as soon as undesired part comes in question, they shun shAstra and confront it.  
You can only be said follower of a shAstra, if you could accept the whole as pramANa. Otherwise, you are just following wish and branding it shAstrIya to blame them in future again.  
We traditional people fear such persons coming in garb of shAstrIya person because they are harming us from inside.
