I think the question is already discussed in another thread. whether Maitrayani, Katyayini, Yajnavalki by their names, found in Upanishads are to be called rishi or Rishini/s? In other words what they are called with the same idea. In this case he is under the impression, that they are sanyasin-s or sanyasini's as they participate in the discussions on BrahmaJnana, as we find on the examples of Janaka - Sulabha, etc.

  

There are instances of Bauddha Bhikshini's, independently, taking Diksha, as we can see in the stories of Bauddha's and there are women as head of Jain Monasteries. even today. I am not sure there is any such practice in Shastra's to take up sanyasa, by women, though there are instances of Amritanandamayi, treated as Guru and there may be many women disciplines of her preaching knowlege. Here you can collect how she became a guru-mata:

Except this there may be many other Mata-s, imparting knowledges, of which I am not sure. It seems the question is like the one whether women are entitled to learn Veda-s or Brahmajnana, frequently discussed in this forum once and in other forums. Such discussions cite only examples of some exemplaries and do not site anything from Sahastrra to support or with a view of discretion towares women in Hindu culture, like the one issue of Manu, saying न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति, if any quoted.
