Ramesh,

  

You ask, "As a follower of Shastra one is bound to quote the relevant portion. Isn't it? Or should we run away from them, keeping silent.>

  

My answer to the first question is: You cannot, because the so-called 'relevant portion' does not exist.

  

As to the second question, there is no need to run away from the query.
You can patiently explain why the 'relevant portion' does not exist.
The traditional Indian Society of olden times, in which the shastras and the smritis were being written, was, whether today we like it not, a male-oriented society. The role allotted to the females in it was that of running the household and bringing up children. Even women themselves were quite willing to confine themselves to these areas only.
There is no need to feel apologetic about it, the whole world ran like this!

  

On this background, how many women would want to take up sanyaasa? And if there were not many, how would the need arise to frame rules to govern their sanyaasa?

  

That is why such rules or prescriptions do not exist. Despite that, if an exceptional woman did want to give up worldly life and voluntarily become an ascetic, she could do so. There was no bar to it.
