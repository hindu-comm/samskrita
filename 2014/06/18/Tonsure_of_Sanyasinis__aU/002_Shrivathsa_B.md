hariH OM,  
  
 If the woman has tiivra vairAgya, there is no need for her to take up sannyAsa (in the formal way). There have been instances of such women in history who didn't take up formal sannyAsa (may be because of their respect for shAstra).  
  

 A vAnaprasthi is called a "shmashru" (literally, a moustache). After virajA homa (the shAstric prescription for a person wanting to take up sannyAsa), he has to shave his head and his beard and moustache (shmashru). In case we want to call it a traditional sannyAsa, there is no way by which a woman can undergo this.  
  
 There is also a more repugnant point here: A sannyAsi is supposed to not even look at or talk to a woman even when she is clothed. This being the case, after virajA homa, the next day (day of sannyAsa grahaNa) the person taking sannyAsa has to go to a nearby river and do a snAna and cast off even "his" clothes (the sign of sarvasva tyAga) and wear the clothes given by his guru (ochre). When a person giving the sannyAsa is a sannyAsi himself, how is he to look at a naked woman or give her clothes? Hence, any sannyAsi willing to maintain his sannyAsa will not even contemplate these "innovations".  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
