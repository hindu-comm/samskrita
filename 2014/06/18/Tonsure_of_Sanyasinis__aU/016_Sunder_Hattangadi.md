[TABLE]

  

"  
In practical contemporary terms, there are quite a few examples of women  
who have been invested with the external symbols of saMnyAsa by some of  
the most orthodox and learned leaders of the vedAnta traditions. There is no  
hard and fast rule that can be cited in opposition to this.
