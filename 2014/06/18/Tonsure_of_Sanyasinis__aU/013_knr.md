Hari Om,

Let me make myself very clear here. Ms.Savita Acharya is not my informant nor am I an ardent follower of Arya samaj /Dayanand Saraswati / the so called renaissance -social reformers who break the time proven rules & rituals .

I am not in search of quick fix answers, rather I am in search of detailed answers having their foundations centred on srutis & smritis.

But these are the questions which I often confront from these type of so called anti-brahmin people in the name of social reformers, for which I have no strong answers. Hence I sought the help of the scholars in this group to support our rituals & brahmins.

I do not even have an iota of intention to demean our rituals, srutis, smritis or brahmins or any individuals in particular here.

  

Now coming to the question raised can it be concluded that women CANNOT take up Sanyasa as per sastras & hence question of tonsure doesnt raise at all.

  

namaskarams
