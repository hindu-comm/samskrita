hariH OM,  
Mr. Ramesh,  
  

 The comments I had made about your informant (Ms. Savita Acharya) were general. I had loathed to listen to her in the video (given her views as expressed by you), but listened nonetheless in view of fairness (to give her views an honest and dispassionate hearing). The following are some points about the video. You are free to choose her as your informant, but do so with a clear understanding that much of her views appear mutually contradictory, misinformed and hazy. Her intentions seem alright, but her approach seems very misguided and prone to produce more rancor than peace.  
  

Observations:  

1\. the vedic texts which were there till mahAbhArata time were lost in the medieval times and it is dayAnanda sarasvati who got them from Germany and showed us that those were the Vedas!!! Seems like either Mr. Dayananda Saraswati or Ms. Savita Acharya didn't / don't know about the oral tradition. (this, inspite of her talking about aShTavikR^iti pAThAH).  
  

2\. She also talks about R^iShi R^iNam ... so she is suggesting R^iNa towards the German R^iShis??? (the Vedas were anyway lost to us no?)  
  

3\. Women have lot of strength, and it is for this reason that medieval brahmins didn't want them to "come up", it is with this fear that they denied them Veda. One is at a loss to understand this: Ms. Savita Acharya who claim that there were gArgii vAcaknavii etc. in the ancient period who used to "recite" vedas. So, the "fear among men that women will come up" was only a medieval thing. Ancient brahmin men were either dullheads or lazy, or were so full of compassion! Moreover, the women who had so much power, hadn't "come up" till the medieval times, and went down because of brahmin men suppressing them!!!  

  

3\. Ms. AcArya makes a baseless claim to the effect that there were injunctions for molten lead to be poured into the ears of women who listen to Veda. This comment is unsubstantiated, scurrilous and irresponsible.  
  

4\. Ms. AcArya first says, the Veda is for all. Then she says, there is a shAstra niyama which says women have to be taught by women, and men by men. One can easily interpolate (in her style) and say that this niyama was made by those irritating old blokes (old brahmin men?) who wanted to keep men and women away from each other. This was because they wanted the "powerful" women to remain powerful and not share their power with men :-)  
  

5\. A person who claims to have learnt mahAbhAShya, nirukta etc. pronounces j\~nAna as jyAna, R^iShi as ruShi, saMrAj\~nii as saMrAjii. One may assume this to be too personal an attack, but this is a person who makes claims about our history, tradition etc. without even pronouncing j\~nAna properly. Is this not tragic?  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
