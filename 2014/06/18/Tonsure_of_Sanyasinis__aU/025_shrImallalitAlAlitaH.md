Ask them to support parts of shAstra with which they aren't easy.  
They will try to escape or torture text.  
At that point, point conflict of another part of shAstra with their view.  
And, so on.  
  
Any explanation, either given by them or us, is to be tested in the same way.

First of all, make clear what is sannyAsa.  
If shunning kAma, krodha, lobha, moha, etc., then all can do it.  
If shunning home and going to some Hindu Mission to live according to them, even then we are not opposing.  
  
What we are opposing is the chaturtha-AshArama which is taken as a vow with shrAddha, prAjApatyeShTi and virajA homa, etc. to shun vaidika-karma and upAsanA which was ordained by veda-s to achieve everything from svarga to brahmaloka.  
  
Now, as there is no prApti of vaidika-karma for strI-shUdra-s, there is no need to bar it.  
  
Although, I've explained why there is no text to bar sannyAsa of strI and shUdra, I'll go further and say:  
If 'absence of negation of sannyAsa of strI-shUdra-s' results in 'vidhi of same for them', then animals, as dog, cow, etc., and non-sentient things, such as pot, hut, etc., will become eligible for sannyAsa.  
So, if you make a rule 'everything not enjoined by shAstra should be clearly mentioned', then just to say that humans are adhikArI of science you should fill whole book with negation of atoms, protons, pot, hut, dog, etc.  
So, सर्वं वाक्यं सावधारणम् - rule will hold good here, i.e. every sentence is decisive unless said otherwise. In this case, the sannyAsa-vAkya for AshramI-s decides sannyAsa of them only barring same of everything and everyone else.

Once we negate sannyAsa of others, this will be negated.  
BTW, anything independent of shAstra could be done by strI-shUdra-s to look alike shAstrIya-s to deceive people or for just imitating. We can't stop this. This is duty of rAjA, not us.  
shiShTa-s can only keep themselves away from such people to stop delusion of common people.

No, we will reply. But, for any debate both parties need to be educated and accepting shAstra-prAmANya.  
If they just start telling that these vidhi-s and shAstra-s are created by lustful brAhmaNa-s, the validity of shAstra gets destroyed, and hence they are just like nAstika-s, christians and muslims for us. We have to then ask them why they want to take sannyAsa according to shAstra-s of such biased people ? If they tell that only portion was added by us, then ask them how did they decide ? The same logic which paints us as bad, will hold good against them and their interpretation too.
