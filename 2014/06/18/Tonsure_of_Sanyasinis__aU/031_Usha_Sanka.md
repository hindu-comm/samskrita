Namaste

Indeed. Very well put. It is not "truth-centered thinking" that is valid, but "person-centered", that leads to such minconceptions.

Sanyasis have no such intentions. Please do not say such things for traditional sanyasis, sir. It will lead to more damage of personal self (on standards of dharma; (shastra has prohibited it)). Restrained from it, better.
