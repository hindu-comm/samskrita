If you are talking of shAstra, which I hope is veda and smR^iti, then there is no sannyAsa-vidhi for women, because they are not karmAdhikAriNI.  
sannyAsa according to shAstra is for those kramAdhikArin-s who become virakta.  
If a women has virakti, she can take mental sannyAsa which includes shunning of kAmya-karma, their fruit, desires, etc.  
  
However, we also get janaka-sulabhA saMvAda, which may hint at vairAgya of women. But, we will have to search for vidhi of sannyAsa to support that. As it is not supported by tradition, shAstra-s and mImAMsA, the word 'bhixukI' used for her will not prove her a sannyAsinI who has shunned through homa, etc.  
  
Anyway, let us not go to details of adhikAra. It was thought upon on another forum and we could not decide in favor.  
The present tradition of vaidika-s doesn't allow sannyAsa to be taken through virajA-homa by ladies.
