There is nothing to be hurt, if one presents a view of some writer, and the other prefers the view of another. But only personal remarks on another writer or member would certainly hurt the other and this personal addressing is best avoided in a conversation in any forum. That is the ideal discussion without addressing the opinion with any personal remark.

  

As for Gita, there are too many commentaries and translations and if one gives a translation, that is fine and the other can give the opinion of the other writer or translator or commentator. Here is the Gita Website which includes many English translations, commentaries in English and Sanskrit if any one is interested in Gita.

The above remark is an perverted remark, generally pointed against a class of people, and such remarks are best to be avoided.

  

And in the case of the point in discussion, on the verse cited, the word can be differently interpreted, and the readers are free to read the favorite translation and commentaries from the above cite itself.

  

वि+प्रतिपत्तिः - The difference of interpretations lie in the shades of meaning for the prefix, and each commentator and translator is free to comment on the aspect favorable to his ideology. So it is natural to have difference of opinions in the meaning of such words.

  

विविधा, विरुद्धा, विशिष्टा, all the some of the ways among the many possible meanings for the prefix वि। Generally it means different opinion or difference opinion. and the the adjective also विप्रतिपन्ना would mean विविद्धं विरुद्धं विशिष्टं and the like.

  

  

Better to avoid such remarks pointed towards willingly/unwillingly against other members or a section of the society in general in a general discussion.
