Do you think that quoting people who are famous, will make it shAstrIya.  
These people are 'famous', not 'shiShTa-s', so their fame is not going to make their doings correct.  
  
And, the wrong notion, that sannyAsa is taken to serve world by making hospital, etc., which is popularized by Ramakrishna Mission and followed by many, is also wrong. This is notion is against shAstra. sannyAsa is not ordained for this purpose.  
  
BTW, don't take it as if I'm opposing good works by them. They are doing good work by making hospital, etc., but this is not for which sannyAsa is ordained by shAstra. ऋणानि त्रीनपाकृत्य मनो मोक्षे निवेशयेत् . They are in previous stage of sannyAsa, provided they are AshramI-s and varNI-s.  
So, their sannyAsa is just a way to differentiate those who are faithful to them. They just have devised a way to do this by giving sannyAsa as said in shAstra-s, although without thinking about adhikAra, etc.  
We have no problem if they declare it.  
The problem occurs because they name it sannyAsa and do same procedures as we do, and then common people thinks that this is the same sannyAsa which is said in shAstra-s and these people are faithful to shAstra-s.**
