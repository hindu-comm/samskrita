The translation is wrong, at least from advaita point of view. See madhUsUdana-sarasvatI-s TIkA:  
ते तव बुद्धिः **श्रुतिभिर्नानाविधफलश्रवणैरविचारिततात्पर्यैर्विप्रतिपन्ना अनेकविधसंशयविपर्यासवत्त्वेन विक्षिप्ता** प्राक्, यदा यस्मिन्काले शुद्धिजविवेकजनितेन दोषदर्शनेन तं विक्षेपं परित्यज्य **समाधौ परमात्मनि** निश्चला जाग्रत्स्वप्नदर्शनलक्षणविक्षेपरहिता, अचला सुषुप्तिमूर्च्छास्तब्धीभावादिरूपलयलक्षणचलनरहिता सती स्थास्यति।  
  
Note that अविचारिततात्पर्य्या श्रुतिरेव विप्रतिपत्तिं जनयति , न तु श्रुतिरेव । अविचारश्च पुरुषस्येति पुरुषस्यैव दुष्टतात्रोक्ता , न शास्त्रस्य ।  
  
And,  
Apparently, your quote tries to say that veda-s create delusion and hence should be shunned and you must concentrate/meditate. This goes well with bauddha-matam.  
We vaidika-s don't accept that, dharma-adharma can be known by meditation.  
  
So, your quote translation and next comment is helping delusion to grow.  
If you have time, please try to elaborate your views clearly. For now, I'm replying what it appears to people.  
  
In your whole post you are just appearing, if not doing willingly, to derogate shAstra-s.  
  
And, if you are willingly doing it, better announce it in clear words, so that we could reply clearly.

Was it said in gItA verse you quoted ?  
Then from where did you bring this conclusion ?  
Do you mean that those guru-s who don't study shAstra-s, and those students, who don't care what shAstra is, are enough to decide what dharma is and what is adharma irrespective of shAstra-s ?  
  
The above sentence is mirror of what tAntrika-s say whenever one points deviation from shAstra in their tradition. It is just a mean to fool yourself if no valid shAstra is available to support and guru is not shiShTa.  
Neo-vedAntin-s and Hindu-Missionaries are using this sentence to make fool of people and keep them in ignorance, just to grow faith in them.
