hariH OM,  

shrii KNR,  
  

 Thanks for the clarification. taking up sannyAsa is a rare privilege indeed. even if one aspires, one may not get it in one's lifetime (total digression from the topic, but relevant nonetheless). Secondly digression: virakti is all important, it can be there in women as well as men. Any woman who has tiivra virakti will live like miira bai, etc. and will not wantonly violate paramparA.  
  

 In view of practical limitations, and lack of shAstric injunctions, it seems impossible for women to take up sannyAsa.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
