I will the put the question the other way...

How to confront if a person from non-follower of shastra asks a traditional follower this type of questions, such as, "Where is it mentioned in Sastras that women cannot take up sannyas? Where is it told that tonsure is only for male sanyasis?" and other similar questions. As a follower of Shastra one is bound to quote the relavant portion. Isn't it? Or should we run away from them, keeping silent.
