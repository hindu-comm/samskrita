Ha, right, the brahmins created this. After creating this, they lived poor, got butchered and raped by each and every invader, all because they wanted to prevent the women and shudras from reciting vedas. Not even a word of praise for the miserable brahmin who upheld the best this land had to offer all through the centuries of tribulation!!! How banal and childish can this get? This seems the ticket to the fastest train which can take you to the glory land. Abuse the brahmins and be sure that you will achieve glory!  
  

Our scholar seems to be in search of quick fix answers to questions troubling him. Good luck to him. But I wish to ask of the scholar, if he had such quick fix answers, why did he ask a question at all? Why not blame the denial of Sannyasa to women as a thing created by brahmins and go to sleep?
