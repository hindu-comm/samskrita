The intention of me raising this question was after seeing the sanyasinis of Jaggi Vasudev, whereas the Sanyasinis of Nithyananda group including Nithyananda do not tonsure.

  

Coming to whether vedas can be cited by women request you to visit these links:

Though this video is in telugu, the acharyani says there is no harm in chanting vedas by women and these are all created by Brahmins at a later stage.

Thanks a lot to all of you who have answered my queries.
