As Taff & Bhat sir has pointed out these have been dug out from yahoo groups.

  

I shall go with Arvind Kolhatkar Mahodaya's view.

I went through Manu smriti fastlyfrom

<http://www.scribd.com/doc/7189037/Manu-Smriti-Sanskrit-Text-With-English-Translation>

  

and could only find 9.65 which says

नउद्वाहिके षु मन्त्रेषु नियोग: कीर्त्यते क्वचित् \| न विवाहविधाव् उं विधवावेदनम् पुन: \|\|

In the sacred texts which refer to marriage the appointment (of widows) is nowhere mentioned, nor is there-marriage of widows prescribed in the rules concerning marriage.

  

I could not locate the verses cited.

  

Thanks a lot Arvind Kolhatkar Mahoday.
