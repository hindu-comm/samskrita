Namaste,

  

There are typical folk tales associated with matsyendranatha and gorakhnatha.

  

Even though, matsyendranatha (minanatha) was the guru of gorakh, the former forgets his true self and become "mArga-bhraSTa" owing to indulgence in sensual pleasure since he was associated with women in kAmarUpa kshEtra. This was a great tAntrika shAkta kshEtra and the shakti worship was conducted with kaula & vAma paddhati. Matsyendranatha, owing to his close association with tAntrika yoginis of this place, wrote a shAkta work on the practice of kaula & vAma rituals called "kauLavaLi-nirNaya" which details out the practice of kAmAkhya devi with vAmachAra and kaula paddhati.

  

When he became a yOga-bhraSTa, his disciple Sri Gorakhnatha, in search of his guru, happens to visit this place. Since, this place was inhabited by women only, he disguises himself as a yogini stri and enters the hall where his guru matsyendranatha was present among women.
A dance was arranged and when a vEshya-stri by name kaLinga was dancing, shri gorakhnatha was playing tabla to the tune and started singing "jAg macchandar gOrakh AyA". The meaning of this is "O my beloved guru matsyendranatha ! awake from your deep slumber; regain your lost consciousness; recollect your lost glory ! Look your beloved disciple gorakh has come". When the song was over, shri minanatha regained his lost glory and vairAgya dawned upon him.

  

This is the legend behind that song.
