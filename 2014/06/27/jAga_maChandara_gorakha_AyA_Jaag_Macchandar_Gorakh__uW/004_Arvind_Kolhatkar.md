At<https://ia600407.us.archive.org/6/items/StoriesOfIndianSaints-JustinEAbbotVol1/StoriesOfIndianSaints-JustinEAbbotVol1.pdf> is a book called 'Stories of Indian Saints', translated and edited by Dr Justin Abbott and NR Godbole, (apparently) first published in 1931.
This is a translation from Marathi of the well-known 'Bhaktavijaya', a collection of biographies of saints, compiled in the 18th century by Mahipatibua Taharabadkar (1715-1790).

  

From pp 338 to 376 of this book is are the life-stories of Matyendranath and his disciple Gorakhanath, follows by a recital of the 'Guruparampara' from Gorakhanath to Jnaneshvar, who wrote two celebrated works 'Jnaneshvari' and 'Amritanubhava'. (It is well-known that Jnaneshvar considered himself as belonging to the Nathapantha.

  

The account given by Mahipatibua of Matsyendranath and Gorakhanath does not mention the story of Matsyendranath going away from the life of Sanyaasa and Gorakhnath bringing him back to the right path.
