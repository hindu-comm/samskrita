On searching the title,I came across a bhojpuri film under the similar title and could not find any novel and its author.

  

Searching "Jaag Machinder Gorakh Aaya " I came to the details of the story writer etc. of the film:

  

<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bhojpuri/movies/news-interviews/Jaag-Machinder-Gorakh-Aaya-to-release-soon/articleshow/18099124.cms>  

  

and also VCD-s are available. The title song is also is seen in albums of mp3 audio.

  

But no book or its author is seen in the site of biodata on Matsendranatha:
