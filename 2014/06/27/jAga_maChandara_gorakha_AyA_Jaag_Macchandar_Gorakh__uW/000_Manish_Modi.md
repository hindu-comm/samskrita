Dear friends,

namonamaH

  

Encouraged by the fine response my earlier inquiry raised, I am making another inquiry.

  

A novelised biography was written on the life of Matsyendranath, the disciple of GorakshanathaGorakhnath. For the life of me, I cannot recall who wrote this novelised biography but it was well written enough to bear comparison with Shivaji Savant's 'Mrityunjaya'. I remember clearly that it was called 'Jaag Macchandar Gorakh Aayaa'.

  

जाग मछन्दर गोरख आया

  

Can anyone help me procure a copy? I prefer buying a physical copy, but even a pdf will do. I can print it out.

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
