It is clear that Mr. Modi believes, the above is the title of a biography written, and he wants a physical book or a pdf copy of it and not of any other book on biography of Matsendranatha or a derivation of the words in the title or his name.

  

He does know the biography, and was sure Matsyendranath was the discipline of Gorakshanath.

  

This is just to focus on the question raised.
