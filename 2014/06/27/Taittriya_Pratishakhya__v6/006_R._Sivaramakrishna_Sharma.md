Namaste,  
  
Thank you very much for providing the links from DLI. I have all except for the Telugu Book, which I intend to download soon. Regarding your query on the Madras University' book, I do not remember the DLI number, but I have uploaded a "scan-fixed" version of the book; the link is below.
