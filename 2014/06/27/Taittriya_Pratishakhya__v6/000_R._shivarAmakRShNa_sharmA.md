Namaste All,  
  
I would be glad if any one could point out downloadable PDFs of Taittriya-pratishakhya with Tribhashyaratna and/or Vaidikabharanam in either Nagari, Telugu or Grantha scripts.  

  

I have the copy of Whitney's edition but unfotunately reading Samskritam in Roman is not very "pleasing" and generally only a fall-back. I also have te Padakamanusandana Vyakhya of Mahisheya which I downloaded from DLI.  
  
Thank you.  
  

Regards,
