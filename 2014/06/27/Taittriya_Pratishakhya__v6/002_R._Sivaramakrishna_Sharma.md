Namaste All,  
  
After much searching on Google, Archive.org and DLI, I was able to get (possibly) all editions on the Internet viz. Vaidikabharanam and Tribhashya Ratnam published as #33 of Bibliotheca Indica (Governement Oriental Series, Mysore), One with Padakramanusandana by Mahisheya published by Madras University in 1930, the Tribhashya Ratna with Whitney's translation and the first printed form of the work ed. by Rajendra Mitra Lala,  
  
I will soon upload these to some place and notify, in case other Vaidikas may need it.  
  
Thank you.
