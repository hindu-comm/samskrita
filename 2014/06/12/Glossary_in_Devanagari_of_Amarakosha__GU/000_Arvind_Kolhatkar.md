Dear Group,

  

Locating a specific word in Amarakosha was, at least for me, a tedious process so far. To make this task easy, I enclose as a Notepad Document, a glossary of all words in Amarakosha in Devanagari.

  

In it, I have left instructions to myself to explain the glossary and how to make use of it. The copy of Amarakosha that I use for and is mentioned in the glossary is the one created by Sardesai-Padhye in Poona in 1940 in the Poona Oriental Series. It can be downloaded in the .pdf format from archive.or at <https://archive.org/details/AmaraKosa>.

  

I am circulating the glossary here in the hope that someone may find it as useful as I do.

  

(Needless to say, any word in the glossary can be reached through "ctrl+F".)
