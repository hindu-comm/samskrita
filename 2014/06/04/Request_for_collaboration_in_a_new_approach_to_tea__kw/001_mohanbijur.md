Dear Upendraji,

we find all the avenues mentioned are required .inaddition to references to sanskrit magazines like Chandamama,Amarchitra Katha Mahabharatha, Ramamyana epics are to be used while making animations .

we request to check with Samskrita Bharati Bangalore for their suggestion and guidance and other like institutions for their contributions

in your project.

we wish you all the best
