Namaste,

I am planning to create course material for kids of the new millenium by in corporating conversational sentences that make use of common cartoons/ anime characters ,references to sports icons, major league games etc.

In my opinion this should reduce the resistance / inhibitions that that kids have towards learning samskrit and also remove the label of being a language only for religious books.

Towards this , I am also in the process of creating a software that can run from any mobile device and allow the learner to listen to the text being presented.

The software can read ANY text presented in devanagari unicode format.

  

I look forward to suggestions and criticism of this approach.
