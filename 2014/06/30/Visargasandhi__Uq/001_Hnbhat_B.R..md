If sandhi is made, the विसर्ग is lost before र्. and तैः + रामकथा would be तै रामकथा.



If you want to know the सूत्र, you have to understand the complete procedure of the सन्धि.



It would be requiring many other सूत्र, in between the first तैः+रामकथा up to the final तै.



तैः+रामकथा is



changed twice from तै+स्

"ससजुषो रुः" 8.2.66>

तैर्+रामकथा

"रो रि" 8-3-14 will make the र् lost before र्।

and now it will be तै रामकथा।
