Learned Scholars,  
  

As I had some doubt about Visarga Sandhi, I checked with one book I had, but it did not clarify the specific case of तैः रामकथा पठिता \| do I keep visarga as it is or is there a लोप of visarga before र ? or does it turn into र ?  
  

Ishall be obliged for more references on visarga sandhi  
  
  

I shall thank the community for any help (If possible, the sutra)  
  

Satyajita
