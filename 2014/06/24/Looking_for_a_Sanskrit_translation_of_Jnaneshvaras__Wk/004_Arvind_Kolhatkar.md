This is a book in Google Books by the Varkari scholar the late
B.P.Bahirat. Here you get a preview of the book but Appendix B in it at p. 245 is a Sanskrit translation of Amritanubhava. A few pages from it have been kept out of the preview but it looks that almost the whole translation is available for viewing.
