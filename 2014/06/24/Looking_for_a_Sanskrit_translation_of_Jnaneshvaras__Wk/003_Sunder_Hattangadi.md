[Amritanubhava - Ambrosial Experience with Cangadeva Pasati by Sri Jnanadev](http://www.indiaclub.com/shop/searchresults.asp?ProdStock=28900)

  

........"Since Ramana Maharshi had no knowledge of Marathi, his disciple  
Athavale presented him a Sanskrit rendering of Amritanubhava done  
by Badve. After he finished his reading he rapturously told Athavale,  
"You did a great service to me; in this work, I had s direct vision of  
Jnanadeva. So far, I had only heard of him but now I am fully convinced.  
Jnanadeva was a king of saints. How great! I have no words to describe  
his greatness!".....................................

Badve was a poet-saint from Pandharpur. I think his descendants are hereditary priests at the Vithoba Temple there. They may have a copy of the book. (There is a reference

to a Mr. Athavale showing a copy of this book to Ramana Maharshi who is said to have extolled it.)
