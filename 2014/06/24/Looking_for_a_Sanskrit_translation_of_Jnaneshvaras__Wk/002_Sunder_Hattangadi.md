JNANADEVA  
by  
A.G. JAVADEKAR  
M.A., D.LITT.

  

Amritanubhava contains over eight hundred Ovis. Its original name is Anubhavamrita.................

  
The work is of such a great philosophical significance that about a dozen commentaries  
(mostly in Marathi) have been written on it. No other work in Marathi has received  
such a privilege. The earliest commentary was written by Ekanatha (1533––1599 A.D.)  
but is not available though some quotations from it are found in ***Kibe’s commentary Jyotsna.*  
**  
***Pralhadbhuva Badve (d. 1718 A.D.) has written Sanskrit verses on Amritanubhava,***.........  
  
***Harihara’s commentary called Rashtrabhashya (date not known) partly in Sanskrit***  
and partly in Marathi....................................

  
***Jivanmukta––yati writing a Sanskrit commentary in 1919 A.D. .......................***

  

Badve was a poet-saint from Pandharpur. I think his descendants are hereditary priests at the Vithoba Temple there. They may have a copy of the book. (There is a reference

to a Mr. Athavale showing a copy of this book to Ramana Maharshi who is said to have extolled it.)
