Namaste,



There is no sanskrit translation. However, there is a beautiful translation in hindi by Prof.RA Dandekar. I possess this copy and i usually contemplate on this. Chaukhamba has published this.



Infact, Jnanadeva was a great shakta in the lineage of natha sampradaya. He studied sundaryalahari of Sankara and was deeply influenced by this work. And the result is "amritanubhava". This was composed in the temple premises of "sapthashringi" of Vani which also consists of samadhi of Shri Matsyendranatha, the adi guru of natha order.



I have the privilege of visiting this place.



regs,

sriram
