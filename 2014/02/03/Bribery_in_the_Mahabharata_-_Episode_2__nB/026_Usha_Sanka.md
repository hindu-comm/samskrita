Namaste,

please do not say such words sir. They hurt. Elders should not say so. There is no such thing as provocation here.

It is a discussion. And everyone has one's own point to make and view to take.

Yours is poetry-driven view. And Mahabharata is no poetry. Yes, there are many versions of same story and many more interpretations by different people. Some are FOR and some AGAINST. Both have their grounds (Against ones always have worldly views and shallow grounds). But we are here referring to mahabharata and it is a story of dharma. Since dharmic issues need a different level of approach, they cannot be solved by worldly wit and we cannot just pass any judgement on them, without background.

Here the base of issue is Kashyapa accepting money from Takshaka to stay out of Parikshit's life-saving prayatna.

  

Point 1. It was usual practice for brahmanas to take money from kings. Because they were not allowed to earn anything by themselves for livelihood. It was duty of society to take care of their needs. If they keep themselves engaged in earning money, then their tapas, dharma and subtleness of mind will suffer. They had to keep engaged in so many austerities that they hardly had time to think of earning livelihood. So it was not wrong if Kashyapa expects money in return of his service to the king. Without money no one can sustain oneself. They had families too.

  

Point 2. Takshaka was fully aware of powers of Kashyapa. He had taken good test of the latter's tapo-shakti (He burns a tree and asks Kashyapa to make it alive again. The latter succeeds.) and was convinced that he would surely be saving the king. Generally speaking, such a prowess was owned by those leading dharmic life, and we have no recorded evidence at any other place where Kashyapa is adharmic. So only one instance we cannot judge him as corrupt.

  

Point 3. Takshaka holds a discussion with him, asking him to keep away from the issue. He convinced Kashyapa by an ultimate truth that Parikshit is destined to die, his Ayu was over. And one should not interfere with destiny. Parikshit's death had to give way for certain consequences in future and if Kashyapa obstructs that, it would lead to unnecessary diversions. Kashyapa agrees to that. And Takshaka offers him money because it was for money that he wanted to save king. And Takshaka wanted to be fair to that poor brahmana. That's all. So it was no bribery.

  

So - issue of money-taking was not in form of bribe, The ultimate point made by Takshaka was convincing for Kashyapa. So he agreed to go away. Not because he was allured by money.

Takshaka was aware of a brahmana's need, so he offered money. It was usual practice to give money to brahmanas (even today we see it) without any reason also. It earns the giver some puNya.

  

Hope things are clear now. There is no question of rasikata, arasikata here. It is dharma alone that matters.

It is not unusual that we are surrounded by so many anti-Indian, anti-Hindu and anti-dharmic forces (in the form of media etc.) that wash our brains and take it out of its original capacity to think in terms of dharma. It is that confusion which makes us anti-Rishi and anti-Achara atitudes. The very basis of HIndu dharma is that vision of dharma.  

Thankyou
