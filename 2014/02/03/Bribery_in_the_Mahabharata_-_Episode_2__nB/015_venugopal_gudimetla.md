The question certainly is not if MB is a work of fiction or not. For that matter, archeo-astronomical data mentioned in MB suggests it is not a work of fiction. The question in point is bribery charge on Kasyapa period. Even if you consider it to be fiction, one can still question the actions of characters in a fictional work, as MB is a lesson in dharma in itself, just as one understands say a Panchatantra story. MB being a lesson in dharma, it is inconceivable that Kasyapa went unpunished for his adharma if he did take a "bribe". He was one of the Saptarishis and immortal one that too. If puranas uphold him in high regards, making Saptarishis immortal, the responsibility falls on the people who think he took a bribe to prove so, anything else is their opinion against Smritis and it is clear in the matters of confusion, Smiritis and Sruthis have a final word.
