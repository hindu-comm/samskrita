So you agree with the popular verse defining the a Vaidya other than Rajavaidya:

  

वैद्यराज नमस्तुभ्यं यमराजसहोदर ।

यमस्तु हरति प्राणान् वैद्यो प्राणान् धनानि च ॥

  

O vaidya (doctor), brother of Yama(God of Death), I bow down of you. Yama only steals away one's life, but the vaidya steals one's life as well as money.

  

and here he charged for allowing the victim of Takshaka his fees cannot be called bribery.

  

Only the point missed in the whole discussion diverting this episode into bribery, whether it is illegal or legal act of Kashyapa, that Kashyapa was himself was a great sage and the Sage was a great sage, by him he was contracted by his curse. The view as described in the same context in Mahabharata,

  

  

महाभारतम्-01-आदिपर्व-043\\  

सौतिरुवाच।

  

तक्षकस्य वचः श्रुत्वा काश्यपो द्विजसत्तमः।

प्रदध्यौ सुमहातेजाराजानं प्रति बुद्धिमान्।18\|\|

  

**दिव्यज्ञानः स तेजस्वी ज्ञात्वा तं नृपतिं तदा।**

**क्षीणायुषं पाण्डवेयमपावर्तत काश्यपः।।19\|\|**

  

लब्ध्वा वित्तं ***मुनिवर***स्तक्षकाद्यावदीप्सितम्।  

निवृत्ते काश्यपे तस्मिन्समयेन महात्मनि।।20\|\|

  

The above makes clear that he did not return not only because of getting the offer of Takshaka, but to follow the destiny of the King that his death is destined to be ended by that time and he didn't want or could do agaist the destiny. 

  

*आयुः* कर्म च विद्या च वित्तं निधनमेव च ।

पञ्चैतानि विलिख्यन्ते गर्भस्थस्यैव देहिनः ॥

  

according to the Puranic standard and it could not be changed by anyone.

  

So he accepted the offer of Takshaka and returned from there itself. He was very practical and not an ordinary man or ordinary Vishavaidya or Mantrika, but a मुनिवर like the one who cursed the king to be bit by Takshaka.

  

Now there is no question whether only government servants are entitled to bribe or not as the doubt raised. Even though he succeeded in reliving the tree, in the competition, he was not certain about his success in the case of the King and was content to get the money offered so that he could save his credits and earn money as suggested already by Takshaka:

  

विप्रशापाभिभूते च क्षीणायुषि नराधिपे।

घटमानस्य ते विप्र सिद्धिः संशयिता भवेत्।।1-43-14

ततो यशः प्रदीप्तं ते त्रिषु लोकेषु विश्रुतम्।

निरंशुरिव घर्मांशुरन्तर्धानमितो व्रजेत्।।1-43-15

  

and he was convinced of it that he may staking his credentials so far earned by his feat in the case of the king.

  

I have no comments whether it is to be called bribe or remuneration for his service. It is left to who evaluate the context according to modern standards where fixing match is a fashion today and bribery the right of anyone in the machinery of government or according to the standards of Purana-s.

  

श्रुतिर्विभिन्ना स्मृतयो विभिन्नाः नैको मुनिर्यस्य वचः प्रमाणम्। ***धर्मस्य तत्वं निहितं गुहायां*** महाजनो येन गतः सः पन्थाः॥  

  

in the Yakshaprashna it is said धर्मसूक्ष्म is not easily grasped by any one.
