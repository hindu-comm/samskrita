It is not whether there was such a word as "bribe" existed during MB times or not, but it's about opinion formed. What is the driving a person to form such an opinion? Taking a page out of "Being Different" by RM ji, one can say that many terms are digested terms, which are freely applied when studying Indian texts. Many Samskritam terms are not portable into English, for example "Dharma", take the example the word you just mentioned, "Dana" is it really "bribe"? in this scenario and also when not much attention is paid to understand the contextual nature of a person's actions, westerns themes and terms make into discourse which have limited scope in explaining the proper meaning of an action, or completely distort the narration leading to completely false narration and propagation of false notions. It is surprising that Indians are doing this, experts and non-experts alike. It is no wonder that Hindu texts are hijacked and the exact reason behind a narration is lost. Suddenly MB becomes a text where characters are often corrupt. The other day some "expert" had posted that Duryodhana was a kind soul, only that "some people gave him bad name". Such people only add to confusion and deliberately or not lead to degeneration of Samskriti.

  

If a character/person in MB or text is adharmic, it is said so if not in that text, it will proved so in other Smritis or Sruthis, why add our noise and opinions?
