If you are not sure why then throw a stone in the first place? don't you think you are being irresponsible? If you are not aware of the story, why even bother to comment sir? If smrithi doesn't name an act as adharma, so it is not. Who are we to judge? If you are not even sure who one is talking about why even bother? you first judge the action, when called out say there could be multiple versions? this gyana should have prevailed even before you agreed with an opinion no?

  

If one is not sure, one should stay unsure. And yes if you sound I am defending, so be it, if one cannot stand against slander, you don't have the right to be the inherit the heritage. There is no confusion regarding which Kasyapa is being referred to here. Atleast I am not confused. There is a reason why Bhrama asked the Kasyapa to go to Prarikshit. If you are not sure, that's fine but please don't muddy the waters for others.

Venu
