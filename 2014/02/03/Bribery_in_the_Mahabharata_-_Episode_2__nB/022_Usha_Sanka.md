"It is surprising that Indians are doing this, experts and non-experts alike."  

Yes- very true. One should not talk ill of sages and great souls without understanding their words and deeds. They have done great help to human kind in many ways. It isfruit oftheir "tapas" that generations together enjoy. Inner meaning real purport of things reach subtler minds. It takes seconds to put "abhiyogas" but much more time to answer them because it needs great background of dharma and culture.

"It is no wonder that Hindu texts are hijacked and the exact reason behind a narration is lost. "  

Right. There is a long, rich and deep-rooted past behind these works. Kindly when in doubt, please approach the people who are subject experts, and are well-learned in these epics and purANas. It is like one does in cases of other sciences and arts (mathematics, medicine, psychology, grammar etc.). One cannot just jump to conclusions in dharmic issues deciding on one's own. Just for sake of a "newness" one should not misinterpret things related to sages.
