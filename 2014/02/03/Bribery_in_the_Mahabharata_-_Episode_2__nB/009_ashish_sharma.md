Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars  

Pranaam  

Here is my view on this context.  

First of all, as I heard this story from my grand father who was a sanskrit Scholar and a Vaidya(did Vaidya course in Sanskrit language). He had narrated this story to me many times. He told me that there were many people who were trying to save king from Takshak. While Takshak was going to the palace, he incidently met this Maantrik(and not vaidya). I agree that the purpose of Vaidya was to save the life of Human but this guy was a maantrik and he went there for the purpose of getting gifts from the King. If he had went only as believing to obey his duty then taking money from takshak will be called as bribe as he was disobeying his duty. But that Maantrik went only for earning money and not went as a part of duty. Nor King had personally called him for saving his life. There is no relation with king and vaidya related with respect to duty. If the Rajvaidya had taken money and did not fulfilled his duty then that will be called as Bribery.  

Even in the shloka, Kashyapa clearly asks money as a part of his business. He got more money for having the capability of Maantrik Shakti.

  

धनार्थी याम्यहं तत्र तन्मे देहि भुजंगम /

ततोहं विनिवर्तिष्ये स्वापतेयं प्रगृह्य वै //

  

Kasyapa tells Takshaka - I am going there (to Parikshit) to earn some wealth(money). Please give me the same when I will not go there.  
  

His purpose was only to earn money and not went there for any type of duty.  
  

This is my personal view which I had understood from my Gurus.  

In the end I can say that every personal his own aspect of seeing Dharma.  

  

Regards
