To bribe a Doctor, to refrain from his professional duty of saving life, to faciltate the killer is a legal act or not? Both the killer and saver are the same?

How did he know of Takshaka's intent from himself on his way or earlier? In either case, knowingly when a killer serpent is to bite anyone, it is the common sense of anyone to save the life of the person. What about the professional Vaidya who can save the life of the victim of the killer serpent? Is it legal or not? Is he loyal to his profession whether it be Parikshit or any victim of serpent bite whether it be Takshaka? Both taking and giving bribe is illegal as I can judge from our present day standard of moral. I don't comment on the Puranic standards.

  

Anyhow, the illegal act of Takshaka, cost his life itself later including even Indra, by another stronger sage. "सेन्द्राय तक्षकाय स्वाहा" which brought Indra along with his throne, where he took refuge. But fortunately the Sarpa Yaga was stopped by that time.

  

I am writing just from my memory this without quoting any passage, from what I heard of the episode.
