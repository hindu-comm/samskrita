Did Kasyapa ever promise to protect Parikshit?, that he should be judged as taking a "bribe" when he walked away? If anything one can debate whether Kasyapa did perform his dharma as a vaidya or not perhaps, but where is the question of his being bribed? what is the dishonest act did Kasyapa perform by taking money? did Kasyapa know that Parikshit needs to be protected from Takshaka? that one can judge if he knowingly abandoned his dharma as a vaidya? Takshka's intent is not the same as that of Kasyapa's.
