Namaste,

Problems of this kind arise when things of present day (like a concept of bribe- which was unknown to India before foreign invasions) are tried to be applied on ancient days' works. That was a different yuga, different conditions existed then. And moreover dharma is the most sUkShma in nature. They say- it is difficult even for the best-brained and best-learned to "see" it at times. Only unswerving, disengaged, and detached minds can see it.

The same message in the words of great Paramacharya of Kanchi- is- "dharma cannnot be understood by manas, because it is a matter related to AtmA". An untrained Manas always misinterprets it. So it should be left for the sage-minds (like in vyAkaraNa issues, Patanjali's words are considered final) to decide issues. Their commentaries are alone helpful in understanding things in their true light.
