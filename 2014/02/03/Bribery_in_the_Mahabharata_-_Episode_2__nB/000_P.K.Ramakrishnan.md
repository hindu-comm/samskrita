The serpent Thakshaka was on his way to the place where Parikshit was residing to bite him as ordered by the serpent king. On the way he saw Kashyapa who was also going to Parikshit to get

him cured and come back to life. When Kashyapa enquired from Thakshaka, he replied that he

was the serpent going to bite the King. Thakshaka asked Kashyapa to show his powers. Then the

serpent bit a Banyan tree nearby. It was burnt to ashes. Kashyapa with his mantrasakti brought

back the tree. This surprised Thakshaka. He requested Kashyapa to withdraw from the project and

that he would be compensated with whatever he would earn if he revived the King. Kasyapa accepted the offer and did not proceed further.

  

The amount is a bribe. According to law a giver of bribe and the person who rceives the bribe are

currupt. There is no mention whether anyone reported this to the authorties and what happened

later.

  

The relevant quotations from Mahabharata -

  

धनार्थी याम्यहं तत्र तन्मे देहि भुजंगम /

ततोहं विनिवर्तिष्ये स्वापतेयं प्रगृह्य वै //

  

Kasyapa tells Takshaka - I am going there (to Parikshit) to earn some wealth(money). Please give me the same when I will not go there.

  

यावद्धनं प्रार्थयसे तस्माद् राज्नस्तथोधिकम् /

अहमेव प्रदास्यामि निवर्तस्व द्विजोत्तम //

  

Tkakshaka replied - Whatever you are going to get from the king, I will give you more than that.

  

लब्ध्वा धनं मुनिवर: तक्षकात् यावदीप्सितं /

निवृत्ते काश्यपे तस्मिन् समयेन महात्मनि /

जगाम तक्षकस्तूर्णम् नगरं नागसाह्वयम् //

  

When Kasyapa got what he wanted and returned, Takshaka quickly went to the city called Naagasa. (Where Parikshit was staying).

  

The end of this story.
