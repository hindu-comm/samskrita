Without much unneeded details, Takshaka was going to kill Parikshit, and Kashyapa was going to save him and he proved he can do it as a Vishavaidya. As a killer, Takshaka, bribed Kashapa, to refrain from his duty as Vaidya from saving his patient.

  

So this is illegal to help the killer serpent, in spite of the same fees he can get from the king or greater than that.

  

This is my view.

  

And I had given another story more ancient than Mahabharata incident of this bribery, from the Aitereya Brahmana, what we call today

Please read the above and compare todays sportsment or team who loose the sport getting money. Fixing the match is legal, as the players play for money, either by losing the match or gaining victory, huge amount they get, this also can be called legal.
