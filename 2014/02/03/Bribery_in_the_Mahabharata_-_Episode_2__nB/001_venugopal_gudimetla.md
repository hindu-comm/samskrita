Kindly comment on what is illegal and dishonest about accepting money by Kasyapa in this context? Thakshaka gave him more than what he wanted, and he returned. Did Kasyapa ever promise to save the life of Parikshit that now going away from his promise and accepting money made him corrupt? He was going there to get money, which he himself mentioned, there is nothing secret about it nor it is illegal, Parikshit is giving gifts as part of Yagna so he was going there. Someone stopped him and asked him to return and in doing so he would get more than that. So pray do tell what you found to be corrupt on the part of Kasyapa. People give gifts on marriages and other auspicious occasion, are they bribes too? Please do comment.  
  
Thanks,  
Venu
