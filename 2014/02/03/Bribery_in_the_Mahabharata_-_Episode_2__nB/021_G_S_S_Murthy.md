I am not personally familiar with the original story in Mahabharata. Still I venture to suggest that there is no need to go out of the way to defend what one Kashyapa did.All are aware that different versions of a story are in different puranas and mythological sources. The very fact that one version of a story given in a particular Purana tries to vary the story to mitigate the crime of a character proves that we need not take any particular version to be true. Secondly, names like Bharadwaja, Vasishtha, Kasyapa etc. do not necessarily refer to a single person. They are just Gotra names. Vasishtha is the royal priest for Raghuvamsa. It would be too much to believe that the same Vasishtha was the priest for all Raghavas.
