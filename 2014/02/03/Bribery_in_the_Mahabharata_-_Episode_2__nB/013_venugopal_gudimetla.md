**I am not sure why people jump to conclusions to fast. Mahabharata was a lesson in Dharma first and foremost. None went unpunished when one didn't live by dharma. Secondly none was granted with immortality, unless they lived by dharma. Kasyapa is one of those immortal rishis who was granted immortality till the end of humanity. This should give a hint whether Kasyapa ever went against dharma.  
  
Pl see for reference Sri Potana's Mahabharatam:  
**

**After Takshaka reveals to Kasyapa his intent of biting Parikshit and killing him, Kasyapa see's this happen in his divyadristi. He sees Parikshit dying when Takshaka bites Parikshit. Upon seeing this Kasyapa comes to the conclusion about his futility of attempts to save Parikshit. It is then Kasyapa decides to take the amount offered by Takshaka and returns.  
  
**

**Before his meeting Takshaka, Kasyapa does sets on a journey to save Parikshit. At no time Kasyapa's intent was to gain dana/money or to abandon his dharma of saving Parikshit. But it is his divyadrishti which convinces him that Parikshit is certain to die in spite of his trying that he leaves. At no point Kasyapa abandoned his dharma, nor was dishonest, it is only the futility of his attempts of saving Parikshit that convinces him to leave, not the lure of money as would have been the case if he was "brirbed" as you claim.
