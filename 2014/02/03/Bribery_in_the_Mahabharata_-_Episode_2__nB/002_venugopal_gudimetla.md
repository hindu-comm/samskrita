Another analogy, say I was invited to a marriage and I am going there because the host promised to give me gifts if I attend the wedding. Now on the way, someone meets me and asks me to go back and if I do, he would pay me more than the host would pay. So I take the money and return home. Is that a bribe that I took?

  
  
Thanks,
