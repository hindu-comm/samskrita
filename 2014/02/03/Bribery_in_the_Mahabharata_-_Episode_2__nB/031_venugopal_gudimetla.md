Sri Murthy MahodayaH,

  

Kindly pardon me, I didn't mean to be insulting. Kindly see this:

<http://www.amazon.com/Invading-Sacred-Analysis-Hinduism-Studies/dp/8129111829/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1392051500&sr=1-1&keywords=invading+the+sacred>

  

Please see the brief review of the book. Even though it might seem impertinent to the discussion, I just wanted to point to you that, we have a responsibility to preserve what is ours.We have faced constant onslaught before and still do from external agencies like mentioned in the book above. Why should we add our own noise and further deteriorate anything further? I ask your apology if I hurt you, but kindly see my intention if you could.
