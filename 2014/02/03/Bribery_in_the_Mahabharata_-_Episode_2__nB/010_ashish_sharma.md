Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars  

Pranaam  
  

There is one more point which I wish to say.  
I thought again and discussed with other enlightened Gurus and realised that yes, Kashyapa was unethical. He did misdeed. His act was not correct. On the point of Dharma, We can surely call his task as unethical BUT this unethical task wont be called as bribery. Kashyap act was not good as he didnt tried to save king but on the other hand, as he was not a part of raj vaidya or rajmaantrik therefore it wont be called as bribery. For example, If some vaidya is working under king and he has to do some duty for the king or kingdom. If someone give him money for not to do his duty then it will be an unethical deed and will be called as bribery whereas other person who is not bounded by any duty for the kingdom. If he wont obey his task then it will be unethical but wont be called as bribery.  
  
I hope I have conveyed my thought.  
  
Regards  
  
Ashish Sharma
