Bharatiya Vidyabhavan, Sanskritbharati have several delightful and non-intimidating small books you may purchase; they also have several videos (free video lessons on youtube) for learning spoken samskrutam.
In fact, there is too much material -- embarassment of the riches. I just came across -- [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) (haven't checked it yet). Try these. If you find anything useful (to teach kids) and interesting, could you please post it here? Also there are several videos -- animated stories of panch-tantra, hitopadesha and great classics (plays but not in animation --but real time enactment on stage!) Only problem is you may have to invest your time in surfing around in the cyber-loke:))Good luck!

Thank you kindly.
