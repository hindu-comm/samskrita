I got the word in Monier Williams Dictionary:

  

बाध्व \[ bādhva \] \[ bādhva \] m. patr. N. of a Ṛishi Lit. AitĀr. (w.r. \[ bādhyā \] ) .  

  

Here is the details in Vedic Index:

बाध्व

  

\[L=2160\] \[p= 2-066\]

Bādhva is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka

(iii. 2, 3). The reading in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (viii. 3)

is Vātsya. \[Footnote: 1) See Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 249, n. 1.\]

  

Now it should be clear that it is a name.

  

The rest is clear.

  

  

भूतं भावि च भवदपि भगवन्मायेति बुधमुखाद् बुद्ध्वा।

आध्वं स्वस्थास्सततं बाध्व इवानन्दबोध*निष्यन्दाः*॥

  

  

Knowning from the learned ones' teachings that whatever thing past (भूतं) present (भवद्) and future to come (भावि), is the माया of the lord (भगवत्), all of you please remain ( आध्वम्) स्वस्थाः - self-realized a spring of experiene of bliss  आनन्दबोध-*निष्यन्दाः* like वाध्व, the sage.

  

With a minor correction as I found in the printed book makes the above sense. Or as you have given, it will mean like बाध्व who is a spring of exprience of bliss.

  

The variation needs little change in the adjective स्वस्थाः as remain self realized, or be content, peaceful like बाध्व.

  

  

This बाध्व is quoted by Madhvacharya also

  

*चत्वारः पुरुषा इति बाध्वः* शरीरपरुषश्छन्दः पुरु षो वदेपुरुषो महापुरुष इति।

  

in his उपनिषद्भाष्य also.
