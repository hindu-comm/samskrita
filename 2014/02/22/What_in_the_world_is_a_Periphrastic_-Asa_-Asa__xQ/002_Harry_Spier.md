You might be refering to what is called the "periphrastic future" in Whitney's Sanskrit grammar section 942- 944 or Coulson's Teach Yourself Sanskrit page 167.  
Quoting Coulson:  

\[Periphrastic future .... the use of the agent noun to form a comparatively rare tense known as the periphrastic future. ...The agent noun is used predicatively to refer to future time, with the verb "as" in the first and second persons, without in the third person:...

Coulson gives the examples: kartāsmi 'I am to do', kartā 'he/she is to do'  kartā smaḥ  'we are to do'...  
He also says: "The tense is used especially for events fixed for a particular future time: often, in fact, the verb is accompanied by an adverb of time. Thus

śva āgantā "he is to come tomorrow".
