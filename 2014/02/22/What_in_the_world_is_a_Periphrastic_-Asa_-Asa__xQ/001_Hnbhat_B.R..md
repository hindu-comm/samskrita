What do you want by translating English or Greek into Sanskrit? Do you want to learn English or Sanskrit?

  

I don't understand your question. If you want to understand the English Word, you can refer to the English Dictionaries available in multiple numbers online and offline and its grammar and origin will be given.

  

Here is the simple explanation for the English/Greek Word used in English as explained in the dictionary it is an adjective:

  

Roundabout and unnecessarily wordy.  

  

as in

  

"had a preference for periphrastic rather than forthright expression"; "A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,/ Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle/ With words and meanings."  

  

And you have to learn Greek to know the usage of the word in English.

  

Now to learn its usage in Sanskrit, the word is not used in English nor its translated word as you have given. But please learn to use the Grammar texts in the proper way how they have designed it.That would be benificiary.
