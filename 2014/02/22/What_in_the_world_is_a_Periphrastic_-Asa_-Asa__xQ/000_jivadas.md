**What in the world is a Periphrastic \<.Asa>? It is \>Greek \<peri-phrasis>, which becomes "peri-phrastic". The Gk \<peri> is like Skt. #pari परि and \_-phrastic\_ refers to a phrase of speech. So I would guess the Skt equivalent तो be parivAda परिवाद.**

**But when I look in Kale and other grammars, I get only the Engl>Greek term. What is the saMskRta name?  **

**And what is its proper use when defining time in a story?**
