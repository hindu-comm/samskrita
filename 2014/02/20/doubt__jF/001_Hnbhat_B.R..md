First know what is मध्यमपुरुष and उत्तमपुरुष:

  

1-4-105 युष्मद्युपपदे समानाधिकरणे स्थानिन्यपि मध्यमः।  

1-4-107 अस्मद्युत्तमः\|  

  

When युष्मत् is used as the subject, or implied, it will take the verb in मध्यमपुरुष. and the same case, with अस्म्त् as the subject or it is implied, by the use of उत्तमपुरुष suffixes. That means, गच्छामि implies अहं गच्छामि, गच्छसि implies त्वं गच्छसि in the मध्यमपुरुष.

  

  

शेषे प्रथमः॥ १।४।१०७\|\|  

  

Any other noun or pronoun than these two, will take प्रथमः पुरुषः.  

  

नाम्रि प्रयुज्यमाने तु प्रथम : पुरुषो भवे‌त्‌ ।

मध्यमो युष्मदि प्रोक्तउत्तम : पुरुषोऽस्मदि ॥२०॥

This is made clear in the above verse. All other nouns or pronouns take प्रथमपुरुष. The pronouns, तत्, इदम्, भवत् all are other than युष्मत् and युष्मत् and take only प्रथमपुरुष suffixes, like any other noun acting as subject for the predicate. Now it should be clear that भवत् would always take प्रथमपुरुष suffixes for the verb related to it.
