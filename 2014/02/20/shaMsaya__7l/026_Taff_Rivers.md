On a technical point, English, not Sanskrit - not all affixes are suffixes:

  

 there is the prefix

 the infix

 as well as the suffix.

  

  

As regards Sanskrit, I have been trying to find examples of**kṛt**
'affixes', that are not 'suffixes'

 • (*t*), *m.* an affix used to form nouns from roots, *VPrāt. Pāṇ. 3-1, 93; 4, 67; vi, 1, 71; vii, 2, 8* and 11; 3, 33; viii, 4, 29.

anduṇ-ādi
