Exactly now you have produced the active voice of the sentence:

  

I have to eat the fruit.

  

It is one of the implications of विधिलिङ्.

  

विधि-निमन्त्रण-आमन्त्रण-अधीष्ट-संप्रश्न-प्रार्थनेषु लिङ् । । ३,३.१६१ । । लोट् च ।।

  

In the imperative, both विधिलिङ्, and लोट् both are used in the active and passive voice. But the तव्य and अनीय are used in the passive voice only and in all tenses. Not only in the tense विधिलिङ्.

  

Now for the active sentence, in विधिलिङ्, used in the imperative,

  

both forms are available:

  

अहं फलं खादेयम्। Active Voice in विधिलिङ्।

  

The passive structure of the above is

  

मया फलं खाद्येत।

  

and you can use both the forms खाद्यम्, खादनीयम्, खादितव्यम् as adjective to फल, which is always the object of the verb irrespective of the Subject, मया, त्वया, अस्माभिः, युष्माभिः or रामेण,

i.e. The fruit (eligible) to be eaten.

  

अर्हे कृत्यतृचश्च॥ ३।३।१६९॥

  

भवता खलु कन्या वोढव्या, वाह्या, वहनीया। भवान् खलु कन्याया वोढा। भवान् खलु कन्यां वहेत्। भवानेतदर्हेतिति।

  

See the above different usages.

  

कृत्याश्च॥ ३।३।१७१\|\|  

भवता खलु अवश्यं कटः कर्तव्यः, अवश्यं करणीयः, अवश्यं कार्यः, अवश्यं कृत्यः।  

  

शकि लिङ् च॥ ३।३।१७२\|\|  

भवता खलु भारो वोढव्यः, वहनीयः, वाह्यः। भवान् खलु भारं वहेत्। भवानिह शक्तः।  

  

The oblication is on the part of the subject and eligibility of the fruit in the object.

  

That is the difference, between the usage of the लिङ् and कृत्य suffixes.

I think the lessons are not always reliable.

See the above structure. There is no form एषाः for the pronoun एतत्. ONLY the nominative singular form is

  

एषा. But in in the other numbers, it will be

एते - एताः।

  

The pronoun is एतत्, AND it cannot be derived like other आकारान्त feminine nouns, like रमा . रमे - रमाः, or बालिका - बालिके - बालिकाः। So it is natural for them, if they confuse you with their teaching in English.

  

There it is clearly written that  विधिलिङ् is not used in the same tense, but the formss तव्यत्,तव्य, अनीय could take-offs to it, in the passive. Please see the forms completely in all the persons for paassive voice constructions, in case of any doubt in the earlier lessons as they have requested.

Please go through the earlier lessons regarding the passive and active constructions.
