Both are used in Mahabharata:

  

अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् ।

यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति *नास्त्यत्र संशयः* ॥ 6-32-5  

  

घातयिष्यति मे स्रवान्पुत्रान्भीमो *न शंसयः।*

न हि पश्यामि तं वीरं यो मे रक्षेत्सुतान्रणे ॥ 6-65-10\|\|

  

Do you find any difference in meaning in the above two usages in Mahabharata, as found in Sanskrit Documents list? It is critical Edition of souther Recension.

  

Mme. Sreelatha may explain the difference in the two usages above.
