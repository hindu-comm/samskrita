Dear Patel,

  

खादितव्यम् is not passive form of विधिलिङ्, and खाद्येव is not the passive form in the प्रथमपुरुष, but it is in उत्तमपुरुष, which means I would be eaten. अहं खाद्येय.

  

If you want use the suffixes correctly, you should know the active forms and passive forms correctly.

  

अहं फलं खादेयम् = I should eat fruit.

  

मया फलं खाद्येत The frould should be eaten by me.

  

The same would mean by the passive forms: तव्य, तव्यत्, अनीयर्

  

मया फलं खादितव्यम् =

मया फलं खादनीयम् =

मया फलं खाद्यम् =

मया फलं खादितुं शक्यम्, योग्यमित्यर्थः।

  

  

the fruit is to be (would be) eaten by me. Only in this future tense, लिङ् is used synonymously with कृत्य suffixes. according to 3-3-172 शकि लिङ् च\|

  

  

  

This is the translation of what you have given, corrected according to Sanskrit grammar.
