I don't understand what do you want.

  

If you want to write Sanskrit Poem, you can write both in Sanskrit verse or prose order.

  

If you want to read also you can read it in the same order as it is written by others as you can see it printed.

  

There is no other specific rules. If want to know or understand poems in Sanskrit prose or poetry, you should know first Sanskrit Language and Grammar. This is my view and then you can read and understand the poetry or prose written by Sanskrit poets who were masters of the language.

  

If you want to know how to make anvaya, i.e. put in syntactic order, see the verses of Bhagavadgita:

or read this discussion:
