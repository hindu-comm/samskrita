King Parikshit was on a hunting spree in the forest. He was chasing a deer which disappeared from his vision.  He saw a Muni named Samika
doing tapas. He wanted to elecit some information from him. But he was a Mauni, not opening his mouth. Frustrated Parikshit took a dead snake by his bow and put it around the neck of the Muni and went away.

  

After sometime the son of the Muni named Sringii came there. On seeing the dead snake on his father's neck,he cursed the perpetrator of the crime that he would be bit by the serpent Takshaka on the seventh day.

Later when the father Muni heard about his son's curse, he told his son that it was not correct.

He sent his disciple Gauramukha to Parikishit to appraise him of the curse advising him to take all precautions as the curse could not be withdrawn.

On hearing the news a Brahmin named Kasyapa wanted to revive Parikshit by his mantras. When he

was on his way he happened to come across Takshaka who was also going to Parikshhit to bite him

and send him to heaven. Read episode 2.
