Acarya Siddhasena Divakara is one of few seers who are venerated equally in both Jain traditions - Digambara and Shvetambara. He lived in the 4th or 5th centuries of the Common Era. It is believed that he was a teacher to King Vikramaditya, who had honoured him with the sobriquet of 'Divakara' owing to his deep, penetrating intelligence.

  

Acarya Siddhasena Divakara was a profound thinker and logician. His work ‘Sanmatitarka’ occupies a place of honour amongst Indian works on philosophy and formal logic. Siddhasena also composed some extremely important dvatrimshikas {philosophical works of 32 verses} which conveyed extremely important philosophical information. Composed in impeccable Sanskrit, these dvatrimshikas serve as authentic sources of Jain doctrine.

  

This text talks about the importance of independent thinking and emphasises the importance of rational thought. Siddhasena articulates the grave danger of taking things for granted and warns against accepting any information as factual without rigorously testing it. Logic and internal consistency must be our cornerstones for examining things. He advocates open-minded study in place of blind acceptance. Through pithy examples, he exposes the absurdity of accepting something just because it is old. Age itself is not sufficient grounds for veneration.

  

I have translated this text in English to ensure that this supremely rational text becomes accessible to the widest possible readership. And we are proud to publish this as volume 34 of the Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series.
