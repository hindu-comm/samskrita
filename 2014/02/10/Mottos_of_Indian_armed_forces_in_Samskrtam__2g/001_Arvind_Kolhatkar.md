\<[Indian Air Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force "Indian Air Force")-"Nabha sparsham Deeptam"-नभस्पर्शं दीप्तम्>

  

The correct rendering is 'नभ:स्पृशं दीप्तम्'and comes from the Geeta in Ch 11 as

  

नभ:स्पृशं दीप्तमनेकवर्णं व्यात्ताननं दीप्तविशालनेत्रम् ।

दृष्ट्वा हि त्वां प्रव्यथितान्तरात्मा धृतिं न विन्दामि शमं च विष्णो ॥ ११-२४ ॥

  

As I remember to have read, this was suggested as a motto to the IAF by Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, a former President of India.

  

Similar corrections are needed in the other quotes.
