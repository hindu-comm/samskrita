Namaste,

Yes. There are many mistakes in Samskrtam words wherever we find them in the world in non-Samskrtam fields. It pains a lot.

I did not know how to let those institutions know about these mistakes. English has limited sounds to spell Samskrtam words. But even then some could be corrected easily. Can someone let me know, how to make them aware of this issue? Where to write them?
