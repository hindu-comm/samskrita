Namaste. I had the pleasure of seeing this a few days ago. Generally speaking, Mr.Kapoor has indeed made several valid points. But he shows a tendency to present his views as facts. As this video is doing the rounds in many fora, some correction would be in order.

Sample this:Alluding to the appeal in the Supreme Court, Mr Kapoor says "...I think Ranganathan Justice was the Chief Justice. Some Ranganathan or Rangachari.Generally they are Ranganathans or Rangacharis.."

Who are "they" who are "generally Ranganathans and Rangacharis" was not clear to me.

Then he says Mr. Ranganathan/Rangachary was reluctant to take up the case for fear of foregoing post-retirement sinecures. As we shall see shortly, there was no Ranganathan or Rangachary as CJI then or at any time. So we can leave him out.

But Justice Kuldeep Singh ( I have nothing against him. This judgement and the judgements he delivered in cases relating to environmental issues call for courage and commitment which justice Singh has in plenty) went on to become the Chairman of the Delimitation Commission post-retirement.This is just to say Justice Singh's judgements and views havent come in the way of post retirement appointments contrary to Mr.Kapoor's estimate of the post-retirement fate of bold judges.

I am attaching a list of CJIs of India(Taken from the Hon. SC's site). You will see that there are no Ranganathans/Rangacharis as CJIs. You will also see that there is only one CJI with a similar name. The period too is relevant.

He is Justice Ranganath Mishra.
