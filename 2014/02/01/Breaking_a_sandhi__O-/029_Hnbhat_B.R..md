\> Regarding the change ofट to त due to change of ष to स . In the comments of Madhaviya dhatuvritty (avl on net) they have commented there is no rule to force the change from murdhanya to taalavya and the dhatu forms are give in an artificial form. Sir the rule suggested (निमित्तापाये नैमित्तिकस्याप्यपायः)is it part of any varthika or commentary?

It is an independent परिभाषा and not part of any Vartika or commentary.

ष was there in the dhatupadha.

\> The original dhatu originallyस्तु has becomeष्टु in dhatupadha and becomesस्तु due to reversal of ष to स and consequently the change of ट to त ?

It was removed due to the rule धात्वादेः षः सः (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.६४ and the ष्टुत्व due to the presence of ष - the change of त \> ट is also reverted due operation of this परिभाषा. It does not change any ट into त, but reinstates original form before the change due to sandhi rules. The same rule is quoted by Sri Nityananda also in the fuller derivation:
