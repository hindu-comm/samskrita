I wish to understand as to how and under which rules



स्तु + स्तु + क्वसु becomes तुष्टुवस्

The meaning of the root स्तु is mentioned as "Praise" in the W.D. Whitney's book , "The Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language". With the formation of this word, what is the derived meaning of the word तुष्टुवस् ?
