Can you please share more details like who (you use they in plural, Madhaviya Dhatuvrtti is work of a single author) has commented this and where. Perhaps the quote or citation would help.

If the theउपदेश state is taken as the“original” state, the root is ष्टु in original state, and the स् आदेश is by 6-1-64 धात्वादेः षः सः. Thatस्, and not ष्, is an आदेश (replacement) is clear from the rule8-3-59 आदेशप्रत्यययोः and examples under it.

  

One can say that the form in the Dhatupatha is artificial, but in some cases the form is seen in the real world too. For example we have forms like स्तुत, स्तभ्नोति/स्तभ्नाति, etc but when prefixed by वि, they become also विष्टुत, विष्टभ्नोति/विष्टभ्नाति etc. This only happens for roots with ष् in the उपदेश state (i.e. in the Dhatupatha). For roots which do not have ष् in उपदेश state, as स् is not an आदेश but the original state, 8-3-59 आदेशप्रत्यययोः does not apply. Hence you get forms likeविस्तृत/विसृजति where there is noष्by 8-3-59.
