Sir

The web link referred is <http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvcanidx/disp1/CanIndexAbout.html>. The opinion is according to the views expressed by Sharf. His work madhaviyadhatuvrttisaiddhantikanukramani is seen referred.

According to the view, dhatus which are षोपदेेश with dental letter (दन्त्य ) are shown in an artificial manner as ष्त instead of ष्ट .

  

The present paribhaasha is easier to grasp.

  

Regards.

MBSN.
