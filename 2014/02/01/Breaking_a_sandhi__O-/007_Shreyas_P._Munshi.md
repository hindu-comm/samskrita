Respected Bhat Sir,

Thank you. I realize I had forgotten to place 'a' before "G' in the Roman transliteration.

and thank you for the splitting the sandhis in Devanagari of the whole mantra.

You know, the online "[spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de)" did not show 'tuSTuvas' as the valid entry and so I had a doubt.

Thanks again.

Regards...Shreyas
