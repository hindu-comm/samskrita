Exactly. क्वसु- suffix is substitute for the लिट्, and all the formation of लिट् except the suffix are applied. 

  

This is applied generally to Vedic usage, but some specic roots listed in the next सूत्र-s I have given in my earlier Sutra-s.

  

भाषायां सद-वस-श्रुवः ॥ पा.सू.३,२.१०८ ॥

उपेयिवान् अनाश्वान् अनूचानश् च ॥ पा.सू.३,२.१०९ ॥  

  

The last lists the already derived words, from इण् गतौ, अशू व्याप्तौ, वच परिभाषणे respectively which you have rightly pointed out. All these are declined in the same way.
