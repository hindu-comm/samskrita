Sir,

Regarding the change ofट to त due to change of ष to स . In the comments of Madhaviya dhatuvritty (avl on net) they have commented there is no rule to force the change from murdhanya to taalavya and the dhatu forms are give in an artificial form. Sir the rule suggested (निमित्तापाये नैमित्तिकस्याप्यपायः)is it part of any varthika or commentary?

The original dhatu originallyस्तु has becomeष्टु in dhatupadha and becomesस्तु due to reversal of ष to स and consequently the change of ट to त ?

Regards.

MBSN.
