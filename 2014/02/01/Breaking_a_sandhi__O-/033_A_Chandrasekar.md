Sir,

The meaning of तुष्टुवस् is explained as "one who has praised".
Similarly, the meaning of ईयिवस् is explained as "one who has gone",
"one who has obtained" &c in Monier Williams Online Dictionary. In this context, the meaning "one who has praised" for तुष्टुवस् or तुष्टुवान् appears to be correct, but in context of the text of the mantra, the meaning "one who is praising" or तुष्टुवांसः "those who are praising" appears to be more suitable. Please advise.



With regards,



A.Chandrasekar
