स्तु + स्तु does not become तुष्टुवस्, but स्तु + क्वसु becomes तुष्टुवस् by the rule क्वसुश्च ३-१- १०७.

Do you know the लिट् form of स्तु - तुष्टाव and its meaning and by which rules it got the form तुष्टु - णल्? The same rules make तुष्टु - before क्वसु। तुष्टुवस् - declined like विद्वस् this word gets nominative singular तुष्टुवान् -
