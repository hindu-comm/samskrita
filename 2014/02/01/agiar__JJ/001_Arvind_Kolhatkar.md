\<Agiar is derived word from agniagaar.\>

  

I am not sure one can assert this with any certainty. The civilization seen in Avesta and that in the Vedas are close relatives. This connection is well-known and much studied. Who borrowed what from whom is a moot question. Probably, both borrowed from a more distant ancestor.
