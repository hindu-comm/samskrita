Thanks for your observation that Panini may be illogical in representing dhAtu-s without any svara. 

  



Now you have made it clear. Thanks for your logical thinking.

  

Anyhow, the readers are able to identify they are the very and the same धातु-s by seeing its different forms who know the forms already used.

  

Welcome to your paper in advance.

  

Generally, where the specific Gana is to be identified by its वार्त्तिकम् – इक्श्तिपौ धातुनिर्देशे इति वक्तव्यम् (under 3-3-108) – is the guiding principle, by which the Gana to which it belogs, would be easily identified by the readers.

And in some cases, still ambiguity is left and in such cases, all the धातु-s are take having the similiar forms represented by the सूत्र-s take the suffix or any कार्य prescribed by the सूत्र --- and the commentators may disagree with each other.

  

"गामादाग्रहणेष्वविशेषः" (व्या।प।१२४)  

  

is the guiding principle.

  

द्यतिस्यति*मा*स्थामित्ति किति॥[७।४।४०](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/7.4.40)

  

All the verbs are taken with their roots by श्तिप् suffix, while, मा has been taken barely the stem form without any distinction. There are three धातु-s with the same form"

  

"मा माने" (धा।पा।१०६२), "माङ माने" (धा।पा।११४२), "मेङ प्रणिदाने" (धा।पा।९६१)--  

  

All the three take इत् prescribed in the सूत्र and all take the forms alike

  

मितः, मितवान्, मितिः etc.

  

There are many परिभाषा-s also written by व्याडि, सीरदेव, and finally with commentary by नागेशभट्ट is finalised collecting maxims found in महाभाष्य itself. These are helpful for traditional learners to understand the सूत्र-s and their applications, in case of doubt. The Vartika-s modify many सूत्र-s and महाभाष्य has altogether cancelled many of the सूत्र-s themselves as untenable and otherwise the function could be achieved. But no scholar learned ever thought about illogical decision of Panini or his incompetency, as some modern learners of grammar do. For traditional learners, all the three Panini, Vararuci and Patanjali are equally respected as authorities in Grammar and none is considered as incompetent because the other has modified or supplemented additional rules. But only "यथोत्तरं मुनीनां प्रामाण्यम्" is an accepted rule by the traditional scholars in case of difference of opinion. Mahabhashya is the final authority and in case of doubt about the explanations, Nagesha Bhatta's decisions are final. And nobody endeavors to pass a decision or opinion, with his limited knowledge of grammar.
