I think it is not. See my reply to this question in the earlier post.

Please check this link:

Here is earler Edition by SM Katre with accentuation in Roman transliterated text:

  

Katre, Sumitra M., Astadhyayi of Panini, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1987.

Reprint Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1989. ISBN 0-292-70394-5  

  

Now it may be out of print and the Panini Mandir Publication has yet to be completed as per the information in the first link.

  

For traditional scholars, they accept when the function इत् is found in the application of the specific suffixes, they accept the उपदेश having अनुनासिक, the vowels and otherwise not. They didn't find the need to get it marked.

  

Those who want to know it from the accents, the two above publications may be used. Or wait for their publication, if they are not available or prepare such a fresh Edition for the learners अष्टाध्यायी।
