I don't know why you consider पुत्रात् should be used in the sentence.

  

and say पुत्रेण is right.

  

  

Please

there is no such structure.

  

क्त suffix can be used to a verbal root only and not for any noun. Where did you get such an explanation as you have given?

  

सोढ itself a कृदन्त derived word with the suffix क्त. and it cannot be added one more क्त to get the form सोढम्।

  

सोढः, सोढा, सोढम् are the nominative singular forms of the word सोढ in masculine, feminine and neuter genders.

  

So what is your doubt?
