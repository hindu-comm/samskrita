Yes. He gives the name of Agni. Why should you look for any other meaning than it is the name of a Agni?

  

I don't understand. If you want, you may refer to some other commentary. There is no rule the name should describe its meaning. If it is यौगिक it is expected to explain the word formation and doesn't differ from the derivation of the word in meaning.

  

You can refer to any commentary on the portion.
