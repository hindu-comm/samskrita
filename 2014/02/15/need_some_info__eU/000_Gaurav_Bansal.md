hi all,  
I want to do 1year or 2 year distance learning course on sanskrit. I know very little sanskrit (that too because of having a sanskrit subject in my school for 2 years) but i want to have indepth knowledge of sanskrit so that i can study the literature in sanskrit. Can anyone provide me following info :  
1) While searching on google i came across sanskrit bharati two year correspondence course ( <http://samskritabharati.in/archives/269> ). Please provide me feedback about this course.  
2) Also let me know about similar courses from any other institutes which are possibly better (than the sanskrit bharati course) or may be equally good.  
thanks,  
gaurav
