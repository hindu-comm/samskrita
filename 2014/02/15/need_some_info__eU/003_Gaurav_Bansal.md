Hari Om,  
Thanks for the reply and providing me links for lectures. After seeing your reply and some other posts on this group, i see following options :  
1) Sanskrit Bharati distance learning 2 year course ( <http://samskritabharati.in/archives/269> ).  
2) Advaita Academy books & lectures (<http://advaita-academy.org/Pages/Default.aspx>) as pointed by you.  
3) Series of "Teach yourself Sanskrit" books by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan  
4) Course from Rashtrya Samskruta Vidyapeetha, Tirupati  
  
Though i have started listening to video lectures from the link given by you, i want to go ahead with some course from the above options. Please let me know which will be a better option to go with.  
thanks,  
gaurav
