Gaurav ji,  
  

The group members have offered multiple suggestions as you have noted. Now it is up to you to pick a path and follow through. Every method has its strengths and limitations. I can vouch for both the Samskrita Bharati curriculum and the Rashtriya Samskrit Santhan's self-study books, having studied and taught using both of them. I have not seen the Advaita academy books - so I can't comment.  
  

Generally I have observed that it is best to study with a group instead of self-study, especially when one is a beginner. So whichever path you pick, I would encourage you to factor this.  
  

Best,  

  

Naresh
