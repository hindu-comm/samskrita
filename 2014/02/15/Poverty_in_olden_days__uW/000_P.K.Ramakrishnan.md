Those were days when people did not have money

to buy proper dresses. This story is reflected in the

following sloka -

  

अयं पटो मे पितुरङ्गभूषितम्

पितामहाद्यैरुपभुक्तयौवनम् /

मयाधुनाकक्षपुटेनधार्यते

अलंकरिष्यत्यथ पुत्रपौत्रकान् //

  

This garment was worn by my father.

When it was new it was worn by my

grandafather and great grand father.

I am now keeping it in my arm pit.

It will also be worn by my son and grandson.
