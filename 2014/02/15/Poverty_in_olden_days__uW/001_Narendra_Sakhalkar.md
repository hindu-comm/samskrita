!\]First line-Pato is masculine gender,but its qualifying adjective,piturangabhooshitam is neuter gender,  

2\]The second line \[Pitmahadyaiihi.....\] does not have any explicit role in furthering the message of the first line.  

3\]The message in the third line implies that the cloth is NOT being used by the Kawibruva.  

4\]Sanskrit tradition requires that any piece of writing must have fostered some Rasa to qualify for being called a Kawyam,\[Wakyam rasatmakam kawakyam,gadyaam,padyam cha taedwidha\].The shloka quoted here does not do anything like that..  

Alam idaneem!!  

Ram,Ram.
