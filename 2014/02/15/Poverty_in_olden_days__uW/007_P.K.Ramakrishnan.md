A member has raised a point about akshara-sloka. This is a game practised mostly in Kerala.

  

A person recites a slokam in Sanskrit or Malayalam. Then the next person sitting on his left has to recite another slokam starting with the frist letter of the third line of the slokam just recited. If the next person does not do so he has to resign himself and the next person gets a

chance. When the second sloka is recited the next person has to recite another slokam starting with the letter of the third line. This goes on until one member who is not dismissed gets the first price.
