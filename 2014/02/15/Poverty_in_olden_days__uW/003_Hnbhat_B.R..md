Here is the चाटु in the orignal collections: in Mahasubhashita-sangraha and Subhashita-ratna-bhandagara-sangraha:

  

  

२६४७-१ अयं पटो मे पितुरङ्गभूषणं पितामहाद्यैरुपभुक्तयौवनः ।

२६४७-२ अलंकरिष्यत्यथ पुत्रपौत्रकान्मयाधुना पुष्पवदेव धार्यते ।।

  

It is quoted among the jokeful verses, which is considered for as हास्यरसः by ancient Rasika-s.

  

Here the reading कक्षपुटेन धार्यते doesn't explicitly give any meaning, but unusable, but paternal inheritance. The same with the other reading पुष्पवदेव धार्यते also suggests the same thing. Only to enjoy such verses, one need to have sense of humour. Totally it suggests the poverty of the poet or the speaker, but proud of his heritage. conceals his poverty in his oratorship.
