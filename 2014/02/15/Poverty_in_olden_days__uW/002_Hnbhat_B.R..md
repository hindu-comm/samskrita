Dear Narendra,

  

Thanks for notifying the grammatical error in the first line itself. If you like the pathos reflected in the verse, you could have suggested the correct reading,'

  

"भूषणम्"

  

which you could have found by googling for the verse.

When you read the corrected first line, the second line gives the idea very cleanly.

  

पितामहाद्यैरुपभुक्तयौवनं पितुरङ्गभूषणमयं पटः, which makes the expression clear, This cloth, which had its freshness used by my grand father, which is the adornement of my father also,

Here it is alright with your assumption. It had become by the time of the poet, it had become torn out, so that it could not be used for covering the body, but only carried as the inherited property, as fashion.

Thanks for the comment and analysis. It is in the Mahasubhashitasangraha. and our friend Ramakrishnan who is a "rasika" enjoyed it, like the poet without bothering about grammatical analysis.

  

चाटुश्लोक-s need not be a full fledged काव्य, like रामायणम्, शाकुन्तलम्, मेघदूतम्, or भट्टिकाव्य, माघकाव्य, or नैषधकाव्य which is considered as विद्वदौषधम्। They can just bits of joke, pathose, love or anything the poet enjoyed and want to share his enjoyment with his readers. Only one should be a रसिक सहृदय first. and the first quality for a रसिक and कवि is not scholarship, but भावयित्री प्रतिभा for रसिक and the same कारयित्री प्रतिभा in the poet. When one can share the same feeling as the poet, by his भावयित्री प्रतिभा, he his called a सहृदय. This is the decision of काव्यमीमांसा.

  

Your analysis made me remember

  

"नीवीविस्रंसवेलायां मूल्यं पृच्छन्ति वाससः।"

  

and also the remark of कविसहृदयचक्रवर्ती ---

  

शब्दार्थशासनज्ञानमात्रेणैव न वेद्यते ।

वेद्यते स तु काव्यार्थतत्त्वज्ञैरेव केवलम् ॥ १.७ ॥

  

who maintains ध्वनि is the essence of the poetry.

  

Thanks.
