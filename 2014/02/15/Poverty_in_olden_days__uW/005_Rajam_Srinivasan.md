I hope this is the appropriate context to make an inquiry-- what are "akshara shlokaas?" Is there any references on or off line that I can use. I found this item offered as the final piece in a program-brochure of some Samskrutam conference. "Akshara Shlokas -- in Sanskit and Manipravalam" -- 3:45 pm - 4:15 pm. The location of the conference is probably Kerala iin southern part of India. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you kindly.

  

Warm regards,

  

Iyengar
