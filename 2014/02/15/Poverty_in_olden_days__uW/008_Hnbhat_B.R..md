There is no problem with the usage.

  

Just like:

  

धीराणां भूषणं विद्या मन्त्रिणां भूषणं नृपः ।

भूषणं च पतिः स्त्रीणां शीलं सर्वस्य भूषणम् ॥

  

or

  

विद्याकैरवकौमुदीं श्रुतिशिरः सीमन्तमुक्तामणिं दारान् पद्मभुवस्त्रिलोकजननीं वन्दे गिरां देवताम् ।

  

where देवताम्, is in feminine gender, which is qualified by कौमुदी which is in feminine gender, and मुक्तामणि is in masculine gender, and further दारान् is in masculine gender and plural, related to पद्मभुवः = the wife of Brahma, and देवता is always in feminine, and जननीं is always in feminine.

  

There is no confusion. रामस्य सीता भार्या, कलत्रम्, दाराः भवति. Any word would mean wife. and the gender won't change.
