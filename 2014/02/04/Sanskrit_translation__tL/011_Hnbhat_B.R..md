The above contains English Translation of Rigveda text only and the translation of Sayana, explained and translated word by word in Kannada language and not in English.

  

And the same member had already requested for the translation of the commentary long ago and replied also. Now this is the second time he has raised the same question. And he may well try to get the Translation of Peterson as mentioned by Mr.Adolf, if it is still available. Or he may himself read the Sayana's commentary on the verse 1.50 strictly following the text of the commentary to understand the idea of Sayana, than translations.
