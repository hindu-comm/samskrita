In a Marathi Group of which I am a member, this very topic was discussed in a thread that I had myself started. Those who can read Marathi can see it [here](http://www.aisiakshare.com/node/1790). If necessary I shall write here a translation thereof here if need be.

  

In the meantime, those interested may refer to Dr Subhash Kak's paper on the same topic available [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9804020.pdf) .

  

The long and short of it is that we may not rush into the conclusion that our ancient seers had arrived at any understanding of the speed of light through their supposedदिव्यदृष्टि!
