Hello,Hnbhat B.R!

  

I was able to find english translation of Sanskrit verses only. No translations of commentary were available in english.

I am interested in translation of whole 13 verses of Rig-veda 1.50 (translation of sanskrit text andcommentary). I would like to understand Sayana's thought process. I am ready to pay for this job. Are you interested?

  

Please don’t bring up the discussion about "rays of light” or else please. Just translation please.

  

Thank you very much!
