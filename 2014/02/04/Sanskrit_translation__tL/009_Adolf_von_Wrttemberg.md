I know that this does not specifically help you but you may be interested that the Vedic scholar, Dr. Saraswati Bali, published an English translation of सायण’s “Introduction to the Rig Veda” in 1999. The book’s whole title (in ITRANS transliteration) is SaayaNa’s Upodghnaata to the Taittiriiya saMhitaa and the RRigveda SaMhitaa. The publisher is Pratibha Prakashan in Delhi and the ISBN Number is 81-7702-012-9. She and her proofreaders did an excellent job with the book; it has very few typographical errors.



Note 1: Those who wish to develop and/or polish their skills in reading Sanskrit commentary may find this book useful.

Note 2: Over a hundred years ago a guy named Peterson translated SaayaNa’s commentary on the RRigveda but it was poorly done since he didn’t appear to understand much about Indian culture. I long ago archived his book on one of my distant dark bookshelves!

I don't think there is any English Translation Sayana's commentary. I have not heard of. There are English translations of Rigveda available by different writers.
