What is it that prevents us from attaining the fullness of realisation, or attaining the lofty heights of perception, knowledge and conduct that our Jinas {fordmakers} assure us we are capable of achieving? What holds us back from experiencing the transcendental bliss that only the supremely detached ones constantly and endlessly enjoy?

The answer is: Delusion. Caused by a flawed understanding of reality and exacerbated by the upswing of passion and desire, delusion keeps us from reaching the pristine transcendental state of the soul where all attachments are shed and the soul, immersed completely in itself, is completely at peace.

How then, one may ask, does one get rid of delusion? This text answers this question unequivocally. It offers a clear understanding of the vastness of true reality and provides many glimpses of the right path. It demonstrates how we can rid ourselves of delusion and steer clear of the passions and desires that hit us from all sides. It shows us the path of liberation and what we must do to see the true path, know the true path and walk the true path. This is also the reason that I translated this text into English, in order to make it accessible to the English-speaking world.

I would like to convey my gratitude to the Jinas, to the Jain faith and to all the Jain seers in the world. I would especially like to thank Ācārya Padmanandi for composing this beautiful Sanskrit text of 51 verses, and Ācārya Kalyāṇabodhi for his bringing to light this beautiful text and making it available to me. Without him, I would have remained unaware of its existence.

I bow my head in deep gratitude to the enlightened Jinas who attained liberation themselves and showed the path of apotheosis to all.
