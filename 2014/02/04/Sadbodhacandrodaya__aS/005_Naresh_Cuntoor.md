I don't disagree.  
  

Sri Manish Modi - perhaps you could post a list of new publications in one email (say, once a month) so that it still remains informative without becoming an overwhelming advertisement.  
  

May I request members to hold further discussions on whether or not such posts should be allowed? Many of you have written chiming one way or the other.
