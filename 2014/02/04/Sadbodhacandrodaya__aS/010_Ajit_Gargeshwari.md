Publication details about books by authors themselves should always be welcomed.  

Say in a discussion I am discussing a bout Paninan grammar a publisher should not pose he is trying to give a view and say that for further details on Panini please buy our books  

In my opinion this may be a guide line it is for the moderators to decide.
