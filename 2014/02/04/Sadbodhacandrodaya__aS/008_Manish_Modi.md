Fair enough. But at this rate, it will take me several lifetimes to list all the books! We have over 4000 books in our bookstore.

  

And there are many thousands of Sanskrit books in the world. Even listing all of them on the net, in front of Sanskrit lovers, is a task by itself. It should be done.

  

Else, the Sanskrit market is drying up. It is a losing proposition to sell Sanskrit books. Other than government bodies, which are terribly hampered by bureaucracy, not many are working with Sanskrit books. All the fancy bookstore like Crossword, etc. deal in English literature. Hindi and Sanskrit get shafted.

  

It is essential for booklovers to support standalone bookstores who are struggling against the tide and specialising in Indological books. Trust me, it is not a commercial proposition. We have been doing this for the past four generations because it is our family crusade.

  

So please do not treat us like tv advertisers who advertise shampoo, soap and biscuits.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
