Sai ji,



I understand that the information from Manish ji is being considered advertising because it comes from a business house. But I feel there is nothing wrong in it. A business house like this is doing a great service to the mankind by publishing rare spiritual books and placing it in everyone’s hands. And for that if Manish ji wants something in exchange to run his household, what of it? I don’t think that makes the information on his services coloured in any way. Would you consider this to be in the same league as advertising an electronic gadget or some travel holiday? No, we are talking of Samskrita books, for which publishers are rare, and rarer still is a publisher who translates books himself. I am in awe that a business house like this is running since 1912. It needs great dedication and commitment. I am very happy to see all these beautiful books being published so that we all may benefit in life. I will be glad to continue receiving this info, as in my opinion, this is very much in line with promotion of Samskrita. But if the creators of this mailing list think this is not in line with the principles of the mailing list, then that is a different question.



Warm Regards

Sanjay
