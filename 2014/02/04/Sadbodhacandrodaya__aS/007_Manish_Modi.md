Dear Sanjay ji, Sai ji, Naresh ji and Ajit ji,

  

Is it possible to word it differently so that it works as a new book information service?

  

I can send a large mailer each month, but unless something is written about the book, people will not get to know anything from the title information.

  

I was planning to introduce one Sanskrit text each day. Perhaps I should reword it?

  

I shall send out something today worded differently. If members still do not like it, I shall not send it like that. I shall, instead, send one email a month with names only.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
