*But the site has not been working for a long time.*  

  

Tried for archives, older copies? They are kept scanned. They load slowly but do load. With same pleasure and feeling as a book, you can read them.<http://chandamama.com/archive/storyArchive.htm>

I do not know if its published now.

If Samskrtam learning is the purpose, please try other web-sources. Eg- <http://sanskrit.samskrutam.com/en.MainPage.ashx>

Let me know if you like it. Will come out with more.

Or try searching in Google with Devanagari Unicode with some Samskrtam words. You will find some good blogs and other interesting stuff. See results with some subhAshitas, shokas etc.

Hope this helps.
