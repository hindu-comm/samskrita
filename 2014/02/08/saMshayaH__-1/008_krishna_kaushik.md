I had subscribed to the sanskrit chandamama from 2008 to 2012

the copies were received with interruptions and sometimes issues went missing

phone calls usually resolved the matter but I did not renew the subscription due to the unreliability of delilvery



if they can improve the delivery of the publication, I am sure that many people would subsribe to it as this magazine can provide a lot of positive stimulation for kids and young learners (some of the older ones too)

Tried for archives, older copies? They are kept scanned. They load slowly but do load. With same pleasure and feeling as a book, you can read them.<http://chandamama.com/archive/storyArchive.htm>

I do not know if its published now.

If Samskrtam learning is the purpose, please try other web-sources. Eg- <http://sanskrit.samskrutam.com/en.MainPage.ashx>

Let me know if you like it. Will come out with more.

Or try searching in Google with Devanagari Unicode with some Samskrtam words. You will find some good blogs and other interesting stuff. See results with some subhAshitas, shokas etc.

Hope this helps.
