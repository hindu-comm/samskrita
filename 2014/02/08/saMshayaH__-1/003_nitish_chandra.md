But the site has not been working for a long time. It just has index without any stories. I get this message, when I try to read some stories.  
  
"Regrets!!  
Contents temporarily unavailable.  
Please try sometime later.  
  
Thanks for Visiting the site."  
  
But, I guess site development is still in progress because there was absolutely nothing (not even the names of stories) last month and now, there is at least something.
