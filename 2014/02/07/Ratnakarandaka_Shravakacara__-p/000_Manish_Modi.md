A feature of Jain scriptures is the importance accorded to the conduct of the laity. One of the first such works is acarya Samantabhadra's Ratnakarandaka Shravakacara. Written in the early centuries of the Common Era, it is an enduring masterpiece prescribing normative lay conduct.

  

If the Jain doctrine has survived for the past two millennia after the death of the last fordmaker Tirthankara Mahavira despite great socio-political upheavals and the fluctuating fortunes of the Jain community, credit should go to the innate correctness and relevance of the Tirthankaras' teachings of which the Ratnakarandaka Shravakacara is a splendid example.

  

The Ratnakarandaka Shravakacara occupies a special and revered place in the hierarchy of Jain scriptural tradition. It has been a defining authority on ideal Jain lay conduct for the past two millennia. Comprising of 150 shlokas, this work has ensured Samantabhadra's place in Jain history as it serves as an inspiration to Jains even today, more than two millennia after it was composed.

  

Since the study of the classical languages Sanskrit and Prakrit is not very prevalent in the Jain lay community today, the Jain community has largely learnt of the Ratnakarandaka Shravakacara through sermons by monks and lay scholars.

  

More than once, the Ratnakarandaka Shravakacara has been translated into Hindi in the 20th century. But there remained the need for an excellent scholarly English translation.

  

This translation is an attempt to rectify this situation. It is hoped that this book will revitalise the tradition svadhyaya by the members of the lay Jain community.

  

The Sanskrit term shravakacara means a compendium of rules for Jain householders. Jain laypersons are expected to carry out congregational and individual puja, fasting, and participate in rituals concerning atonement, pilgrimage and daily lustration and worship. It is believed that acarya Samantabhadra was a Jain saint who lived in Tamil Nadu. He wrote in chaste cultivated Sanskrit.

  

The Ratnakarandaka Shravakacara has five chapters. They shed light upon the three jewels - samyag-darshana, samyag-jnana and samyag-caritra and the minor vows taken by the Jain laity. It also discusses sallekhana and the eleven pratimas. Moral stories illustrate the doctrinal points made by the author.

  

The Sanskrit text was published for the first time by the Sanatana Jain Granthamala (Mumbai:1905) and then along with the Sanskrit commentary by Jain Granth Ratnakar (Mumbai: 1906). Barrister Champat Rai Jain translated this text into English for the first time. (Arrah:1917). The accompanying Sanskrit commentary by acarya Prabhacandra was never translated into English. For the first time, Prof Dr Willem Bollée critically edited the text, and translated the text and commentary and provided copious notes to the text and commentary. In addition, he prepared an excellent and insightful glossary, index of names and subjects, two bibliographies and 5 well-researched appendices.
