Dear Prof. Kolhatkar;

  

I cannot help saying WOW, what a beautiful post. I have been lucky to discover a wonderful on-line source for History of Indian Mathematics -- a veritable treasure of 40 videos. Here is the reference:

  

<http://nptel.ac.in/courses> /111101080/

  

OR

  

<http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJTh>f31TNSQzuN7zqxe7HdRN

(Sorry, I don't know why these addresses didn't come in blue color)

  

I discovered the aforementioned two web-sites in: -- <http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/hinducivilization/conversations/messages/71281/>

  

I like to have some info on the following:--

  

1. Is there any on-line source for "Leelavathi" (an earlier math text) in any language?

2. Is there any compilation of "subhashitams" and/or "pahelikas" which are "number-related" or "alphabet-related?" Any of them on-liine?

3. I have the proper-name designations for the numbers from 10 to the power of 1 through to the 10 to the power of 17; is there any source to find out similar names for the numbers-- 10 to the power of 18 to the number--10 to the power of 23 or MORE!

  

The names from 10\*1 to 10\*17 are--dasha, shatam, sahasram, ayutam, laksham, niyutam, koti, arbudam, vrundam, kharvaha, nikharvaha, shankhaha, padma, sagaraha (jaladhi, samudra), antyam, madhyam, and parardham (for the number 1 followed by 17 zeros). Please correct these if you find an error.

  

Thank you very kindly,

  

Warmest regards

  

Iyengar
