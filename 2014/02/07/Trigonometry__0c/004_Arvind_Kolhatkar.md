It may be possible that the First Aryabhata was the first mathematician to create the concepts of sine and cosine that are basic to modern Trigonometry. The origin of this nomenclature can also be traced to him. It is also said that he developed this following upon the earlier Greek work on chords



In the attached picture the ratio BM / OB is called sin θ and the ratio OM / OB is called cos θ. In Hindu Mathematics these are called respectively as ज्या or जीवा and कोज्या or कोजीवा, the terminology being borrowed from the Bow. The length the line BM is smaller than the length of the chord BA but it is also seen that as the angle θ is made smaller, the difference between these two also goes on reducing.



If the angle of 90 degrees is divided into 24 equal parts, each part will be equal to 3.75 degrees. Aryabhata gives in दशगीतिका, the first part of आर्यभटीय, sine values of angles of 3.75 degrees, 7.50 degrees, 11.25 degrees and so on for 24 angles in the following code devised by him:



१.१२,१ मखि भकि फखि धखि णखि ञखि ङखि हस्झ स्ककि किष्ग श्घकि किघ्व।

१.१२.२ घ्लकि किग्र हक्य धकि किच स्ग झश ङ्व क्ल प्त फ छ कलार्धज्या:॥



This is explained briefly as follows:



मखि is म् ख् इ or 25, 2, 100. Consequently खि 200 and, by the rule of
’अङ्कानां वामतो गति:’ मखि is 225. भखि is भ् ख् इ किंवा 24, 2, 100 or 224. फखि is फ् ख् इ or 22, 2, 100 or 222. Further down, घ्लकि is घ् ल् क् इ, or 4, 50, 1, 100 or 154. All coded values in the above गीतिका should be thus worked out and written one below the other. Then create a series by the first number, then the first + the second, then the first + the second + the third and so on thill the end. the values thus emerging, viz. 225, 449, 671 are indicative of the sine values of the angles 3.75 degrees, 7.50 degrees, 11.25 degrees and so on. By modern calculation these are respectively 224.8560, 448.7490, 670.7205 etc., and are remarkable close to the values derived by Aryabhata. I call them 'indicative' because, when divided by 3438, the indicate the sine ratios of modern Trigonometry, such as 225 / 3438 = 0.06545 and sin angle 3.75 = 0.06540.



Aryabhata has also said:

२.१०.१ चतुरधिकं शतमष्टगुणं द्वाषष्टिस्तथा सहस्राणाम्।

२.१०.२ अयुतद्वयविष्कम्भस्यासन्नो वृत्तपरिणाह:॥



'Multiply 104 by 8 and add 62,000. This is the close measure of the circumference of the circle of which the diameter is 20,000. In other words π = 62832 / 20000 = 3.1416.'



Therefore, if a circle be drawn around the center 'O' with radius = 3438 units, its circumference will be (almost) equal to 21,600 units.
(3438\*2\*3.1416 = 21601.6416). if a polygon of 96 equal sides be inscribed in a circle, each side will create an angle of 3.75 degrees (360 / 96 = 3.75) and its corresponding chord BA in the accompanying figure will be 225 units (21600 / 96 = 225). The length BM will be (almost) equal to the chord BA. Therefore, sin angle BOA = BM / OB = 225 / 3438 = 0.06545, according to Aryabhata. According to modern calculation it is equal to 0.06540.



In Hindu Mathematics, the three sides of a right angled triangle are called भुज, कोटि (कोभुज) and कर्ण. While translating Aryabhata's ज्या or जीवा into Arabic, the translator wrote it as 'jiba' or just 'jb'.
(Semitic languages like Hebrew or Arabic, have the custom of dropping the vowels in writing. Also Arabic has little difference between व and ब.) When Gherardo of Cremona translated the Arabic text into Latin. he misread the Arabic 'jb' as 'jaib' meaning 'a fold in a cloth', for which he employed the equivalent Latin word 'sinus. This word took form root in later literature and got abbreviated into the modern short form 'sin'.
