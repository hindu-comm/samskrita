All,

  

Wiki (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus>)has it that

  

"[Alexander the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great")'s invasion of northern India brought Greek trigonometry, using the [chord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)"), to India where the sine, cosine, and tangent were conceived. Indian mathematicians gave a semi-rigorous method of differentiation of some trigonometric functions."

  

Would the source of this information be a Sanskrit document?
