Here is one rendition.

  

(When you are uncertain ofspellings, Google will offer you some alternatives).

  

  

Parvathi Swayamvara Dhyana Sloka  
  
Balarkayutha Suprabham Karathale Rolambamalakritham  
Malaam Sandhadhatheem Manohara Thanum Mandasmithodyanmukheem  
Mandam Mandamupeyushim Varayithum Shambhum Jaganmohinim  
Vande Deva Munindra Vanditha Padam Ishtarthadham Parvathim  
  
"O Thou who art resplendent with the radiance of the infant Sun,  
endowed with beauteous Form of immense charm, aalways with a pleasant  
and smiling face, Consort of the Lord, I pay by obeisances to Thee,  
who art respected by the Rishies of yore"!  
  
Swayamvara parvati Homam and Mangala Gauri Puja can be performed for  
removing obstacles in marriage. But more effective than a puja  
performed by somebody else on your behalf, is chanting the mantra  
yourself with full devotion and sincerety.

  

  

Best wishes.
