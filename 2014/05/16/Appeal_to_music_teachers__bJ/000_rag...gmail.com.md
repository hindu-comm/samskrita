Celebrating an achievement  
My father, Sri. G.Sampath, has been composing carnatic songs...writing the lyrics and setting them to music . His passion for composing started in 1970 with a song on Shri RamAnujAjacArya. Since then he has composed several more on various Vishnu stalas depicting different forms and stories of Sriman Narayana. The sahityam in Samskrtam brings out his deep devotion for the Lord and an understanding of the mahatmyam of these temples. He has compiled 31 of his kritis in a publication called Keerthana Mala. A few songs made it to an album but a lot more still remains to be unearthed. My mother Smt.Rajam Sampath, a music teacher herself, helped set the tunes and also sang some of them. Both my father and mother will really love it if you listen to these songs and more importantly, incorporate some of these into your music lessons, teaching young learners these modern classical compositions while at the same time introducing them to the glorious past of our culture. You can listen on YouTube at the links provided.
