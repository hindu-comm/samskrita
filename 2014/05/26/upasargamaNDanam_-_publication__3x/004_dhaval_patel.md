Dear scholars,

I checked up the whole issue. Right now the book as it is uploaded on kindle is the best solution I could find to display devanagari and diacritic both.

  

As for the issue of non-loading of sample text, I spend the whole day to find a way out of this issue of kindle.

  

The following is the method which I could find for looking the sample pages, which worked well for me.

  

1\. go to <http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1?ie=UTF8&docId=1000493771>

2\. Download the Kindle reader applicable to your device.

3\. go to<http://www.amazon.com/Upasargamandanam-Mandanamantri-treatise-Sanskrit-prefixes-ebook/dp/B00KK4FB4G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401299983&sr=8-1&keywords=upasarga+mandana#>

4\. On the right side panel, second panel will show "Send Sample Now" - Deliver to XYZ's Kindle for PC. Click on it.

5\. The sample will be loaded on your comp / tablet etc.

6\. Access the Kindle application and click on the downloaded sample.

7\. This will give you access to the sample pages offline also.

8\. As the book is quite bulky (130 MB), the samples also may be bulky. Please use your discretion for people who have limited net access.

9\. The display is shown rotated (landscape) on computer screen. For kindle devices, I think this should be no issue, because it might be used in landscape mode or held that way. (This rotation to landscape is not within my control. It is amazon's creation.)

  

Please find attached the sample page as it is seen on my kindle for PC application.
