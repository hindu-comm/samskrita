Respected sir,

Sorry for the ambiguity.  

By 'the first' word I intended the oldest.

The book was composed in 1435-1436 A.D.

The rest of upasarga related works which have come down to us don't give verb wise upasarga. They usually take an upasarga and give meanings with different roots.

The comprehensive work upasargArthacandrikA of Mr. CArudeva zAstrI also came in late 19th century most probably.

So, just wanted to convey its oldness. That's it.

Thank you very much.
