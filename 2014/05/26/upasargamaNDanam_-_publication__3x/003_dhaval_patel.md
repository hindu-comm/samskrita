Respected sir,

I checked up the issue.

Kindle has transposed the orientation of book, which has resulted in wrong display of book.

As kindle per se doesn't support native devanagari fonts, I had used the PDF format which has some compatibility.

This resulted in original file being around 20 MBs.

Kindle converted it to its own format - which came to whopping 130 MB for reasons unknown.

So the large file size and transposition of orientation have occurred while conversion to the kindle version.

I apologize for the same and request the interested readers to please withhold your orders till I can find a way to correct this technical issue please.

I will keep the group posted whenever I get a way out of this issue.
