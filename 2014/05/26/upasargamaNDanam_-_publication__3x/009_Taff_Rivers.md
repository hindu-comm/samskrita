**I can't determine the originof yourquote: "**This is made available in the software gaNakASTAdhyAyii."

  

However, if you are referring to such as these *(see below*), they areencoded in various proprietary *Taralabalu* legacy fonts.

You can search for, and install those fonts so that they become readable.

Otherwiseconvert the files to Unicode, for your own, private use, I have done.



Anyway, you can always download the ***Ganakastadhyayi*** software package itself toview/search roots & upasargas offline.
