Namaste

Before you get books of your choice, may be this will help you-

On Vishnu Sahasra nama stotra.

A good one- very serious Samskrt commentary, edited in modern way.

Very useful work.. And much more in the end. I had downloaded it from [archive.org](http://archive.org). (Attaching book directly instead of link. With due Thanks to archive people)

All the best.
