Hello All,

For a long time I have been searching for Sanskrit books in Bangalore with *vyakhya* in Sanskrit, as opposed to English translations. The ones that I found in Vedanta are either of very poor quality print(one or two I found were unreadable, especially *Mallinaatha's vyakhyas*) or there weren't enough such books when I visited. I am sure I haven't checked the store thoroughly; So, can someone please help me with the actual name of the publishers and the store(s) where the said booksmight be available?

  

I am looking for Valmiki RaamayaNa(a friend of mine had hardcover with blue dust jacket), Complete works of KaLidaasa and BaaNa's Kaadambari to start with.

  

Thanks,

Varun
