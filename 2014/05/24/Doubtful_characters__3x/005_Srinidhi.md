These are forms of Jainanagari script or Jain nagari , a script derived from Nagari group of Brahmic family.It is often considered as a variant of Devanagari .

It was primarily used in Western India, present-day states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It has a unique calligraphic style in which manuscripts contain several illustrated paintings.Here, the script is mixture of Devanagari and Jainanagari characters.

Some letters are similar to Devanagari, While vowels, many consonants, conjuncts and digits are completely different.

The main languages are Sanskrit and Prakrit.

It uses Prishtamatra e, a variant of vowel sign 'e' which is written left of the consonant.

I'm not a native user, But I can identify some Characters.

Some of the characters I can identify letters based on my research on some Jainanagari manuscripts.

I'm listing which are correct. I'm not doing any assumption here.

1)kṣaक्ष 

2 & 3) it is a vowel sign of u attached to some consonant.

4)bhū

5\) It is उ-u as in upari which means above

7\) It is DA -ड .This sign normally used in Marvari, Kutchi languages etc.

8\) It is jna-ज्ञ

11\) It is Chha -छ

13\) it is ठ

14\) ddha-द्ध

16\) ddhya

Can you please send me original book and its origin, date.

And material and attestations printed in Jainanagari script.

if needed i can send book in jainanagari on its alphabet.
