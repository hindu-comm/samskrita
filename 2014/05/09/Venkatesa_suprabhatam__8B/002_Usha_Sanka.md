Namaste

Here are some web-resources -

  

Plain text-

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/venkatsp_sa.html>  

  

Transliteration and meaning-

<http://shravanmanyam.blogspot.in/2013/12/shri-venkateshwara-suprabhatam-video.html>  

<http://swayamvaraparvathi.org/tag/venkatesa-suprbhatham-sanskrit-english-meaning/>  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprabhatam>  

  

(Please ignore if already aware)

  

I had tried for any word-to-word meaning resource in web. But could not get it.  

Please kindly inform here if anyone did it before.. in book or anywhere else.

Otherwise someone can try it out for everyone's use.
