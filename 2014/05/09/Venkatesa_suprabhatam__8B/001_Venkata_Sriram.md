Namaste,



The popular AryOkti is "nAn rishiH kurutE kAvyaM". A "kavi" with his "bhAvukata" envisions a tattva with the help of his mental eye. After he gets "rasAnubhUti", he composes these sort of bhakti kAvyAs.



The audience / reader of the kAvya has to tap this "rasa". If the rasa experienced by all the three ie., the nAyaka of the kAvya (hero), kavi and the pATaka / shrOta reaches the climax, all three experience the same advaita-bhAva.



Venkateshwara Suprabhatam is one such marvellous piece of composition by Prativadibhayankara Annangacharya who enables us to mentally visualize the srivigraha of srinivasa perumal.



The early morning (brahma-muhurta) scene is described which is soothing to the mind if imagined.



regs,

sriram
