What is the significance of Sri Venkatesa Suprabhatam in terms of its beautiful Samskrita? It is so rhythmic and melodious to listen any number of times. The words used are in such coordination that it easily enters the heart.

  

I would like to know more on the construction of this wonderful Suprabhatam (with stotra, prapatti, mangalaasasanam).

  

Regards,

Srikanth
