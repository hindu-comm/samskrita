All,

  

I have noticed that the English-Sanskrit companionto the Sanskrit-English MW has recently (2013) put in an appearance at IITS Koeln.

This electronic version is something I have sorely neededfor a decade or two, asthe Sanskṛt in these raw data files is in the IAST format, therefore is easily converted into Romanised Sanskrit

and therefore readable to the Devanāgarī challenged likemyself.

  

However, the interface to the data is viathe included Apache server...

  

Has anyone managed to untangle the Directory structure/ Configuration file parameters for the included Apache server, to run it locally (localhost mode) on their Windows desktop?

  

i.e. item 6. on their website...
