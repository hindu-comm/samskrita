Thanks guys,

  

 Since posting,Ialso had your idea of first trying toinstall Apache, then separately adding those MW data files.

  

I tried using the Win64 binaries from <http://www.apachelounge.com/download/>and they work a treat.

  

(OK.there were local problems withpermissions forport 80, because IIS had grabbed it, but that's par for the course.)

  

  

Now to give it a whirl...
