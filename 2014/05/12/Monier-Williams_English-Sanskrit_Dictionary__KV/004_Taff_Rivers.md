Dr,

  

 The first hurdle with Apache is achieved, but there's a snag with the Sanskrit data files, they're not .html, but .php & .js- and those scripts don't work, they are somewhat buggy...

  

All I need is the that MW in a editable form.I have'front end' software to search & edit, copy & paste etc.
