Yes, that's the screen I am seeing, but where there should beword lists and word definitions,I'm seeing raw stuff like this:

  

==>

"; echo "$meta\\n"; //\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* $nxmlnew=0; $key; $prevkey=""; $n = -1; $matches = array(); $noLit="off"; $noParen="off"; $ntab = 0; // remove escaped \\". For some reason, these are being inserted by // the 'print' statement in mwquery_gatherMW.php $data = preg_replace('/\\\\\\\\"/','"',$data); // the '/s' is to skip over \\n. preg_match_all('/.\*?(.\*?)\<\\/key1>.\*?\<\\/H.\*?>/s',$data,$matchall);

\<==

  

  

I'm extracting thedownload to hard disk,

manually copying the 'web' directoriesover to my Apache server, underneath 'htdocs', as per the readme.

I don't see any xampp stuff though.

  

  

The other MW download, of the Sanskrit-English MWis an exeunlike this English-Sanskritpackage.That one runs a treat, right out of the box, but this one....

  

Thanks forthe confirmationthat it does work.
