Download Xampp from here  
<https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html>  
Install it.  
You may need to learn it's basics. Use xampp help or Google for tutorials to make it safe.  
Then you have to just copy the extracted dictionary to htdocs folder.  
Then you will be able to access the dictionary at localhost/(the name of folder) in your web browser.  
  
But, if it appears difficult, please choose a dictionary software as Golden Dict and put stardict files of MW Dictionary to it's respective folder and enjoy.
