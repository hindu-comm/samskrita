**I've been using the sanskrit-lexicon of the University of Koeln since it first came online.**

**Two versions are available to use.**

**The old one, I find, is easier to use when ambiguous words like \<Adya> and \<adya>.**

**The old one is not case-sensitive.**

**If you do not use the Harvard-Kyoto transcription,**

**the new one will suit you very well.**

**And the display is much more beautiful,**

**which I call a Good Thing.**
