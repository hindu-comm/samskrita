Murthy,

  

 You will need a .pdf reader withbuilt-in page navigation features.

  

Open *mwe_bookmark.pdf* withthe free *Adobe Reader,* for example.

  

Get it from<http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/>if you don't have it already.

  

  

I must say that the quality ofthosescanned pages is pretty good, butmyself, Ineed tohave the same functionality as I do fromthe downloading of the Sanskrit-English MW

(Windows.exe from <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/download.html>).

  

That one worksfine foe me, right out of the box!

  

  

 Taff
