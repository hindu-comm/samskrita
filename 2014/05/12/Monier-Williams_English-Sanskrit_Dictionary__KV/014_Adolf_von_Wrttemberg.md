प्रिय Murthy Ji,

The following website:

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>

has many revisions and additions now. I’ve used it on computer operating systems ranging from Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 up to my current version of Windows 8.1 Update. It is the easiest to use Sanskrit dictionary portal that I know of. I’ve always found it a real pain to deal with those Apache servers when all that I need is the website above. However, it may fulfill other needs that you have.

विष्णुः

P.S. The website’s location, viz. Köln, Germany, is where I lived as a university student back in the 1960s.



Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick  
themselves up and hurry off as if nothing happened.  
Churchill, Winston (1874 – 1965)
