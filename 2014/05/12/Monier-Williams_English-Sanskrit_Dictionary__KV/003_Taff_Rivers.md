श्रीमल्ललितालालितः

  

  

As, reported I have Apache (Apache Win64) set up, however, thosedata files of the English-Sanskrit MW are php's and their javascript files look like they've not been tested - they have errors, so the Sanskrit dictionaries areinaccessible.

  

All I really need is theMW content with the Sanskrit in its Romanised form. Whereby I canfully search anywhere in the content, for any string of characters,not just by headwords.

The downloads on offer are all in Harvard-Kyotougliness, which I'm having to convert to diacritics, myself.

Those JS files should do that, but don't - I'll try to contact those .PHP and.JS programmers.

  

As for 'stardict', yes, that's a useful piece of software.

But,the 'revered' Sanskrit dictionary available there, is simply the main Sanskrit-English MW, with the option having all of its Sanskrit display, not in Roman but in the Devanagari script-somewhat misleading, as its nothing to do with the Companion English-Sanskrit Volume!

  

So, its back to the drawing board...
