Murphy,

  

 You're underthe Monier-Williams topic.

  

However, did you obtain the Apte from [http://www.aupasana.com/stardict](http://www.aupasana.com/stardict)?

  

The skt-eng stardict tar.gzand the bi-directional version both extract OK.

Iam able to access them on my Desktop (Windows 8.1) from within the "[*32-bit Windows installer*](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/goldendict/GoldenDict-1.0.1-1-Install.exe)" version of the GoldenDict app.from [http://goldendict.org/download.php](http://goldendict.org/download.php).
