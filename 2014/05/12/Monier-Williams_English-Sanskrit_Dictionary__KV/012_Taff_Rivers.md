Dr,

  

==>

Did you go to xampp control panel and activate apache and other options ?

==>

  

Thepost showing xampp-portable directory structures etc. is from another member, showing his setup - its not even for the mweweb1.

Only the post showing the code, is mine,

  

Whatever.I havecontacted theauthor of this (mweweb1)software whokindly provideda solution to my problem viavideo tutorial.

(I needed to download different packages, and most importantly, change a configuration file - [pms-config.in](http://pms-config.in/)).

  

Anyone who is interestedininstalling mweweb1 on a desktop hard disk, canviewJim Funderburk's video tutorial here:

PS.

 The video showsthedownloading oftwo particular packages - the MW package, and one of theserver2go packages that is required by, but -not- included inthat MW package.

The particular server2godownload includes a32 bit version of Apache.  

Other combinations may also work -I haven't triedothers such as the portable versions, only thishard diskdesktop version.
