Dear All,

I had successfully installed Stardict for Sanskrit on my Windows XP machine using guidelines given at [aupasana.com](http://aupasana.com). When I try to install it afresh on my new Windows 7 PC, by downloading stardict and tar.gz files for Apte Sanskrit dictionary, while unzipping the latter I get an error message. I would be obliged for any guidance from scholars who might have successfully installed the set on Windows 7 machine.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
