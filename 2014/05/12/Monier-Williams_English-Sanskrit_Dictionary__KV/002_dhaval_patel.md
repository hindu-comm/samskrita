1\. Install XAMPP -> locate XAMPP folder (mostly in C: ) -> Open htdocs folder -> Put your content in this htdocs folder.

2\. Then start xampp control panel -> start all the services, most important being apache.

3\. Then go to browser of your choice.

4\. If your files are in xampp/htdocs/sanskrit folder, and filename is abc.html, type localhost/sanskrit/abc.html. (location upto htdocs folder is understood by localhost).  

5\. Now it will work as if you are accessing a server. your comp will work as a server.
