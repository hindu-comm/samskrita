Gentlemen,

  

Online data resources arejust fine- as long as youare within yourdownload limitor pay the extra forunlimited access.

  

The latest koeln is indeed a splendid online resource.

  

However,whilst the offline desktop Apte dictionary does requireanapplication to access it, it a normal windows executable, though with advanced facilities for dictionary lookups.The dictionaries themselves may be online and or offline.

  

NoServer, Apache or otherwiseis needed.

  

 Taff Rivers.
