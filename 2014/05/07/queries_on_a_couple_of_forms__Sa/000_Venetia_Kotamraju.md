Namaste,

I would be very grateful if the scholars on this list could help me with the following queries:

\- is the ekavacana prathama purusha lang lakara form of pidhA (to close) प्यदधात्

\- is the dvivacana prathama purusha lang lakara form of Arabh (to start) आरभेताम्

\- if constructing a dvandva samasa, does a strilinga first member of the samasa retain its dirgha ikara or instead take a hrasva ikara - my example here is pautri-matamahi ('granddaughter and grandmother').
should it be पौत्रि-मातामही or पौत्री-मातामही

Thank you very much for your help

Venetia
