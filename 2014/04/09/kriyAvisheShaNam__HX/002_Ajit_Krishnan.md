namaste,

  

The example below comes from Charudeva Shastri's book "वाक्यमुक्तावली", where he says "पीडितम् यहाँ क्रिया विशेषण है". Given that he is an acclaimed pandita,I think it's safe to treat his explanation as an authoritative statement :-)

  

In either case, my questions (though they were rooted in this example) are more general in nature.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
