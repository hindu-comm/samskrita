Harry,

  

Here are the particulars of MR Yardi's book:

  

The Ramayana, Its Origin and Growth, a Statistical Study

Bhandarkar Oriental Series, No.26

Published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, 411004 India

1994

  

I went through the article of MM PV Kane that you have so kindly attached. The learned author has said that the version of Ramayana used by Kalidasa apparently did not lay down the planetary positions at the time of Rama's birth. But even he has not touched upon the impossibility of laying down such a position by a contemporary observer in the absence of the availability of the relevant concepts and nomenclatures.

  

In a lighter tone, this is like inviting us to believe that Kalidasa inserted the plug of his laptop in the nearest wall outlet and happily typed away his Raghuvansha in MS Word!
