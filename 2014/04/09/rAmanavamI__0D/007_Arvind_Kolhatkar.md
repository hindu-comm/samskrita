I do not know about the copyright of the Vaidya's translation of Dixit's book. The translation is available on [scribd.com](http://scribd.com) and links to it are available in my first post in this thread. ( The post itself being somewhat long, it is being trimmed in the first view but can be fully expanded.) I give the links here again.
