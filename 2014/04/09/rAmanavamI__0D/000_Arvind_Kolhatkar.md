Dear Group,  

  

Today Ramanavami is being observed all over India, in celebration of the belief that Rama was born on the 9th tithi of the Shukla PakSha of Chaitra. I was wondering as to what would be the source of this belief and to satisfy my curiosity did some digging of relevant texts available on the Internet. The following is the summary of what I found.



The texts available on the internet appear to fall in two classes on this subject. In one class are those texts which, in Balakanda Sarga 18, give the following arrangement of heavenly bodies at the time of Rama's birth. This extract is taken from 'Ramayana of Valmiki' by Shastri Shrinivasa Katti Mudholkara and Satkari Mukhopadhyaya, 1983, Delhi available [here](https://archive.org/stream/ValmikiRamayana/Balakanda_I#page/n3/mode/2up).

  

ततो यज्ञे समाप्ते तु ऋतूनां षट् समत्ययुः \|

ततः च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ \|\| १-१८-८

नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु \|

ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह \|\| १-१८-९

  

The website <http://www.valmikiramayan.net> also has the same text.

  

['Translation of Ramayana'](https://archive.org/stream/Ramayana_201309/Ramayana-VOL-1-Bala-Ayodhya-Kanda#page/n59/mode/2up) by Manmatha Nath Dutt, Calcutta, 1894 translates this passage at p.49 is as under:

  

"And then when the six seasons had rolled away after the completion of the sacrifice, in the twelfth month, on the ninth lunar day, under the Punarvasu asterism, when the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Venus were at Arius, Capricorn, Libra, Cancer and Pisces, and when Jupiter had arisen with the Moon at Cancer, Kausalya gave birth to the lord of the universe..."



A text called 'Adhyatmaramayana' and its translation by Munilal, which appears to be an abridgement of the original Ramayana and which is printed by the Geeta Press, Gorakhpur, is available [here](https://archive.org/stream/AdhyatmaRamayana/GitaPress-AdhyatmaRamayan-Unabridged-Munilalsanskrit-hindi#page/n31/mode/2up) and says the following

  

मधुमासे सिते पक्षे नवम्यां कर्कटे शुभे।

पुनर्वस्वृक्षसहिते उच्चस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके॥

मेषं पूषणि संप्राप्ते... सर्ग ३, श्लोक १४,१५.

  

The English translation of Ramayana, by Ralph T.H.Griffith in [sacred-texts.com](http://sacred-texts.com) available [here](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry021.htm)

also echoes the above.

  

Tulasidasa's Ramacharitamanasa (source: Wikisource) gives similar details:



तबहिं रायँ प्रिय नारि बोलाईं। कौसल्यादि तहाँ चलि आई॥

अर्ध भाग कौसल्याहि दीन्हा। उभय भाग आधे कर कीन्हा॥

कैकेई कहँ नृप सो दयऊ। रह्यो सो उभय भाग पुनि भयऊ॥

कौसल्या कैकेई हाथ धरि। दीन्ह सुमित्रहि मन प्रसन्न करि॥

एहि बिधि गर्भसहित सब नारी। भईं हृदयँ हरषित सुख भारी॥

जा दिन तें हरि गर्भहिं आए। सकल लोक सुख संपति छाए॥

मंदिर महँ सब राजहिं रानी। सोभा सील तेज की खानीं॥

सुख जुत कछुक काल चलि गयऊ। जेहिं प्रभु प्रगट सो अवसर भयऊ॥

नौमी तिथि मधु मास पुनीता। सुकल पच्छ अभिजित हरिप्रीता॥

मध्यदिवस अति सीत न घामा। पावन काल लोक बिश्रामा॥

सीतल मंद सुरभि बह बाऊ। हरषित सुर संतन मन चाऊ॥

बन कुसुमित गिरिगन मनिआरा। स्त्रवहिं सकल सरिताऽमृतधारा॥

सो अवसर बिरंचि जब जाना। चले सकल सुर साजि बिमाना॥

गगन बिमल सकुल सुर जूथा। गावहिं गुन गंधर्ब बरूथा॥

बरषहिं सुमन सुअंजलि साजी। गहगहि गगन दुंदुभी बाजी॥

अस्तुति करहिं नाग मुनि देवा। बहुबिधि लावहिं निज निज सेवा॥



The other class of texts are those that do not specify any reference to the day or the time of Rama's birth or to the positions in the sky of heavenly bodies. The critical edition of Ramayana, prepared by the Baroda Oriental Institute, available [here](http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/ramayana/valmiki.htm)

has only the following:

  

कौसल्याजनयद्रामं दिव्यलक्षणसंयुतम्।

विष्णोरर्धंमहाभागं पुत्रमिक्ष्वाकुनन्दनम्॥६॥  
कौसल्या शुशुभे तेन पुत्रेणामिततेजसा।

यथा वरेण देवानामदितिर्व्रजपाणिना॥७॥

भरतो नाम कैकेय्यां जज्ञे सत्यपराक्रम:।

साक्षाद्विश्णोश्चतुर्भाग: सर्वै: समुदितो गुणै:॥९॥

अथ लक्ष्मणशत्रुघ्नौ सुमित्राजनयत्सुतौ।

वीरौ सर्वास्त्रकुशलौ विष्णोरर्धसमन्वितौ॥१०॥



The Sanskrit text of Sarga 17, Balakanda, available [here](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rys/rys1017.htm)in [sacred-texts.com](http://sacred-texts.com) also is the same as in the Critical Edition and does not refer to any time or date.



The question of how reliable are the astronomical observations mentioned in the epics was discussed in this Forum some months ago [in this thread.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/samskrita/astronomical%7Csort:relevance%7Cspell:true/samskrita/Hd_Xp7QZ3ZM/cjtt_7_eRw4J)I shall extract therefrom my own posting in it:



\<My problem with such calculation is the fact that according to experts the concept of Rashis was absent around the year 5114 BC. I consulted Shankar Balkrishna Dixit's authoritative Marathi book
भारतीयज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास (1896). After discussing the state of knowledge of Astronomy at the time of Vedanga Jyotishas and Mahabharata he has made the following observations on pp 97 and 113 in the Marathi book. Dixit's Marathi book has been translated into English by RV Vaidya under the auspices of the Meteorological Department of the Government of India and is digitally available at [www.scribd.com/doc/76777633/Bharatiya-Jyotish-Sastra-1](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76777633/Bharatiya-Jyotish-Sastra-1)‎ and [www.scribd.com/doc/76935732/Bharatiya-Jyotish-Sastra-2](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76935732/Bharatiya-Jyotish-Sastra-2)‎

‎Vaidya's V translation of these two passages is as under:



Mesha and other signs.



It does not mention any Rashis (signs) nor was the system of stating a planet's place with respect to 12 divisions of the ecliptic. The position of the sun and the moon are given with respect to the nakshatras.

(p.96. Vaidya translation)



Nowhere in the Mahabharata is found a single reference to Yoga, Karana, or Rashi. Had Rashis been in vogue at any stage of Mahabharata's compilation, they would certainly have come into the text. This definitely shows that the terms Aries (Mesha), Taurus (Vrishabha) etc. were not current in the age when the Mahabharata was compiled. In the same way it was not the system to mention a planet's position with reference to a part after dividing the ecliptic into 12 parts.
Everywhere in the Mahabharata we find the position of the moon and other planets with reference to stars.

(p. 147 Vaidya translation.)>



Taking into account all the above, I suggest that the commonly held belief that the birth of Rama took place on the 9th tithi of the Shukla Paksha of Chaitra owes its origin to a later-day interpolation of the relevant passage into Ramayana. Tulsidasa's adoption of that date lent further strength to this belief.



Before concluding, I wish to clarify that my intention here is not to enter into the thorny question of the historicity of Rama or of the Ramayana story. I only wish to understand the basis of the commonly-held belief about the date of birth of Rama.
