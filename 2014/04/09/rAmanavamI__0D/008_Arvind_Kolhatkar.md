I further notice that the trimmed portion also has my discussion of the contents of the Baroda critical edition of Ramayana and a link to it..
It is liable to be missed in the first quick reading.

  

It is worthwhile to note that the critical edition does not have these disputed verses and, in consequence, is not specific about anything beyond the mere fact of Rama's birth. The version of the critical edition too is given in my original post..
