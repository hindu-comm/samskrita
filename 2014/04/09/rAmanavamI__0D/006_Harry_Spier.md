I think Arvind Kolhatkar is refering to Bharatiya Jyotish Sastra by Sankar Balakrishna Dikshit which is in the DLI in Marathi. There is an english translation of this by R. V. Vaidya. This is also listed as in the DLI but I'm not sure it can be downloaded because it is still in copyright. I have a copy of this translation.And SB Dikshits book is superb in both the details it goes into and the great period of time it surveys.
