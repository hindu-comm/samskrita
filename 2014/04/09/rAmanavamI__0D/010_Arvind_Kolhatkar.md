Shripadji,

  

The problem, common to Ramayana and Mahabharata is that neither of these two epics are contemporaneous with the events they describe. Ramayana was not being written during Rama's life nor was Mahabharata composed as those events were unfolding. Both composition have been put together after much time - countable in centuries- had elapsed since those events took place and till that time the events were present only in common memory.

  

To muddy the water further, neither Ramayana nor Mahabhatara was composed by one poet in one continuous act of composing. Additions and interpolations have been made into them by writers who are nameless today. At the very start of Adiparva, we are told that Soota narrated the course of events after they had taken place quite some time before.

  

Because of this, whenever a precise and verifiable statement is made about anything, readers start looking for other evidence to double-check those statements with the assistance of other evidence.

  

Attempts have been made to identify the later additions. For example, MR Yardi, under the auspices of BORI, conducted statistical analyses of both the epics in an attempt to separate contributions of different authors into the these text and the periods of such addition.
