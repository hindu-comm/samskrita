1\) Dear Arvindji can you give the bibliographic information (title or journal etc.) for the book or article by MR Yardi you mention."  

  

2) In agreement with what Arvind Kolhatkar has said: attached is the article by PV Kane on Ramas horoscope and the Ramayana. Among other things he states: "Another important detail to be noted is that in the Raghuvamsa (Sarga III. I3) Kalidasa tells us that Rama's ancestor Raghu was born when five planets were ascendant (ucca) and were not too near the Sun (i.e. there was no asta in the case of the five). But in describing the birth of Rama, Kalidasa omits all astrological details (in Sarga 10.66) and makes a colourless statement. One expects that Kalidasa should have referred to the horoscope of Rama at least in the same terms as that of Raghu if he had the present text of the Ramayana before him. In serveral places there is a variance between the statements of Kalidasa and the statements in the Ramayana (vide for example Mallinatha's comment on Raghu.-10.1 and 56). It is, therefore, possible to argue that Kalidasa (who expressly mentions the Ramayana of Valmiki in Raghu --15.63) had a somewhat different text of that great poem. before him."
