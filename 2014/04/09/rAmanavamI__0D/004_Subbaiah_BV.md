I'm not sure what the confusion is here..  
  
कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह \|\| १-१८-९ --- this itself is a proof that, raashi - nomenclature is used during Ramayana period... Karkata- is the 4th raashi..  
  

And, Surya siddhanta, considered as Aarsha vaangmayam, is described to be narrated at the end of 28th Kritayuga, which elaborately discusses on Zodiacs..  
  

It's obvious that, Nakshatra reference is more accurate to describe the position of planets, than zodiac reference.. So, our ancient rishi's have carefully used Nakshatra / Rashi frame of reference, sothat they can describe more details within limited words.

नास्ति विद्यासमं चक्षुः, नास्ति सत्यसमं तपः ।  
नास्ति रागसमं दुःखं, नास्ति त्यागसमं सुखम् ॥  
There is no eye equal to knowledge; there is no penance parallel to truth;  
There is no pain akin to desire; there is no happiness synonymous to renunciation/sacrifice.
