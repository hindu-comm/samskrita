My own feeling is that PV Kane when he wrote this article was probably unaware of SB Dixit's conclusions that the astrological terminology was developed later than the original texts of the epics. But he noticed
other evidence that the passages with these astrological references are later additions and not part of the original Ramayana, such as the absence of Ramas horoscope in Raghuvamsa and his notes on the horoscopes of Ramas brothers. 

  

But whether PV Kane was aware of SB Dixit's arguments and conclusions or not. PV Kane's evidence about the astrological references in the Ramayana being later additions is important in order to avoid a circular argument about the dating of passages that contain astrological concepts. If part of SB Dixit's argument that the astrological concept and terminology of Rashi was not around when the epics were composed is that the term "Rashi" doesn't appear in the epics then you have to show that all references to "Rashi" in the epics are later additions and not part of the original epics and you have to use other arguments than "the term Rashi wasn't around when the original epics were composed".otherwise you just have a circular argument.

  

Thanks again,

My understanding of the article by PV Kane is that its a warning to the preparers of the critical edition of the Ramayana that the astrological references in the Ramayana are later editions and not part of the original text. His last paragraph is:

"These brief notes have been put forward with the sole object of bringing to the notice of the editors of the forthcoming edition of the Ramayana the necessity, in settling what the most likely original text was, of looking into ancient literature as well as into numerous MSS."

  

Thanks again,

Harry Spier
