The confusion is that as far as I see - and I may be corrected on this - in the very ancient period when Rama was born, our ancestors did not have the names of Rashis, Varas etc. I have quoted the respectable authority of SB Dixit who says so. Yet how is it that Rama's birth is associated with a specific Rashi etc.? How did such specific information about the planetary positions get transmitted over centuries and found itself in the Ramayana text in the absence of nomenclatures to describe it?
