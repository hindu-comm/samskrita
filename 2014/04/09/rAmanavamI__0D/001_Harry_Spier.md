page 84:

"It is stated in the Agastyasamhita that Rama was born at noon on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra, when Punarvasu asterism was occupied by the Moon and both the Moon and Jupiter were in conjunction and when five planets were in their ucca (exaltation), when the zodiacal sign rising on the eastern horizon was KarkaTaka (Cancer), and when the Sun was in the sign of MeSa (Aries).  
  
Note 214: These astrological details about the birth of Rama are in line with those in some editions of the Ramayana (except those of Gorresio and some others). Vid my paper on this in the Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, vol. I. pp. 1-5."
