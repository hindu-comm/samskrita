Dear Friends ,  
  
Navami Tithi , Nakshatra Punravasu , and Sun in Aries cannot happen simultaneously .  
  

Navami means moon / sun angle is between 96 to 108 degrees . In that case with Sun in Aries , the moon will be in Pushya nakshatra . Pushya nakshatra starts at 93.20 degrees . So for it to be navami the sun will have to be in Pisces , or the Nakshatra will have to be Pushya . So all these three things together are not possible .  
  

BUT  
  

This is when we are only taking our today's space time backwards with the assumption that everything else remained same or changed as per the constants that we are holding in the equations at present . That may not be the case .  
  

This does not consider the precession of the earth - or rather it considers it to be at constant speed .  

  

As per the TIFR study available here <http://web.tifr.res.in/~vahia/tithi-calculations.pdf>  

  

our calculations hold good till about 500 AD . As we go backwards , the actual tithi and the calculated tithi may be different by almost a week !  
  

So may be the panchang used then was different . That has some pauranik reference too . In nakshatra calculations earlier on Krittika used to be the first nakshatra and Bharani used to be the last and Abhijit was included . Now Abhijit is excluded , Ashvini is first and Revati is last . Earlier system makes sense as the devata for Krittika is Agni (the beginning shlokas of Ved also refer to Agni ) and the devata of Bharani is Yama . So we can safely say that we cannot reach the time line of Ramayana by the simple exercise of moving backwards in time .  
  

Now coming to Rashis not being mentioned in the literature . May be they were not in vogue . As of even today , most people remember Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti as March 1 or February 19 . Not many remember the Indian Tithi . Same may have been the case then . ( We are just 300 years down the line and so much of written literature exists , still this is the case . ) ( I am just theorising. ) As far as Dr. Dixit's work is concerned , I fully agree that it is extensive ; but need not be taken as the last word . The research tools at his disposal were limited and a lot more information has become available since then and tools have advanced so we need not consider what he said as to be the last word .
I believe if he were present he also would be busy adding to what he has already done. Please note that I am not making this statement flippantly . I am full of gratitude for the people like Dr. Dixit , and many others who spent their entire lives for this single purp0se .  
  

Think it like this . Lokmanya Tilak was a great mathematician . He wrote Orion and explained many of the Vedic phenomenon with celestial happenings . But he was doing all this in the shadow of Pandit Max Muller . So he had to fit everything in those 3000 years . In later dates when the Max Muller limitation was removed , a number of new theories came out .  

  

  

So yes , I agree with you when you say that the data does not fit , albeit for a different reason .  
  

Regards ,
