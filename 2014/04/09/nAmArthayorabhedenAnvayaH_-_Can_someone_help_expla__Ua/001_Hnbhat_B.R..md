As far as I know Alankara Shastra follows Mimamamsa Shastra, than Nyaya.

This is the position of the Naiyayika-s.

  

सम्बन्धः प्रकारान्तरेण द्विविधः भेदसम्बन्धः अभेदसम्बन्धश्चेति। आद्यः अभेदातिरिक्तसम्बन्धः अभेदसम्बन्धस्तादात्म्यसम्बन्धः\|  

  

That is how अभेद is called संसर्गः. identity of one and the other. It can भेदसंसर्ग and अभेदसंसर्ग which is identity or स्वरूपसंबन्धविशेषः।

  

This is accepted by नैयायिक-s in general. But is is not accepted by all others. One has to learn the niceties of such Nyaya-s or common maxims common for Shastra-s, which could not be translated in one or two words.

  

I think this is the context frequently resorted to in Rasagangadhara:

as given in the MimamsaNyayaKosha. The relationship between words and the referred things, पदार्थ, is the point of converging and diverging relationship discussed in Mimamsa, Nyaya and Alankarashastra. The above is the basis for the discussion in Rasagangadhara.
