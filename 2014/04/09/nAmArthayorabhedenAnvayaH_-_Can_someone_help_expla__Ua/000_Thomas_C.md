नामार्थयोरभेदेनान्वयः "Two nominals construe with each other by relation of identity". I've alternately seen it as "नामार्थयोरभेदसंसर्गः".  

  

This dictum gets cited in works on Alankarasastra from Jagannatha onwards with frequency. Can someone elucidate *exactly*what this means? I have an idea, but my guess is probably only half right.

  

This isn't from Panini; where does it come from? For whom outside Alankarasastra is it important? Navyanaiyayikas?

  

Any help would be most appreciated. Many thanks!
