Dear members  
  
In the following verse, the word "niyojya" seems to have as to meaning of a gerund, but the gerund of ni-juj is niyujya.  
Niyojya is also a noun, but its function in the vocative case does not seem to make sense.  
  
  

tannāmarūpacaritādisukīrtanānu

smṛtyoḥ krameṇa rasanāmanasī **niyojya** \|

tiṣṭhan vraje tadanurāgijanānugāmī

kālaṁ nayedakhilamityupadeśasāram \|\| 8 \|\|

  
Thanks for any help.
