I can give you some more input.

  

Actually, theर्‍ form ofर् is not special to me and is seen used in Sanskrit in writing words such as ग्रहण, क्रम, where it occurs after another consonant, the slight difference being that instead of looking like the half-moon, it is shown as slanted wedge-like line. Where it occurs before another consonant, it is shown as inआर्य, कर्म, धर्म.
This is so even where the consonant following isह as in बर्ह.

  

The same system is followed in Marathi for allतत्सम words. Thisर् is somewhat 'strong' in pronunciation. This 'strongness' is seen from the fact that sometimes you come across words likeसर्व and कर्म written as सर्व्व and कर्म्म.

  

Marathi needs a 'softer' variety ofर्in words likeवर्‍हाड and देणार्‍या.  To distinguish the 'soft'र् from the 'strongर्, theर्‍ formis employed.
