Thank you Arvindji for your answer. Also thank your for mentioning र्‍ह.  
  

Will you please also guide me, whether these got inserted into Marathi Devanagari from other languages, like Prakrit, or just got developed in Marathi by the usage of Marathi scholars? Also are there any more such usages in Marathi Devanagari which are not there in Sanskrit Devanagari?  
  

Thank you.  
  

J. Prasad.
