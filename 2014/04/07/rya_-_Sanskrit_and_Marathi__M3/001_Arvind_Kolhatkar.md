It is a peculiar case of Devanagari writing in Marathi. र् is written as र्‍ where it appears before य and ह in non-Sanskrit words. Examples are वर्‍हाड - marriage party or baraat,वर्‍हाड - the geographical entity Berar,देणार्‍या - one who is giving etc. However, if the word is Sanskrit in origin, र् is shown as in Sanskrit, namely asआर्य, कर्म, धर्म.

  

I think neither Hindi nor Nepali, both written in Devanagari, share this feature..
