Prasadji,

  

I really am no expert on Marathi orthography and cannot give a definitive answer to you question of how or when the र्‍ form ofर् got introduced into Marathi-Devanagari. I can, however, trace it backat least to 1805.

  

The first printed grammar of the Marathi language, called 'the Grammar of the Mahratta Language' written by Rev. Carey was printed at the Mission Press, Serampore in 1805. The script for Marathi used in it is the Devanagari. While nothing specific is said in it about writing compound words involvingर्, it does employ the standard form in वर्ग  
on p.2 and theर्‍ form when showing the case variations of the wordमिरे pepper as मिर्‍याने (by pepper), मिर्‍याहून (from pepper), मिर्‍यात (in pepper) on p.26. The Grammar went through (at least) three editions, the third coming out in 1825. In that edition, while Devanagari letters are shown at the beginning (because Devanagari was the script employed in writing any scholarly work), the emphasis later is on Modi (मोडी) letters, that being the cursive script more often used in business and political documents. Here too in the context ofमिरे the sameर्‍ form is used. Ballantine's Marathi Grammar printed in 1839 does the same on p.51.

  

Molesworth's authoritative 'A Dictionary of Murat,hee and English' was printed in June 1831. In showing the wordवर्‍हाड, it too employed theर्‍ form.
