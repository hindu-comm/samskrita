I think in Marathi language this word, 'ApaNa', may fit the bill:

  

  

आपण [(p. 070)](http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?page=38&table=molesworth&display=utf8) \[ āpaṇa \] *pron* (आत्मा S through अप्पा in बालभाषा) One's self. This is a representative or referential pronoun, standing indifferently for I, thou, he, we, ye, they; or for Myself, thyself, himself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves. Ex. म्यां त्याला जेवूं घातलें मग आ0 जेवायास बसलों; तू मला खटपटींत लावून आ0 स्वस्थ बसलास; त्यानें चोरी करावी आणि आ0 च चोर चोर म्हणून हाका मारीत सुटावें; and in this manner, through the plural.

  

2 In the style of majesty or magniloquence, आपण is assumed by the first person singular, bearing the plural significance and regimen of We; and in the reverential or respectful style, it is used in addressing the second person and in designating the third person singular, exercising the plural government of Ye and They, and conveying the force of such English phrases as Your majesty, Your honor, Your worship, His excellency, His highness &c.

  

3 आपण rather especially stands for No. 1, the first of the persons, for I or myself, or for We or ourselves. Ex. त्यापाशीं मागितलें असतां तो आपणास देईल.
