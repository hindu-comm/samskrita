In Marathi 'आपण' has this dual sense.

  

आम्ही जी भाषा बोलतो The language that we speak (here the reference is only 'ourselves' who speak that language).

आपण जी भाषा बोलतोThe language that we speak(here the reference is to 'us' and 'you' who speak that language).

  

(Additionally,आपण is also used as a pronoun indicating a higher degree of respect toward that person addressed.तुम्ही यावे is plain 'please come'', आपण यावे is more respectful 'may you please come'. However, this sense is not relevant to the question asked.)
