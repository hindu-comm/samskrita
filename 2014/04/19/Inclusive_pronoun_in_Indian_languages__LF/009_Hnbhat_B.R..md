Probably there is not such a distinction as I could not get the word "inclusive" in Turner's dictionary in any of the Sanskrit Pronouns. But only in the usage of Prakrit originated languages, including Gujarathi and Marati, the use of derivative of आत्मन् अप्पा, आप अप्पणा as already explained. There is a clear usage of vayam for both;

  

परस्परविवादे तु वयं पञ्च शतं च ते।

अन्यैः सह विवादे तु वयं पञ्चोत्तरं शतम्॥

  

already discussed in our group alrleady

With regards,
