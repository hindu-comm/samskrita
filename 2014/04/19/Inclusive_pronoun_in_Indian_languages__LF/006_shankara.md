Namaste!  
  
Thanks a lot to all scholars who responded to my query. From these replies I understand that languages like Kannada, Telugu, etc also have the exclusive/inclusive first person plural forms whereas languages like Marathi use the same pronoun in both contexts (exclusive as well as inclusive). One has to understand the meaning based on the context. Now, I would like to know if this is the case with Sanskrit too. For instance in the sentence वयं गच्छामः, do we have to recognize based on the context whether 'वयं' is inclusive or exclusive?  



regards  
shankara
