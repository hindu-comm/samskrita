Pranams to all scholars,

  

In Malayalam language, there is a special type of pronoun for first person plural. It is known as 'inclusive plural'. In Malayalam it is 'nammal'. Exclusive form of first person plural is 'njangal'.  

  

'nammal' includes the person/persons who is/are addressed to. It is not mere 'we', but 'we' plus 'the audience'.

  

I would like to know whether such inclusive pronouns are in use in Sanskrit and other Indian languages.

shankara
