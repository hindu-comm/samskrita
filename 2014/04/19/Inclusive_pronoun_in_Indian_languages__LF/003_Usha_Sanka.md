Namaste

In Telugu we have both- मेमु (మేము), मनमु (మనము)

मेमु - we all (not you/you all)

मनमु - we all (including you/you all)

  

मेमु भारतीयुलमु - (మేము భారతీయులము) - we are Indians (to outsiders/ non-Indians- who are excluded in "we")

मनमु भारतीयुलमु - (మనము భారతీయులము) we are Indians (to Indians- who are included in "we" )

Hope it helps.

Thankyou

-Usha
