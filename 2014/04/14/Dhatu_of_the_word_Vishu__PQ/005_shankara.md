Sir,  
  
Thank you very much for the explanation.  
  
I saw your reply only after sending my second mail, Please ignore that mail.  
  
The meaning of Vishu does have some connection with the Vishu festival. Vishu occurs on the Vernal equinox day when day and night are equal.  


regards  
shankara
