Pranams to all learned members,  
  
Vishu is a popular festival in Kerala. The word is originally from Sanskrit and is an avyaya. I would like to know how the word 'Vishu' is formed as per Sanskrit grammar. Is it formed from some dhatu? I could not find any info on this in all available dictionaries like Apte's, MW, etc. I request scholars to help me to understand this.  



regards  
shankara
