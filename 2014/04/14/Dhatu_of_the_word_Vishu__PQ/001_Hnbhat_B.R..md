I think you have to look in Malayalam Dictionaries and not in Sanskrit Dictionaries.

  

It is found in Comparative Dictionary of Dravidian Langauges of Turner:

  

1\. viṣuvánt : (page 693)

viṣuvánt ʻ supreme ʼ TS., m. ʻ a day in the middle of the year, a one-- day sacrifice ʼ AitBr., n. (m. lex.) ʻ equinox ʼ Yājñ., viṣuva-- n. (?) ʻ id. ʼ MBh. \[\*viṣu\] Pk. visuva-- n. ʻ equinox ʼ; WPah. (Joshi) *biśū m. ʻ the moment of the sun's reaching Aries, song sung by lowcaste people in April ʼ; A. bihu ʻ last day of Āśvina, Pauṣa, or Caitra observed as a festival, equinoctial festival ʼ. Addenda: viṣuvánt--: WPah.kṭg. bíśśu m*.

  

But not in the Sanskrit English Dictionaries the same meaning is given.

  

Apte's dictionary has got the information:

  

**विषु**viṣuविषु*ind.*1 In two equal parts, equally.-2 Differ- ently, variously.-3 Same, like.  

  

But meaning is different. The same with other dictionaries:

  

1 viSu 1 ind. (only in comp. and derivatives , prob. connected with %{vizva} accord. to Pa1n2. 6-4 , 77 Va1rtt. 1 Pat. a Ved. acc. %{viSvam} = %{viSuvam}) on both sides , in both directions \[998,1\] ; in various directions ; similarly , equally.

2 viSU = 1. %{viSu} above.

3 viSu 2 (3. %{su} ; only pf. p. A1. %{-suSvANa} with pass. meaning RV. ix , 101 , 11 ; accord. to Vop. also aor. %{vy-aSAvIt} ; fut. %{vi-soSyati} and %{vi-saviSyati}) , to press or squeeze out (the Soma plant for obtaining its juice).

4 viSU (2. %{sU} ; only impf. A1. %{vyasUyata}) , to bring forth (a child) Ba1lar.
