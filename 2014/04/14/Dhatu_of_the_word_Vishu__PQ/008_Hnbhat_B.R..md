Thanks Murthy for giving the meaning and derivation. Both the other words are derived from the same अव्यय विषु. meaning equality or equal parts, with the suffixes व and मतुप्

  

विषु = साम्यम्, अस्यास्तीति - विषु+व = विषुव.

"वप्रकरणे ऽन्येभ्यो ऽपि दृश्यते इति वक्तव्यम्।"(वा ५-२-१०९) in काशिका। But Mahabhashya lists only three wordsवप्रकरणे मणिहिरण्याभ्याम् उपसङ्ख्यानम् under the Sutra. मणिवः, हिरण्यवः only.and then extends its usage to other words:अपरः आह : वाप्रकरणे अन्येभ्यः अपि दृश्यते इति वक्तव्यम् । under which विषुव could be collected as suggested by Kashika.  

(neuter gender by usage). The same with विषुवत् - विषु+मतुप् - "संज्ञायाम्॥ ८।२।११" मो वः। विषुवत्। Literally it has the meaning the one having equal parts. According to context, the adjective can be related and the technical usage decides the meaning.

  

The usage of विषुवती संक्रान्तिः is found in गणितनाममाला. विषुव is not found. I am trying to look into it further whether विषु or विषुव is listed as technical terms in astronomy or astrology.
