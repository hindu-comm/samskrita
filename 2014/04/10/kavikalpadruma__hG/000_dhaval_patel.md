Respected scholars,  

I am searching for two missing pages (14-15) of the following book.  

  

**Kavikalpadruma of Vopadeva  
**

**Critically edited by G. B. Palsule,  
**

**Sources of Indo-Aryan lexicography : 15  
**

**Deccan college,  
**

**Pune, 1954.**  

  

I have tried DLI and archive. The versions available there have these pages missing.  

Thanks in advance
