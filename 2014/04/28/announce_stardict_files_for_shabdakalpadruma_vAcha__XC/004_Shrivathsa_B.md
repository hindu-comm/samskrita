hariH OM,  

shrii ajit,  
  

 I have been using the stardict dictionaries on your website since a long time now. The dictionaries are very easy to use. stardict is the simplest and most "no nonsense" platform for dictionaries. Your service to the sanskrit community is immense. I express my heart felt thanks to you.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
