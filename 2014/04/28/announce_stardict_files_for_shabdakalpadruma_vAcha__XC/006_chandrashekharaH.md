namaste,

Thank you Ajit Krishnan for this great effort, i also had been using from the time you made this available, amazing to see "bringing samskritam at finger tips".

I agree with SrimallalitalaalitaH that nyaayakoSha is worth developing because many samskritam students entering the language technicalitities needs nyaayakoSha.

I will be happy to assist if needed in this nyaayakoSha development.

sasneham,

chandrashekharaH
