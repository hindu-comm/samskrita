I'm using files created by you with recommended programs on my PC and Android since long. That helps me to find words, sUtra-s easily and fast.  

This addition will prove great gift for us. Thanks for taking pains to create these dictionaries.  

If possible, please consider creating a dictionary in this format for nyAyakoSha. nyAyakoSha is available on some website, where we can put devanAgarI words to get meaning.
