aatmiiyaaH,

In addition to the Apte and Monier-Williams dictionaries which were previously available, I've added the shabdakalpadruma and vAchaspatyam dictionaries in stardict format.

  

"Stardict" is a common dictionary format, and there are apps that can handle these files on almost every platform (eg. iOS, android). What this means is that you can download these files to your favorite device (eg. cell phone or tablet) and have these dictionaries available at your fingertips (no internet connection necessary).

  

The Apte and Monier-WIlliams dictionaries have already been available for some time and support for forward and reverse searches (i.e. skt->eng, eng->skt). The newly added shabda-kalpadruma and vAchaspatyam dictionaries support foward search only.

  

sasneham,
