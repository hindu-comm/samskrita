We need vocabulary for certain words of computer such as facebook, twitter etc .even scientific words ie in phycics ,chemistry

etc are known to those who studied in their mother tongue.all such wordsused in almost all indian laguages are only sanscrit

words .For example catalyst is known as uthprerakam etc.But computer field being new no words in compuer seems to

have been coined. It will be of help if sanscrit scholars coin these words and list them inspoken sanscrit dictionery

I'm using files created by you with recommended programs on my PC and Android since long. That helps me to find words, sUtra-s easily and fast.  

This addition will prove great gift for us. Thanks for taking pains to create these dictionaries.  

If possible, please consider creating a dictionary in this format for nyAyakoSha. nyAyakoSha is available on some website, where we can put devanAgarI words to get meaning.
