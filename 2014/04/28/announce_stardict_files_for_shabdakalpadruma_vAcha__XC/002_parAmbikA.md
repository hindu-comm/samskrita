Dear Ajit Krishnan ji,

Thanks for the shabda-kalpadrumaH and vAchaspatyam dictionaries and as shrimal-lalitAlAlitaH said we (atleast he and me) are using your other files since long on PC & Android, I'd also like to request **Upanishad vAkya KosaH** in stardict format if possible, it'd be very helpful for the students of Vedanta.

  

Thanking you once again for the wonderful files provided by you..

Parambika
