Respected members of the group;

  

Thank you kindly for all the wonderful and delightful information given in your posts. I need some info. One Mrs. Suman K Chiplunkar in her book on Mudras and Health, mentions that the Aksharas in Samskrita VarNamaala have very specific correlation to the parts of the human body. (Page. 236 in her book in Kannada "Mudra Vijnaana mattu Arogya), she mentions that a part of the Vedas called "Shiksha Shastra" gives scientific and beautiful explanation about,from which specific part of our body which particular "aakshara" originates/emerges/emanates!etc.

Where can I get info on that "Shiksha Shastra" either on line or off line.

  

Thank you very much
