All forms possible to derive from the root mentioned in the page. Check the first set of word रोचकः - रोचिका both are possible as adjectives to masculine and feminine genders.. And not as "rocika" as you have written. Either quote the line where you have encountered the word or write with IAST diacritic marks in roman unicode or using Devanagari Unicode fonts. Otherwise it is difficult to judge.
