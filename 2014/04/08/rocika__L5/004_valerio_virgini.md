From Śrī Upadeśāmṛtam by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī dāsa.  
  
The verse is the following:  
  
  

syāt kṛṣṇanāmacaritādisitāpyavidyā-

pittopataptarasanasya na rocikā nu \|

kintvādarādanudinaṁ khalu saiva juṣṭā

svādvī kramādbhavati tadgadamūlahantrī \|\| 7 \|\|  
  
  
In fact the word is *rocikā*.  
  
  
So is the feminine form of *rocaka*, right?  
  
  
Which is the text whose you have extracted this image?  
  
  
thank you very much
