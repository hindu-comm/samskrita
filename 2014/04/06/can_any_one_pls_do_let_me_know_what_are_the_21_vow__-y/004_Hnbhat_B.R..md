It is the same text I have quoted and enumerated the 21 types.



Only Sitharama missed the enumeration in two ways. सानुनासिक and निरनुनासिक varieties and उदात-अनुदात्त-स्वरित ARE not counted for the enumeration of the basic vowels. But only ह्रस्व-दीर्घ-प्लुत varieties are considered for the enumeratin of Paniniya Shiksha as clear in the quoted portion.



The Enumeration as given by Sitarama,



is like this:



For each of the following ; ह्रस्व-दीर्घ-प्लुत (३) उदात्तानुदात्त-स्वरित (३) + सानुनासिक+निरनुनासिक (२) =3 x 3 x 2 =18.

तदित्थम्

\- अ इ उ ऋ एषां वर्णानां प्रत्येकमष्टादशभेदाः। 18 x 4 = 32 +

लृवर्णस्य द्वादश, तस्य दीर्घाभावात्। 12 = 44+

एचामपि द्वादश, तेषां ह्रस्वाभावात्।। 12 = 66.



The above will be the total number according to Siddhanta Kaumudi. He has given the above line of Siddhanta kaumudi for the number of each of the letters and there too he mixed up, with ऋ and लृ wrongly. both having 12 varieties, where as it is 18 for ऋ and 12 only for लृ and एच् (ए-ऐ-ओ-औ). And it is not the total number of vowels as mentioned in पाणिनीयशिक्षा which probably he had not read, but only stated passively on his reading the above lines but wrongly presented.
