I have given the source which was asked for which is पाणिनीयशिक्षा ---



which you can see in printed recensions of the same in the link given by Mr. Sundara which gives a count of वर्ण-s according to the different recensions of Paniniya Shiksha and also according to the Pratishakhya-s. You can see the verse quoted in this link in PaniniyaShiksha itself, as the 2nd verse:



<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_unic/pANinIyashikShA_sa.html>



The first verses gives a variable count of वर्ण-s either 63 or 64 in the beginning and the same is the difference in counting the vowels. separately. in the previous verse:



*त्रिषष्टिश्चतुःषटिर्वा वर्णा शम्भुमते मताः \|  
*प्राकृते संस्कृते चापि स्वयं प्रोक्ताः स्वयम्भुवा \|\|३\|\|  

Considering whether लृ has प्लुत or not. Considering प्लुत variety, the total number will be 22, otherwise 21 only the total number of स्वर-s and it is not the number of varieties of each स्वर-s which will never make this number. This was the question asked for. You can go through the Book Paniyashiksha critically Edited available in the link given by Mr. Sundar.
