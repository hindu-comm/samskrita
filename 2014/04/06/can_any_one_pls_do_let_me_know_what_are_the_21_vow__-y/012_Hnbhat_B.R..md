There are 34 Shiksha-s other than Paniniya Shiksha, which are collected in a bundle, called शिक्षासंग्रह published by SampurNananda University. The collection oशिक्षासूत्राणि contains both आपिशलसूत्र-s and the लघु and वृद्धपाठ of पाणिनीयशिक्षासूत्र, edited and published by Dayananda Saraswathi, along with चान्द्रवर्ण-सूत्र-s. The question was raised on the versified form of पाणिनीयशिक्षा which I made it clear from the text of पाणिनीयशिक्षा available popularly with सिद्धान्तकौमुदी text as appendix and in the website. The Book edited by Manmohan Ghosh gives different versions of पाणिनीयशिक्षा available in Five Different recensions with Introduction and translation and doubts the originality of the वृद्ध and लघु पाठ version published by Dayananda Sarasvathi which was again countered by युधिष्ठिरमीमांसक the Editor of शिक्षासूत्राणि in a separate article मूलपाणिनीयशिक्षा published in a journal साहित्य, in 1956 from Patna and established the सूत्रपाठ is the original शिक्षा written by पाणिनि and not the popular versified form popularly known as Vedanga Shiksha.

  

This is the short and long of ShikSha-s and the question was raised from the popular versified form which clearly counts the vowels as 21 and it is explained by the commentaries on it.
