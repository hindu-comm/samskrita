There is another kind of division as in वृद्ध पाठ -  

सप्तधा स्वरा भवन्ति - as per वृद्ध पाठ

उदात्त

उदात्तर

अनुदात्त

अनुदात्तर

स्वरित

स्वरितेयोदात्त:

एकश्रुति  

  

Each of the above seven will have ह्रस्व, दीर्ध, प्लुत  

  

सानुनासिक, निरनुनासिक  

7x3x2 = 42 types

  

so अ इ उ ऋ will have ४२ types each. Same rules apply for लृ, ए ओ ऐ औ ।  

लृ does not have दीर्ध

  
ए ओ ऐ औ - Does not have ह्रस्व  

This division is based on शिक्षा वृद्ध पाठ - Earlier one I gave was from शिक्षा लघु पाठ by महर्षी दयानन्द । I attached screenshot from that book and it clearly states   
सानुनासिक, निरनुनासिक as two types.  

  

Please let me know if my understanding is correct or not
