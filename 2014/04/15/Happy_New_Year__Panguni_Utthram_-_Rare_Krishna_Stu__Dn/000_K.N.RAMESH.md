Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. For those you adhere to solar calendar, may I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year!. May The New Year bring eternal happiness, peace and fulfillment in all your endeavors with the grace of Lord.

  

Panguni Uthiram is a special occasion in the Hindu Calendar which is important to almost all deity forms - Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, Lord Subrahmanya, etc. though it is predominantly celebrated as the wedding day of Lord Vishnu and Lord Subrahmanya.

  

Do we need an occasion to pray Lord? No. So, I am happy to share a very rare hymn on Lord Krishna by Goddess Sarasvati taken from Sri Krishna Yamala Tantra, Chapter 11. Lord Krishna assures that He is responsible to bestow devotion to the Lord for those who chant this hymn.

  

Therefore, let us welcome the New Year with this prayer to Lord Krishna, and invoke Him to Be With Us Always and Lead Us in all our endeavors in this new year!
