Thank you so much, Sunder!

 This is a beautiful piece of work, even tho still in beta stage. I'll try to do some proofing when time permits.

 It's particularly interesting to me because of its coverage of the author, vAsiSTha gaNapati, esp. his surrender to ramaNa (then called "the little brAhmaNa", ever since he came to aruNAcala as a teenager). gaNapati was puzzled by the notion of \_tapas\_, which is commonly understood as ascetic practice, like standing on one foot at the edge of a cliff. ramaNa had a different view of tapas: 

  

"If one watches where his notion of "I" springs, the mind will be absorbed into that. That is tapas. If a mantra is repeated and attention is directed to the source where the mantra sound is produced, the mind will be absorbed in that. That is *tapas*.” The scholar-poet was filled with joy to have found his *guru*, and announced that the *upadeza* (teaching) was original, and that "Brahmana Swamy" was indeed a *maharSi* and should be called so thereafter. He gave the full name *baghavan zrI ramaNa maharSi* to Brahmana Swamy, whose original name was Venkataraman. Thus, the meeting was of profound significance not only for kAvyakaNTha but also for the world at large, which could learn from such a high authority about the real stature of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, the Silent Sage of Arunachala. Following this momentous meeting, Ganapati composed his great devotional poem, Umasahasram, a thousand verses in praise of Uma, the Divine Mother, as a part of his tapas in gratitude to the great Goddess for having given him the Maharshi as his Guru (Master). This work is the magnum opus of Sri vAsiSTa gaNapati muni. <http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/umasahasram/contents.html>

  

I wish someone would do a similar edition of zrI.ramaNa-gItA, which is a sort of psychic collaboration of ramaNa and gaNapati.
