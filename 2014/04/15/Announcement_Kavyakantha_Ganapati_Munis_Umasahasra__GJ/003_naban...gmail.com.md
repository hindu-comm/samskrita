Dear Sundarji,

Thanks for providing the pdf version of Umasahasranamastotram by Ganapati Muni. He was a versatile scholar and a proloific writer in Sanskrit. I hold a high esteem regarding his great contribution in the field of Sanskrit literature going through his works in stotra literature and varoius shastras including Vedic. It was a freshing to me to examine the dissertation on his Indrasahasranamastotram, prepared by Dr Savitri Panda of Utkal University. I would be glad to get more information about him and his works.

Regards,
