Pranams Prof. Bandyopadhyay,

  

 Thank you for your kind words which I shall convey to the project director Ms. Daksha Dalal and web-host at sanskrit at cheerful dot com.

  

 It would indeed be most fitting and honorific for your esteemed self to share your impressions of this doyen of Sanskrit and Scriptural literature. In fact the title of Kavyakantha was conferred on him at the Sanskrit Conference in Navadweep, Bengal, when he had barely crossed his teens! As far as I know, he was the ONLY person ever to address in Sanskrit the Indian National Congress annual convention in 1928. He had even drafted an outline of an ideal Constitution for independent India.

  

 We look forward eagerly to your articles.

  

  

Regards,

  

sunder
