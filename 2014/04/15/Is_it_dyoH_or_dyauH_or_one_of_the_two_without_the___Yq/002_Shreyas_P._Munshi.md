You have put only ???? after the first word. Neither dyoH or dyauH.Yes Sir, I placed ???? only because I was not sure what the correct word is and wanted to know what word it is..

  

  

Please give the text of the as you have downloaded. Is this the text:

  

ॐ*द्यौः शान्तिरन्तरिक्षं शान्तिः,*पृथिवी शान्तिरापः, शान्तिरोषधयः शान्तिः । वनस्पतयः शान्तिर्विश्वेदेवाः, शान्तिबर््रह्म शान्तिः, सर्वशान्तिः, शान्तिरेव शान्तिः, सा मा शान्तिरेधि॥ -३६.१७Yes Sir. That is *the* textdownloaded by me and I thought it was correct except for the doubts on *द्यौः and aन्तरिक्षं* which you have now nicely cleared.. One difference is in the compond शान्तिबर््रह्म where the first र् is printed before ब (between न्ति and ब which seems to be correct to me).

.  

  

is the correct sequence.

  

पृथिव्यन्तरिक्षं*द्यौर्दिशोऽवान्तरदिश:*अग्निर्वायुरादित्यश्चन्द्रमा नक्षत्राणि आप औषधयो वनस्पतय आकाश आत्मा-इत्यधिभूतम्-इत तैत्तिरीयनिषदुक्ते: (तै.उ.१। ७)।  

  

you are referring to Yes Sir or any other text as above where both occur without any specific context.

There are two words having similar form in the nominative singular both meaning "heaven" or "स्वर्ग" as per Amarakosha: first ending with vowel द्यो and the second ending in consonant दिव्.both used in feminine gender.

  

"*सुरलोको द्योदिवौ द्वे स्त्रियां*"  
  

for द्यो-शब्दः ओकारान्तः ---Thanks Sir. I had never came across an ओकारान्तः shabda. during my Sanskrit studies and so did not know thedeclension. Now I know that "There are two words having similar form in the nominative singular both meaning "heaven" or "स्वर्ग"".

  

     एकवचनम् द्विवचनम् बहुवचनम्

  

प्रथमा *द्यौः* द्यावौ द्यावः

द्वितीया द्याम् द्यावौ द्याः

तृतीया द्यवा द्योभ्याम् द्योभिः

चतुर्थी द्यवे द्योभ्याम् द्योभ्यः

पञ्चमी द्योः द्योभ्याम् द्योभ्यः

षष्ठी   द्योः द्यवोः द्यवाम्

सप्तमी द्यवि द्यवोः द्योषु

सं.प्र  द्यौः द्यावौ द्यावः

  

and दिव्-ending in व् consonant:

  

  

एकवचनम् द्विवचनम् बहुवचनम्

*प्रथमा द्यौः* दिवौ दिवः

द्वितीया दिवम् दिवौ दिवः

तृतीया दिवा द्युभ्याम् द्युभिः

चतुर्थी दिवे द्युभ्याम् द्युभ्यः

पञ्चमी दिवः द्युभ्याम् द्युभ्यः

षष्ठी दिवः दिवोः दिवाम्

सप्तमी दिवि दिवोः द्युषु

सं.प्र द्यौः दिवौ दिवः

  

But both differ in other case endings. Both are again used to denote sky or atmosphere, where the Gods are said to be dwelling and moving. See the last both one:You have cleared my doubt completely, Sir.

%atha vyomavargaH  

Sky or atmosphere (26)

( १. २. १६७) द्योदिवौ द्वे स्त्रियामभ्रं व्योम पुष्करमम्बरम् \|

( १. २. १६८) नभोऽन्तरिक्षं *गगनमनन्तं सुरवर्त्म* खम् ।।१-२-१।।

  

It is used in neuter gender generally.Noted. But could be used in masculine also if the reading is from authentic publication. I have given another instance of its use in neuter gender.

  

Hope this makes clarity.Yes, very much Sir. Thank you once again.
