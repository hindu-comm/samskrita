Respected scholars in the group,

Kindly enlighten me.

In the shAnti pATh:

"om ???? shAntiH antarikshaH shAnti pruthivi shAnti etc", which is the word after the first om (shown by me as four question mark symbols)?

Is it 'dyoH' or 'dyauH' or one of the two without the visarga? Theversions downloaded from the internet give the two different spellings as above plus one without the visarga.(My Devasthali dictionary gives the word as 'dyo' f. Heaven or sky).  
What is the correct pratipAdik? And what would be its declensions in nominative and accusative singular, dual and plural.

  

Also, is 'antariksha' masculine or neuter because in one version it is printed as .'antarikshaH' and 'antariksham' in the other.

Submitted in all humility...Shreyas
