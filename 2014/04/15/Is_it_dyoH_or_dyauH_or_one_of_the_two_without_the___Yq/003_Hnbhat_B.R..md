No. You should have heard very common word गो - which is declined similarly in both masculine and feminine gender, referring ox and cow respectively.

  

( २. ९. १२९३) अनड्वान् सौरभेयो गौः उक्ष्णां संहतिरौक्षकम्  

(।।२-९-६०।।)

( २. ९. १३०६) माहेयी सौरभेयी गौरुस्रा माता च शृङ्गिणी ।।२-९-६६।।

  

The same word used for ox and cow.

  

  

  

But there is no difference in declension in any case. Only by the usage of the word one can decide the gender from the context, as गो is having several meaning and according to meaning the gender may vary between masculine and feminine.

  

( ३. ३. ३७३) स्वर्गेषुपशुवाग्वज्रदिङ्नेत्रधृणिभूजले

*( ३. ३. ३७४) लक्ष्यदृष्ट्या स्त्रियां पुंसि गौः.*

  

The second I have translated in the last line. All the quotations are from Amarakosha.
