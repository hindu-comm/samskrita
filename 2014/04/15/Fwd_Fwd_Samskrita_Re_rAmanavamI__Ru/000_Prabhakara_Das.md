Dear Vijaya Kumar ji,  
// As per the TIFR study  
available here <http://web.tifr.res.in/~vahia/tithi-calculations.pdf>  
our calculations hold  
good till about 500 AD . As we go backwards , the actual  
tithi and the calculated tithi may be different by almost a  
week !//  
This is ignorance! It depends on which algorithm do we use. Software  
like JHora gives planetary positions of BC 5000 or more also with  
accuracy. And as we know the only date for which the horoscope of Rama  
as told in Ramayana is true at least to an extent is - 10th January  
BC 5114 12 Noon (Gregorian). But for that day even though all the  
other factors match, the Nakshatra is Pushyami (and not Punarvasu).  
The planetary position is attached.

Dear Friends ,  
  
Navami Tithi , Nakshatra Punravasu , and Sun in Aries cannot  
happen simultaneously .  
  
  
Navami means moon /  
sun angle is between 96 to 108 degrees . In that case with  
Sun in Aries , the moon will be in Pushya nakshatra . Pushya  
nakshatra starts at 93.20 degrees . So for it to be navami  
the sun will have to be in Pisces , or the Nakshatra will  
have to be Pushya . So all these three things together are  
not possible .  
  
  
  
BUT  
  
This is when we are  
only taking our today's space time backwards with the  
assumption that everything else remained same or changed as  
per the constants that we are holding in the equations at  
present . That may not be the case .  
  
  
  
This does not  
consider the precession of the earth - or rather it  
considers it to be at constant speed .  
  
  
  
As per the TIFR study  
available here <http://web.tifr.res.in/~vahia/tithi-calculations.pdf>  
  
  
  
our calculations hold  
good till about 500 AD . As we go backwards , the actual  
tithi and the calculated tithi may be different by almost a  
week !  
  
  
  
So may be the  
panchang used then was different . That has some pauranik  
reference too . In nakshatra calculations earlier on  
Krittika used to be the first nakshatra and Bharani used to  
be the last and Abhijit was included . Now Abhijit is  
excluded , Ashvini is first and Revati is last . Earlier  
system makes sense as the devata for Krittika is Agni (the  
beginning shlokas of Ved also refer to Agni ) and the devata  
of Bharani is Yama . So we can safely say that we cannot  
reach the time line of Ramayana by the simple exercise of  
moving backwards in time .  
  
  
  
Now coming to Rashis  
not being mentioned in the literature . May be they were not  
in vogue . As of even today , most people remember Shivaji  
Maharaj Jayanti as March 1 or February 19 . Not many  
remember the Indian Tithi . Same may have been the case then  
. ( We are just 300 years down the line and so much of  
written literature exists , still this is the case . ) ( I  
am just theorising. ) As far as Dr. Dixit's work is  
concerned , I fully agree that it is extensive ; but need  
not be taken as the last word . The research tools at his  
disposal were limited and a lot more information has become  
available since then and tools have advanced so we need not  
consider what he said as to be the last word . I believe  
if he were present he also would be busy adding to what he  
has already done. Please note that I am not making this  
statement flippantly . I am full of gratitude for the people  
like Dr. Dixit , and many others who spent their entire  
lives for this single purp0se .  
  
  
  
Think it like this .  
Lokmanya Tilak was a great mathematician . He wrote Orion  
and explained many of the Vedic phenomenon with celestial  
happenings . But he was doing all this in the shadow of  
Pandit Max Muller . So he had to fit everything in those  
3000 years . In later dates when the Max Muller limitation  
was removed , a number of new theories came out .  
  
  
  
  
  
  
So yes , I agree with you when you say that the data does  
not fit , albeit for a different reason .  
  
Regards ,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Regards ,

Dear  
Group,  
  
  
  
  
Today Ramanavami is  
being observed all over India, in celebration of the belief  
that Rama was born  
on the 9th tithi of the Shukla PakSha of Chaitra. I was  
wondering as to what would be the  
source of this belief and to satisfy my curiosity did some  
digging of relevant texts available on the  
Internet. The following is the summary  
of what I found.  
  
  
  
The texts available  
on the internet appear to fall in two classes on this  
subject. In one class are those texts which, in  
Balakanda Sarga 18, give the following arrangement of  
heavenly bodies at the  
time of Rama's birth. This extract is  
taken from 'Ramayana of Valmiki' by Shastri  
Shrinivasa Katti Mudholkara and  
Satkari Mukhopadhyaya, 1983, Delhi available here.

ततः च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ \|\| १-१८-८  
  
  
  
  
नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु \|  
  
  
  
  
ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह \|\| १-१८-९  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The website  
<http://www.valmikiramayan.net>  
also has the same text.  
  
  
  
  
  
'Translation  
of Ramayana' by Manmatha Nath Dutt, Calcutta, 1894  
translates this passage at p.49  
is as under:  
  
  
  
  
"And then when  
the six seasons had rolled away after the completion of the  
sacrifice, in the  
twelfth month, on the ninth lunar day, under the Punarvasu  
asterism, when the  
Sun, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Venus were at Arius,  
Capricorn, Libra,  
Cancer and Pisces, and when Jupiter had arisen with the Moon  
at Cancer,  
Kausalya gave birth to the lord of the  
universe..."  
  
  
  
A text called  
'Adhyatmaramayana' and its translation by Munilal,  
which appears to be an abridgement  
of the original Ramayana and which is printed by the Geeta  
Press, Gorakhpur, is  
available here  
and says the following  
  
  
  
  
मधुमासे सिते पक्षे नवम्यां कर्कटे शुभे।  
  
  
  
  
पुनर्वस्वृक्षसहिते उच्चस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके॥  
  
  
  
  
मेषं पूषणि संप्राप्ते... सर्ग ३, श्लोक १४,१५.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The English  
translation of Ramayana, by Ralph T.H.Griffith in [sacred-texts.com](http://sacred-texts.com)  
available  
here  
  
also echoes the  
above.  
  
  
  
  
  
Tulasidasa's  
Ramacharitamanasa (source: Wikisource) gives similar  
details:  
  
  
  
तबहिं रायँ प्रिय नारि बोलाईं। कौसल्यादि तहाँ चलि आई॥  
  
  
  
  
अर्ध भाग कौसल्याहि दीन्हा। उभय भाग आधे कर कीन्हा॥  
  
  
  
  
कैकेई कहँ नृप सो दयऊ। रह्यो सो उभय भाग पुनि भयऊ॥  
  
  
  
  
कौसल्या कैकेई हाथ धरि। दीन्ह सुमित्रहि मन प्रसन्न करि॥  
  
  
  
  
एहि बिधि गर्भसहित सब नारी। भईं हृदयँ हरषित सुख भारी॥  
  
  
  
  
जा दिन तें हरि गर्भहिं आए। सकल लोक सुख संपति छाए॥  
  
  
  
  
मंदिर महँ सब राजहिं रानी। सोभा सील तेज की खानीं॥  
  
  
  
  
सुख जुत कछुक काल चलि गयऊ। जेहिं प्रभु प्रगट सो अवसर भयऊ॥
