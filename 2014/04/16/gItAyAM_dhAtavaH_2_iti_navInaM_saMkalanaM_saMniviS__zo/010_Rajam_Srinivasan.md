When I learnt the varNamaala I understood thus:-- dra = as you put in vrat with an "a" sound; dri = as r + i sound; dru = as r + u; none of them = to R sound as in rshi. Here R sound is "purring" sound without any vowel used as a "closure" sound which is the case in all consonants.
Sound of R in Rshi itself is considered as a unique "vowel"-like in our varNamaala, that is why it is a part of the "swaras" not of "vyanjanaas". The vowel u as in Uma is NOT the closure or end-sound of R and nor is the vowel i as in ishTa. R in Rshi is not r in ranga nor is it the r as in rudra, it is as in Rtu or Rshabha.  The problem arises due to the need for "transcription" -- transformation of symbols of one language representing the sounds of that languages to the symbols representing another language -- more specifically another script. One has to be satisfied only with close approximation and not expect a complete equivalence.

  

Perhaps my understanding is wrong? Hope to be corrected. Thanks and regards
