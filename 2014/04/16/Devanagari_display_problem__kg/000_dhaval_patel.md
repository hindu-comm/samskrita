Dear all,

the following website has some catalogue of sanskrit manuscripts.

<http://cloud.ap.nic.in/disha/s1/s1subbooks.jsp?S=GR>.  

  

For some reasons, I have not been able to see them in proper devanagari.

I am attaching a snapshot.

I tried firefox, chrome, internet explorer but without any avail.

  

Please help in this regard. There is no contact detail on the web page.
