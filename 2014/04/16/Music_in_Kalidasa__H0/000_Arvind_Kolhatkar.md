Dear Group,

  

The website of the ITC Sangeet Research Academy has the following in describing music in India in the time of the Guptas:

  

\<Kalidasa's works mention musical instruments like the Parivadini vina, Vipanchi vina, Pushkar, Mridang, Vamshi and Shankha, different types of songs like the Kakaligeet, Streegeet and Apsarogeeti, technical terms like Murchana, Swarasaptaka and Tana and qualities of voice like Kinnarkanthi and Valguvagam.\>

  

I know that out of these, the terms पुष्कर and मूर्च्छना appear respectively in मालविकाग्निमित्रम् and मेघदूत. The latter also has तन्त्री in it. I would like to know, with reference, in which works of Kalidasa do the remaining terms appear. Are there any other references in Kalidasa that display his knowledge of music?
