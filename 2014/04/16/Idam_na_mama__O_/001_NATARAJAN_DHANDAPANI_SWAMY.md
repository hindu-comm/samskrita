cha me - means grant

idam namama - this is not mine.

  

If one person wants to do rudra chamaga homam to grant many things from Almighty then he should use Idam namama also.

In agni karya - the process of doing Holy Fire, Idam namama is must.

Important to note that - the ahuthi or offering to agni i.e. the ghee - that thing only applicable for idam namama NOT for granting from God.
