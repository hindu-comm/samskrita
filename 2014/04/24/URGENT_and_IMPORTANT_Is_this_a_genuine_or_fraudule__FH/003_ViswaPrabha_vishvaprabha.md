Please DO NOT EVEN RESPOND TO OR BOTHER about such mails!  
  

These are the handiworks of notorius crooks. They somehow get hold the user ID and password of a poor internet user and then send such mails to all the people in his contact list.  
  
  

The real user may not have even dreamt of Ukraine in his whole life. He would be happily resting at his home or working in his office.  
  

These people will prepare such messages with such impersonating and real-looking facts that anyone will believe it is a genuine call for help.
