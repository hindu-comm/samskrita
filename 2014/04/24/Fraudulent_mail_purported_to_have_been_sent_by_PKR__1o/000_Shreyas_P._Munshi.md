Members of the Group

"Thank you" to each member who promptly declared it isa fraudulent mail.

Even I suspected it to be so and that is why instead of forwarding the mail, I copy-pasted and sent as a separate email.

Yes, we need to be careful, I agree; but I now suspectthat the sender of the mischief mail is in somehow or the other connected with the Group or witha member of the Group. And this calls for extra caution.

Regards...Shreyas
