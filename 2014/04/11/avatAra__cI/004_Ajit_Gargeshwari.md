The 12 avatars are mentioned in the Matsya Purana as being incarnations of Vishnu during the 12 battles between Devas and Asuras to aid the Devas. Please see chapter 47 Verses 41 to 45  

I have attached the page for reference

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
