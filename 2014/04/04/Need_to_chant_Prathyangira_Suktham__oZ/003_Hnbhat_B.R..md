If you are particular about Pratyangira Sukta of Rigveda, I may help. But I could not find it in Rigveda Khila portion by name. If you are sure of it, you can get reference to the beginning of the Sukta and I can help to find the mantra-s.

  

  

If you are not particular of the Vedic Sukta of Pratyangira, and instead if you want Pratyangira Sahasranama or any other Stotra-s of Pratyangira, you can have them online.



The Sahasranama Stotra text is available here for download:

Here is a site with Srividya stotra-s in general:

And Pratyangira-kavaca, Pratyangira-samputIkarana and others are available in audio format online. And if you want some in mp3 format, I may share it privately.

  

Here is the link for Video and audio of Pratyangira kavaca.

You can get more audio formats if you also make search on Google. for the Stotra-s. I have not heard of Pratyangira Sukta as you have requested.
