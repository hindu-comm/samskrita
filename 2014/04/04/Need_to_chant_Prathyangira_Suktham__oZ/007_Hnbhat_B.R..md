You can ask the owner of the scribd for allowing you to download it. But unfortunately I too saw that site, but no way of approaching him. But no details of the Sookta is found anywhere on the web. So I thought the result page might have been produced by robo-s during the search. Many such results we can find on Google Search.

  

If you really want protection you can recite Pratyangira Kavaca which is specially meant for protection. That is why I posted the video links.

  

Anyhow God bless you and protect you.
