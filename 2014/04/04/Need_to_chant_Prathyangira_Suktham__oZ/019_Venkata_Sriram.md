Namaste,



There is nothing like pratyangira suktam. Infact, it is the "bhadrakali sukta" from Atharva Veda which is commonly known as pratyangira sukta.
For that, take the help of vedic scholar who is well-versed in Atharva Veda.



BTW, i see that there is a craze among people for this typical deity called "pratyangira" which is not advisable for upAsana.These so-calledpratyangira upasana is a big madness.For these sort of tantrika prayogas, oneshould needguidance of good guru.



Start the pArAyaNa ofsundarakANDa and invoke the blessings of shri hanumanji. Everything would be OK.



regs,

sriram
