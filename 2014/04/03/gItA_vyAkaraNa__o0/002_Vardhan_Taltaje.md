Answers to 1 & 2 are given in गीताधातुरुपावली by Dr. Vishwasa, published by Samskrita Bharati. Priced at Rs 40 only, every Samskrit + Gita student should possess it.  
  
As far as Question# 3, सन्त: is plural of सत् . This as per the book 'Critical Word Index to Bhagavad Gita' by P.C.Divanji & Foreword by Khatre. This too is an invaluable book for Samskrit + Gita students. It is available in [archive.org](http://archive.org) for downloading.
