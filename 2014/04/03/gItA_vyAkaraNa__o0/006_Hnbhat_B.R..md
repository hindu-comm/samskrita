Please read the messages completely and not here and there. Read carefully Ambarisha's reply:

If you are particular about the rule, "माङि लुङ् ३।३।१७५" the लुङ् लकार, in all the tenses, with मा अव्यय associated with any verb. So it is here गम् and the लुङ् form is used in prohibition of गम्. ""मा स्म मालं च वारणे ।। ३.५.९१३" makes the use of this phrase in preventing or prohibiting any action and the act associated with the verb used in the लुङ् in the case of "मा स्म" + गम् in लुङ्. Ambarish has already explained. The rule for this is the application of ३. ३. १७५ माङि लुङ् । and

३. ३. १७६ स्म उत्तरे लङ् च । in the case of the माङ् associated with स्म, it can take लुङ् or लङ्.

  

The same question has been discussed in detail in this thread earlier:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/APNjmR0QIw4/NyBEdBQ1vu0J>  

  

Please read in detail the above discussion. So no other लकार-s are allowed. And for your information, there is another मा which is not माङ्, required by the rule. In such cases, rarely लोट् can be used. like मा गच्छ etc. But with माङ् with or without स्म, it should take लुङ् लकार.
