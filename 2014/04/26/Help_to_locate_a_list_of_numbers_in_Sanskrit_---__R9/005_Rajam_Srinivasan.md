Thank you, much obliged!

  

I am not a mathematician (unfortunately); but somehow the "numbers" and everything to do with them fascinates me to no end. They are so magical and mystical. This penchant for numbers runs in my family although none has become a mathematician.



I wonder if some peculiar inclinations are special "legacies" from our ancestors!!  One of our ancestor -- a MaTHaadHipatHi of Parakaala MaTHam is reputed to be the author of four volumes on alankaara shaastra and another one from our Gotram, -- Vaduula is supposed to be one of the composers of several Sulbha suutras! I wonder if there is some kind of "spiritual DNA" passed on to one's progeny! When we say "it is in the genes" do we mean this kind of DNA? But, then we have this adage for dull students "Pandita putra."

  

Anyway thanks again and again.
