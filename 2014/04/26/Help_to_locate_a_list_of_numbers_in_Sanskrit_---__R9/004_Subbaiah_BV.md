Best regards,  
Venkata Subbaiah Bathula.  
  
नास्ति विद्यासमं चक्षुः, नास्ति सत्यसमं तपः ।  
नास्ति रागसमं दुःखं, नास्ति त्यागसमं सुखम् ॥  
There is no eye equal to knowledge; there is no penance parallel to truth;  
There is no pain akin to desire; there is no happiness synonymous to renunciation/sacrifice.
