I came across a list of numbers denoted by Sanskrit names in Sanskrit documents list. I don't remember the name of the file. But the content goes with the names:

  

इन्दुः, = १

खम् = १

अक्षि = २

वसवः अष्टौ

ग्रहाः - नव

आदित्याः - द्वादश

and the like. I can't remember exactly the form of the list, but the content is like above.

  

I shall be obliged if any had seen that list in the Sanskrit documents list (which I could not locate now) or any other site and give me the link.

  

With regards
