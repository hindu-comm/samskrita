Prasad,

Some interesting additional work for you!

  
Sholars have felt thatthe Bangaluru based Samskrita Bharati publications (monthly sambhashana sandesha magazine as well as recent translations of many short-stories and novels) have contributed significantly to the creation of a very large Sanskrit lexicon of modern words and phrases suitable for modern life

AND THAT:

A dictionary created out of the modern words found in these publications would certainly be a wonderful pursuit.

  

Since you are involved in the 'Dictionary Project' at IIT Powai as a part of your PhD programme (I dont know if you have already finished it!), I thought you could contribute if time permits. Please read the emails given below and you will have clearer idea of what the scholars have in mind. If you think you are willing to contribute, and have time for it,kindly respond initially to me with CC to Prof Bhat at [hnbh...@gmail.com]() and the group at "[sams...@googlegroups.com]()" [sams...@googlegroups.com](). Then take over directly...Shreyas

  

CC Group; For your information, Mr (or Dr) Prasad Bhide is MA in Sanskrit, MA in Linguistics, teaches Sanskrit at the Ruia College in Mumbai and (if he has not already finished) is currently doing his PhD at the IIT Powai, Mumbai.  

Regards to all,
