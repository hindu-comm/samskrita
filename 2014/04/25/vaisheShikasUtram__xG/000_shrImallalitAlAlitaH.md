I heard that there is a vR^itti on vaisheShika-sUtra by bhAradvAja and another commentary by bhikshu(viGYAnabhikshu ??).  
  

While I could not find any details about the vR^itti of bhAradvAja, wiki-page on viGYAnabhikshu did't list any work on vaisheShika-sUtra-s by him.  
  

I'm sure that bhAradvAja-vR^itti was printed. I've know clue about that of bhikshu. I heard that it was listed as reference books in some edition.  
  

Those who have more knowledge about these, please share.
