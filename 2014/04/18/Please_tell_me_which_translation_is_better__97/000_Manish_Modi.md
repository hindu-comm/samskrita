\|\| ॐ ह्रीं श्री मुनिसुव्रताय नमः \|\|  

\|\| Auṃ Hrīṃ Śrī Munisuvratāya Namaḥ \|\|  

Jay Jinendra

  

Dear friends,

  

Please tell me which translation of the following verse is better:

  

muktvā paratra parabuddhim ahaṃdhiyaṃ ca saṃsāraduḥkhajananīṃ jananād vimuktaḥ

jyotirmayaṃ sukham upaiti parātmaniṣṭhastanmārgam etad adhigamya samādhitantram

**  
**

**Translation 1**

Having abandoned hereafter the conception of “this is me, this is my” and “this are you, this is yours” (and the illusion that the self is identical with the body), (the practitioner of yoga) is released from the cycle of rebirth, which is the mother of suffering. After he studied this manual on contemplation (Samādhitantra), the path to the summit of the perfect goal (of liberation), he enjoys the bliss made of supreme illumination. 

  

**Translation 2**

He who rids himself of the tendency of considering external substances to be his own

Becomes free from transmigration, which is the cause of all sorrow.

Having mastered the path explained in the samādhitantra,

He shall engross himself in the transcendental self

And gain the effulgent bliss of liberation.

**  
**

**Translation 3**

This samādhitantra {technique of auto-immersion} shows a path of happiness beyond the senses.

One who masters this scripture gives up all external objects,

Gives up identification with and desire for external substances

And immerses himself in the supreme transcendental self.

He escapes the bonds of transmigration, which causes all suffering

And attains the effulgent bliss of liberation.  

  

****

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
