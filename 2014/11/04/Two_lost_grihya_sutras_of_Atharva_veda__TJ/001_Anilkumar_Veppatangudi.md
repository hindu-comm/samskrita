**Dear Shri Animesh,**

**Very interesting to know that you have discovered two more Grihya Sutras belonging to Atharva Veda, What are the names? I have collected 18 Grihya Sutras of diffent Vedas but could not get Paingiya and Parashara Grihya Sutras of Rig Veda and Baijavapa Grihya Sutra of Shukla Yajur Veda though I had come across references to them. Under Atharva Veda I have Kaushika Grihya Sutra.**

**Regards,  
Anil Kumar.**
