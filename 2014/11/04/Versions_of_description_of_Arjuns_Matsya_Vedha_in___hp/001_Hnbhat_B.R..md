The answer for the last question is that it may be as many as the versions of Mahabharata itself as recorded in the Critical Apparatus.

  

For being authentic, you have to do some research. Critical Edition accepts the least common verses in all the versions.

  

I have heard only the the shooting of moving object (matsya) by seeing its reflection is described in Mahabharata. I have not seen other versions as I have read the abridged version of Mahabharata in my childhoold and I never bothered about the technical details of Matsyavedhayanta or its construction.
