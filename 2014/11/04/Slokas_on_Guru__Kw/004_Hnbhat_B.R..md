If the non-compound परं does not give the meaning Supreme, Absolute, the compound also could not give the meaning. That is the rule for compound formation.

  

Please refer to the word पर in any standard dictionary.

(H1B) para 1 \[p= 586,2\] \[L=116024\] m. or n. the Supreme or Absolute Being, the Universal Soul Up. R. Pur.  

  

The above is from the Monier Williams dictionary. You can find many other meanings for any word.
