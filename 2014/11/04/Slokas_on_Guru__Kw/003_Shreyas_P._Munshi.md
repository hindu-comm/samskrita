Both are metrically correct. Only one is non-compound and the other compound.



Thank you Bhat Sir for the above clarification. The doubt arose in my mind only because in the group with which I was associated some years ago, the chanting was 'gurureva parabrahma' and nowthe online spoken Sanskrit dictionary gives meaning of 'param' as 'but', 'after' etc. For 'The Absolute', 'The Supreme' it gives the Sanskrit word as 'parama'. It does give 'para' as an adjective but the meaning given is not 'Supreme' or 'Absolute'.
