Murthy Sir, this is a very well done work.



Highly useful. All dhAtus arranged according to upasargas.

I just wanted to know from group members, if this work has been digitized. (editable, typed text- not just scanning of printed book). Or any work has been done in the direction of this book, or based on this book. And if someone wanted to do digitization (just preparing a editable computer copy for the use of scholars, like a digital dictionary), will they need permission from author/publishers?
