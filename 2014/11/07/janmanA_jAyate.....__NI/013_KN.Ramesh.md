Respected Dr.Bhat Mahoday!

  

Excellent explanations!

  

I shall go with apasthamba rather than the verse.  

  

But the objections raised by naastikas are the following:

1\) Veda vyasa - who gave us the 4 vedas, his birth is questionable? Not only that his son Vidura's birth too [w.r.to](http://w.r.to) caste is being questioned. Then it is here in these type of situations, that they take shelter with the verse.

  

2\) Coming to upanayana, since the word has several meanings, the naastikas take it as "leading near to" and not investiture of sacred thread ceremony.

  

3\) Then are shudras not at all eligible for becoming a brahmana, leave aside attaining moksha?

  

Coming to the blog reference, it was the mail from Sri.Bryan Hill which I have posted and I really do not own them. Strictly speaking, I do not even know whether the verses quoted along with the sources are real. My intention was to just share the verse is from Manusamhita & not otherwise. Now that it is proved wrong along with the sloka from Yaksa nirukta, I would like to know whether the verses quoted from Mahabharata, real?

 यस्तु शूद्रो दमे सत्ये धर्मे च सततोत्थितः ।

 तं ब्राह्मणम् अहम् मअन्ये वृत्तेन हि भवेद्द्विजः ॥

 " I consider to be a brAhmaNa that shUdra who is ever endowed with self - restraint, truthfulness anddharma. A man becomes a brAhmaNaby his conduct. "

 (mahAbhArata, vanaparva 206.12)

 शूद्रे चैतद् भवेल्लक्ष्यं द्विजे चैतन्न विद्यते ।

 न वै शूद्रो भवेच्छूद्रो ब्राह्मणो न च ब्राह्मणः ॥

 " If these characteristics be found in a shUdra and if they be not found in a brAhmaNa, then such a shUdra is not a shUdra and such a brAhmaNa is not a brAhmaNa."

(mahAbhArata, shAntiparva 182.8)

  

I dont know.

  

I dont know the answer to the first question,since by now the source of the verse is not from Manusamhita is made clear by you.

  

however I reiterate to be with अतो मीमांसका कृपया विशदीकुर्वन्त्वित्यभ्यर्थये! विषयोऽयं केवलं विवेचनार्थमेवोपस्थापित इति विनिवेद्यते।
