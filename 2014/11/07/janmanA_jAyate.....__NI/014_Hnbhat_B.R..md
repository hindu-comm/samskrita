According to Nastka-s, the birth of Vedavyasa itself is enough. He was born in Matsyagandhya who is a Shudra, and not necessarily be called a Brahmin. So they naturally follow his words and not Manu or other Dharmashastra as evidence.

This was answered. They do not believe in divine birth or divinity of the Sages. So they are quoting the verses out of context.

  

I have not been able to locate the verse in their context.

The verse before this makes the context clear:

  

03,206.011a brāhmaṇaḥ patanīyeṣu vartamāno vikarmasu

03,206.011c dāmbhiko duṣkṛtaprāyaḥ ***śūdreṇa sadṛśo bhavet**\|*

  

The same meaning in the next verses. That does not make a**śūdrea**a brahmana, but such a sincere

one in his manners, could be considered as Brahmana.

  

In other words, the whole context, expect one to be in consonance with सामान्यधर्म, in addition with the वर्णाश्रमधर्म, which are prescribed in धर्मशास्त्र-s and out of context, these verses mislead people who believe in धर्मशास्त्र with the misquoted translations.

  

This is the fact about the quotations from महाभारत. These people fail to grasp the real intention of the context, but cling to the literal meaning through translations.

  

The only reply to those people these had been given by भर्तृहरि ---

  

अज्ञः सुखमाराध्यः सुखतरमाराध्यते विशेषज्ञः ।

ज्ञानलवदुर्विदग्धं ब्रह्मापि तं नरं न रञ्जयति ॥

  

So how can we human beings can satisfactorily reply their questions?

  

I have given the source अत्रिस्मृति as the original of the quotation, then twisted into जन्मना जायते शूद्रः with the above anonymously authored verse in the first post.
