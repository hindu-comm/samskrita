I had encoded about 6 prpathaka in Itrans with sanskrit98 fonts (Which  
was not Unicode) way back in Feb 2002 when unicode was not available  
- to me at least.  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/taitsamhita1.txt_sans98>  
  
TS 1.1 is only one which has been proof read and  
I am attaching the associated PDF.  
  
There are audio files of entire TS available which can be used in  
encoding diirgha svarita.  
  
I am willing to participate and contribute to the best of my  
ability/capacity (none is much though) in this regards..  
  
With warm regards and thanks to the great effort,
