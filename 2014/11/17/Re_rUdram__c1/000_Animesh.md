Srī mātre namah

  
Thank you every one for his valuable comments .  
I will shortly update the post .  
One thing I want to share is I have encoded version of taittriya samhitA used in Maharashtra and Varanasi .  
In this version long ( dirgh svarita ) svarita is not marked .Only it is recited orally.  
I have used printed version of taittriya samhita by Chowkhamba publication Varanasi.
