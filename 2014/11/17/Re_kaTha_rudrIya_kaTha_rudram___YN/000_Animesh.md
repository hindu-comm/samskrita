Srī mātre namah

Namaste ,

Shata rudrIya is one of the most popular hymns of Vedas. Commonly recited versions are taittarIya in south India ( famously known as SrI rUdraM / श्री रुद्रम् ) and vAjasaneya in north India ( famously known as rUdrAshtadhyAyI ).  
The "kaTha rudrIya" is kAthaka ( charaka ) version of SrI rUdraM . (also known as कठ रुद्रम् )  
I have posted the complete kaTha rudra with svara, vinIyoga , dhyAna and possible information which I was able to gather about it.  
I request all group members to visit it .
