Modern Hinduism as practised in India, owes much to the Puranas. The Puranas are an important genre of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist religious texts, notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of cosmology, philosophy, and rituals.

  

Puranas usually give prominence to a particular deity, employing an abundance of religious and philosophical concepts. They are usually written in the form of stories related by one person to another. The Puranas were composed in Sanskrit and most have been excellently translated into modern Indian languages.

  

The Puranas may be seen as a reflection of the aims and aspirations, views and ideologies, rights and rituals, religious and secular perspectives of ancient Indians. At once, they teach, educate and entertain.

  

We are proud to present before you, this beautiful series of Hindu Puranas, translated extremely skilfully into modern Hindi. We regret that only 8 Puranas have been published in this series so far. This set of 8 books is exceedingly low priced to allow everyone to buy this series and keep it in their homes.
