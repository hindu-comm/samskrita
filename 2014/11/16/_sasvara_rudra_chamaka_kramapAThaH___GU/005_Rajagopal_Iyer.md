namo namaH,  
  
मा॒तरं॑ प्रि॒याः । प्रि॒या मा ।  
  
imho, technically, There should be no ":" (visarga) after priyaa.  
  
AFAIK, visrga gets dropped hen followed by vowel

As always, I am humbly learn and willing to stand corrected.  
  
Another minor point regarding display is that letters such as ksha,  
the vedic anusvaara, diirgha svarita are somehow not displayed  
correctly. Any idea what has to be done for that?  
  
With respectful regards,
