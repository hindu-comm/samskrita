If this is in reply to my earlier posting about the presence of "dirgha-"-svarita in KYV , or more specifically TS , you are mistaken. To the best of my knowledge there is no 'definition' of 'Dirgha-svarita" in the Pratishakhyam.  
  
Further, the document also transcribes the TS Anusvara wrongly. There is no 'ukara' in the Agama-Anusvara that is unique to TS. Even more, the document does not mark 'vakyantas' in Yajyanuvakas (although it is quite uncommon even in traditional pada-patha pothis).
