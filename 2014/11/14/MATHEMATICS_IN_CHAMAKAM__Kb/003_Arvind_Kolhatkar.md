There is no mystery here and this 'trick' does not stop at 17 or any other odd number. It is an inherent property that can be explained by school-level algebra. I shall attempt to explain this in simple terms.

  

Set down all odd numbers in sequence, one below another, in a vertical column. For any odd number in this column, write against it the total of all its previous odd numbers + that number itself. You will see that the resulting sum is the square of (that odd number minus 1) / 2 + 1.

  

Thus, write the vertical column and the further algorithm:

  

1  1 + 0   = 1 = {(1 -1) / 2 + 1}^2

3  1 + 3   = 4 ={(3 - 1) / 2 + 1}^2

5  4 + 5   = 9 = {(5 - 1) / 2 + 1}^2

7  9 + 7   = 16 = {(7 - 1) / 2 + 1}^2

9  16 + 9  =25 = {(9 - 1) / 2 + 1}^2

11 25 + 11 = 36 = {(11 - 1) / 2 + 1}^2

17  64 + 17 = 81 = {(17 - 1) / 2 + 1)^2

19  81 + 19 = 100 = {(19 - 1) / 2 + 1)^2  

  

You can go on like this *ad infinitum* and the rule will always hold.

  

This happens because every odd number is expressible as (2n +1), 'n' taking values as 1,2,3 etc. In the above algorithm, if you set down(2n +1) in its proper place, you shall have to write against it n^2 (being the total of all its odd predecessors) *plus*that number itself i.e. (2n + 1). The result is n^2 +2n + 1, which is thesquareof (n + 1).

  

This is an inherent rule built into the number system. I do not know why it has been shown above as something unique to RudrasUkta. It could be an attempt of retrofitting and reading into ancient scriptures things that were not intended by the original composers.
