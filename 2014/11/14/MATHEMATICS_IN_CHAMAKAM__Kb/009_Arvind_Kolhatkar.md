I was not trying to explain any math at the bottom of the enumeration in Anuvaaka 11 of Chamaka but only answering to Rajagopal Ayer's (possible) suggestion that there was a mathematical mystery involved there.

  

As to what the sequence of odd numbers 1 to 33 and another sequence even numbers 4 to 48 mean in that Anuvaaka, I am too modest to hazard a guess. It is a mystery to me, not resolved even by reading traditional commentators like SayaNa and Bhattabhaaskara. SayaNa actually does not say anything about it beyond mentioning 'एकादिशब्दा: संख्यापरा:'.
(please see attachment below.) The Anandashrama text that I have does not contain anything from Bhattabhaaskara.

  

I have a Marathi commentary called 'रुद्रार्थदीपिका' by श्रीपादशास्त्री किंजवडेकर, a well-known Maharashtrian scholar of the mid-20th century.
He explains these numbers in terms of traditional philosophy as

  

एक - अविकृत, निर्गुण, निराकार ब्रह्म

तिस्र: - Three guNas as सत्त्व, रज, तम

पञ्च - पञ्चमहाभूतानि

सप्त - ५ ज्ञानेन्द्रियs + मनस् + बुद्धि

नव - नवद्वारयुक्त मनुष्यदेह

एकादश - ५ प्रमुख प्राण (प्राण, अपान, समान, व्यान, उदान) + ५ subsidiaries as देवदत्त, धनंजय, नाग, कूर्म, कृकल + सुषुम्ना नाडी.

  

I am skeptical of this explanation couched in philosophical terminology because most of these concepts of philosophy were created in the post-Vedic period. Explaining Rudraadhyaaya relying on them looks to me like retrofitting. 

  

Retrofitting has been going on withRudraadhyaaya for the last 2000 years. The Vedic deity Rudra has been totally identified with the post-Vedic deity of Shankara. Terms such asनीलग्रीव, शिव, गिरिश, पशुपति, कपर्दिन्employed in Rudraadhyaaya have been made to agree with later-day mythology of Shankara consuming the Halaahala poison, living on Mount Kailasa. So much so that while Vedic Aryans looked uponशिश्नपूजा with abhorance (Rigveda VII.21.5, X.99.3),लिंगपूजा has become the central tenet of Shaivism.
