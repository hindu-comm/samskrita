One more interesting aspect regarding the odd numbers here:  
If you add seach subsequent number with the sum of previous numbers,  
you will get a square upto 17  
Number - Chamaka - Sum  
1 - 1 - 1  
2 - 3 - (1+3) = 4 =2^2  
3 - 5 - (4+5) = 9 = 3^2  
4 - 7 - (9+7) = 16 = 4^2  
  
and so on upto 17.  
  
I have not been able to figure out the even number suff sequence though.
