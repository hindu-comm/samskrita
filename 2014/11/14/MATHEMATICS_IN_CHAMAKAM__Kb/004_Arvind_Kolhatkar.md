I could also have added in the above that it can be easily proved for any natural number 'n' that the sum of all odd numbers upto the odd number (2n +1) is equal to (n + 1)^2.

  

To see this, recollect the formula of the sum of all natural numbers upto the number 'n' = (n)(n +1) /2. (This is an arithmetical progression with 1 as the first term and 1 as the common difference.)

Therefore, the sum of all natural numbers upto the number (2n + 1) will be (2n + 1)(2n + 2) /2 = (2n +1)(n + 1)

In this sum are included all even numbers starting from 2,4,6 and so on.
If we sum these up and deduct that sum from the sum of all natural numbers upto the number (2n + 1), the remainder will be the sum of all odd numbers upto (2n +1).

Now, 2 + 4 + 6 +.....+ 2n = 2(1 + 2 + 3 +....+n) = 2(n)(n +1)/2 = (n)(n + 1).

Deduct this from the total of all numbers upto (2n + 1) thus:

(2n +1)(n + 1) *minus*(n)(n + 1)  

Take out the common factor(n + 1) . You get

(n + 1) (2n + 1*minus* n) =(n + 1)(n + 1) =(n + 1)^2.
