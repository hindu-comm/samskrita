I do not know algebra or mathematics. All the numerals are used in the  
famine gender should denote some noun in feminine gender and here the  
noun counted is missing.  
  
Please explain what it is or is it generally referring the numbers  
themselves, one, two, three. and it does not stop here only by 17 but  
48 अष्टाचत्वारिंशच्च मे. beginning from चतस्रश्च मे, अष्टौ च मे,  
gradually increased by 4. up to 48 with even numbers list.  
  
As commented these two lists denote the numbers only. While all the  
others words requested are only some thing material or subjective  
things, why these numbers are requested? Please try to find the  
answer. Anyhow, there are numbers beyond 48 and the need to divided  
them into two separate lists? Any reason beyond teaching mathematics?  
or just to teach mathematics?
