# An introduction about the text. AkhyAta-candrikA-

  

Published by Chowkhamba Varanasi, 1997-

written by BhaTTamalla-

Edited by- Pt. Hara govinda Mishra.

  

This is a very useful book on dhAtu-rUpas - a dhAtu kosha called- "AkhyAta candrikA" which enlists all dhAtu-forms according to meaning.

I am giving link of an e-copy to you which I had prepared for my personal use. (If you already know about the text, please ignore.)

But then, please see it and suggest me if the way I am following is right or I can make it better.

  

It is in 3 kAnDas- each again divided into vargas.

  

1st kANDaH- 1. bhAva-vikAra-vargaH, 2. buddhi-vargaH 3. antaHkaraNa-vargaH. 4. vAkkriyA-vargaH 5. dhvani-kriyA-vargaH.

2nd kANdaH- 1. manuShya-chEShTA-vargaH 2. brahma-chEShTA-vargaH 3. kShatriya-chEShTA-vargaH 4. vaiShya-chEShTA-vargaH 5. SUdra-chEShTA-vargaH.

3rd kANDaH- 1. prakIrNaka-vargaH 2. sanAdyanta-vargaH 3. nAnArtha-vargaH 4. Atmane-parasmai pada varga.

  

A meaning is given in saptamI-vibhakti and under that all dhAtu-rUpas (AkhyAtas) are enlisted in tiG forms. Eg. अस्ति, भवति, करोति etc.

Some are also along with upasarga, nipAtA-pUrvaka, Nic-sahita- kaNDvAdi gana, kyac-sahita etc.

  

Digitization plan-

All saptamI-vibhakti-artha words are taken out and made as heading- and AkhyAtas that are mentioned as a shloka are given as list.

Eg. In the book it is thus given- (underlined is the *artha*, of *AkhyAta*in *saptamI*)

### The same becomes this in file-

### 1.1.1. सत्तायाम् –

1. अस्ति

2. भवति

3. विद्यते

### 1.1.2. जन्मनि –

1. उत्पद्यते

2. जायते

3. प्ररोहति

4. उद्भवति

  

(pleasesee image attachment and docx file for detailed look.)

In File till now-

I have typed it according to the division given in the book.

I also gave an index of all the meanings in the beginning.

I have omitted- part later than- 3.2 (Third kANDa -sanAdyanta). (because it could not be handled, and one of my Samskrt brothers accepted to do it in future) Because it is a different arrangement and almost all dhAtus are complete by here.

  

Future plans-

If we could give hyperlinks to the meanings- then we can

1. know all dhAtus giving that particular meanings.

2. Know a particular dhAtu and its meaning.

3. know what upasargas can be used with which dhAtu to give which meaning etc.

And much more.

  

  

If English equivalents are added, then we can make it a searchable file also.

It can be developed as a very good tool.

  

I have added comments where- I did not understand the exact dhAtu, and where there is a mistake possibly in the text and other necessary instances. (My close friend, a Samskrt sister helped me in that. Thanks to her.)

  

Please let me know about any errors (which would have remained in spite of thorough checking several times) through mail or on this document. Also welcome for your feed-back and valuable suggestions. Excuse me for any short comings still left.

(I will come back on this after some time.)

  

Link of the google doc. is as below. (Anyone with the link can comment.)
