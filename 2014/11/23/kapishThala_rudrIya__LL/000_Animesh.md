Namaste ,

In the series of rUdra section of different yaju -shAkhAs , I have post rUdraM of kapishThala shAkhA. kapishThala shAkhA was studied in Maharashtra , Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh.  
The last adherents of this shAkhA surviving in Maharashtra, still refer to this fact in order to enhance their social position.  
There are few handful Brahmans in villages near to nAgapur ( Maharashtra )are last adherent of this shAkhA.  
Even today they recite kapishThala samhitA with svaras .  
Also according to " cArAyanIya pravarAdhyAya " kapishThala is also a gotra .  
( Even today Kashmiri BrAhmans have Bhav Kapishthal gotra , with following surnames:-  
Radu,Kalla, Sapan, Lattu, Kattu, Wantu, Chur, Chudhar,Geeru, Hakin, Wangnu,Shav , Katharu.

Also Bhav Kapishthal Upmanyu is a pravara among Kashmiri pandits .
