नमस्कार,  
  
I have been trying to understand the grammatical function of the word गमय in the well known verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad that begins असतो मा सद्गमय. I looked at the conjugation table for गम् at the INRI Sanskrit Heritage site ([here](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktconjug?lex=MW&q=gam&t=VH&c=1&font=deva)), but it does not mention this form of गम्.  
  
Thanks in advance for the help, and sorry if this is too elementary for this group.  
  
-- पीयूष
