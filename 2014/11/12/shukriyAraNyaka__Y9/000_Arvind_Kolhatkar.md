Friends,

  

I came across the following verse inयाज्ञवल्क्यस्मृति in <http://sa.wikisource.org/> -

  

शुक्रियारण्यकजपो गायत्र्याश्च विशेषतः ।

सर्वपापहरा ह्येते रुद्रैकादशिनी तथा । । ३.३०८ । ।

  

Here, what isशुक्रियारण्यक?

  

I have another doubt stemming from here. Repetition of RudrasUkta eleven times has been prescribed by several other authorities too.
Rudra ia also a form of the god Shankara. Is it likely that the repetition of RudrasUkta eleven times led to the tithi of EkaadashI being associated with Shankara? What else could have led to this association?
