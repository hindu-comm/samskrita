1467 क्षिणु च। उप्रत्ययनिमित्तो लघूपधगुणः। (प) संज्ञापूर्वको विधिरनित्यः इति न भवतीत्यात्रेयादयः। भवत्येवेत्यन्ये। क्षिणोति। क्षेणोति।

There are no two Anga-s, but only one क्षिण but only in one there is लघूपधगुण, and in other there is notलघूपधगुण.

हुश्नुवोः सार्वधातुके॥[६।४।८७](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/6.4.87)\| prohibits अचिश्नुधातु-- etc. उवङ् and यण् is prescribed due to the suffix श्नु.

The above Dhatu-s also do have two forms, like क्षिणोति, क्षेणोति.Here alsoऋणोति, अर्णोति etc,

  

But there is no such prohibition in this case of उ and in both plural, it will take अचिश्नुधातुभ्रुवां उवङ्. But in the first, क्षिण्वति, it is said "हुश्नुवोः सार्वधातुके" इति यण्. In the second, the rule of exception doesn't apply as it is संयोगपूर्व, उकार, अर्णु, and तर्णु. And the यण् doesn't apply and उवङ् comes here. But in क्षिणु -the उकार is असंयोगपूर्व. This is the explanation given in the commentaries.

WhenBhashya says it is for 1st class, why should you differ from Bhashya?

  

(2320)ष्ठिवुक्लमुचमां शिति 7-3-75

एषामचो दीर्घः स्याच्छिति।।।"आङि चम इति वक्तव्यम्।।" आचामति। आङि किम्। चमति। विचमति। अचमीत्।

"चमु छमु जमु झमु अदने" (धा।पा।४६९-४७२) आङ्पूर्वः।

  

  

The दीर्घ is restricted to आचम् and not to any other prefixes or without any prefix.
