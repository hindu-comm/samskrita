ji many thanks for indepth reading.

  

i was informed that 6.4.77 applies here to all dhatus of 8th gana. As it has the word धातु , so it means that any dhatu ending in इकार or उकार will apply this.

  

Anyways, the book Ashtadhyayi Sahajbodha by Dr Pushpa Dikshit lists all the 9+9 forms of Dhatu ऋणु and gives the iii/3 form as अर्णुवन्ति । Somehow it does not indicate the iii/1 form without guna substitution, only giving अर्णोति

  

Whereas the book dhaturupanandini by Janardana Hegde (Samskrita Bharati) gives the forms for ऋणु as ऋणोति/अर्णोति iii/1- अर्णुवन्ति iii/3

  

Still your help is appreciated ji. Pranaams.

ashwini
