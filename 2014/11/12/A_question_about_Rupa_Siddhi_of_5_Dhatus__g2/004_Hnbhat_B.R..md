Yes. I found उवङ् does not apply in this case and hence "हुश्नुवोः सार्वधातुके" also does not apply In his case. The other form is with यण् अर्ण्वन्ति etc. by "इको यणचि".

as given in Siddhantakaumudi, seems to be correct and not अर्णुवन्ति etc.

  

I will confirm little later. The explanation in Balamanorama given in my earlier reply also seems to be wrong as the form itself is wrong.

  

I need some more time to confirm this.
