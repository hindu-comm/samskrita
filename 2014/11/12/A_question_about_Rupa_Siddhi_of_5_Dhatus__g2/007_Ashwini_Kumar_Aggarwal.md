प्रणाम जी,

  

I think i am looking at the Dhatu roopa in the three books that i have might need to be proof read.

I have Dhaturupanandini by Janardana Hegde of Samskrita Bharati, Ashtadhyayi Sahajbodha by Dr Pushpa Dikshit of Pratibha Prakashan and a small pocket book of dhatu roopas in 9+9 forms.

  

In all these 3 books the roopa for iii/3 form for Dhatu ऋण् 8c is given as अर्णुवन्ति ।

  

I asked my part-time Sanskrit teacher and it was told that 6.4.77 applies. However reading your explanation it is clear that 6.4.77 does not apply. Mistake on my part. My apologies.

  

I shall send you a scanned copy of these 3 books pages for your reference.

  

In case you know an authoritative Dhatu roopa Book for all Dhatus that is without printing mistakes, i would be most happy to procure the same.

Or if you know of any such Dhatu book that gives the Panini Sutras for any Dhatu roopa that is out of normal derivation.

I have not used Madhviya Dhatu Vritti. How is that book in your opinion?

  

Thankyou very much.

जय गुरुदेव
