i was informed that 6.4.77 applies here to all dhatus of 8th gana. As it  
has the word धातु , so it means that any dhatu ending in इकार or उकार will  
apply this.  
  

You could have asked how उवङ् - is applied in this case. As I know,  
अचि श्नुधातुभ्रुवां इयङ् is restricted for उवर्णधातु, verbs ending  
with उ only. In these cases, the verbs do not end with उवर्ण, but  
becomes with उ with the suffix and roots do not end with उ. And in  
the case of श्नु, it has been prescribed specifically, as it does not  
come under the general rule and so it takes उवङ्, with उ. and in 8th  
class, it does not apply at all, as it is not covered by श्नु. In this  
case, there is no such prescription for उवङ् for the विकरण suffix उ  
and the धातु-s do not end with उ, but ऋणु तृणु etc. the उ is not  
considered as the part of the roots, like भू, लू, etc. But उकार is  
dropped before the affixation of उ and how the affix उ can take उवङ्  
at all. The वृत्ति specifically state इवर्णोवर्णान्तधातु excluding the  
अनुबन्ध. or any विकरण suffix.  
  
I have been informed that the other form तर्णुवन्ति with उवङ् is wrong.  
  
(271)अचिश्नुधातुभ्रुवां य्वोरियङुवङौ 6-4-77  
श्नुप्रत्ययान्तस्य इवर्णोवर्णान्तधातोर्भ्रू इत्यस्य चाङ्गस्येयङुवङौ  
स्तोऽजादौ प्रत्यये परे । So, when there is no गुण, for the उ, in  
तर्णु+अन्ति, it does not take उवङ्. And hence it takes only यण्, as  
per यणचि. "एरनेकाचोऽसंयोगपूर्वस्य" "ओः सुपि"  
  
Please ask your informer, how the उवङ् is applied to this context and  
not यण्. There are some readings that give उवङ् in this case also.
