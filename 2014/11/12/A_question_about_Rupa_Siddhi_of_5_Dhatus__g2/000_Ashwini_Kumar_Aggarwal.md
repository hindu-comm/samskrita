प्रणाम जी,



I was unable to understand by which Sutra in Ashtadhyayi (or Vartika) the following Dhatu Rupas are made:



1. Dhatus of 8th Conjugation तनादि गण



क्षिणु This seems to have 2 Angas, with and without Guna, as क्षेणु and क्षिणु . Question by which Sutra?



2.Dhatus of 8th Conjugation तनादि गण

ऋणु गतौ

तृणु अदने

घृणु दीप्तौ



These 3 Dhatus seem to have a व् in their iii/1 (3rd person plural forms) as अर्णुवन्ति, तर्णुवन्ति, घर्णुवन्ति .

How is that? The sutra that comes closest is 6.4.77 अचि श्नु-धातु-भ्रुवां य्वोरियङुवङौ Exception to यण् Sandhi whereby इय्/उव् is substituted. However this Sutra applies to the 5c Dhatus and not 8c Dhatus...



3. The Sutra 7.3.75 ष्ठिवु-क्लमु-चमां शिति

We recognise ष्ठिवु as belonging to 1c and 4c andक्लमु as belonging to 1c

However what about चमु?

The Dhatupatha lists two such Dhatus, viz चमु of 1c and चमु of 5c.

MahaBhashya says it should be आ+चमु for 1c Dhatu. Hence आचामति



The Question is what about the चमु belonging to 5c? Why does not it take दीर्घ of its vowel?

As in चम् + ति (लट् iii/1 ) --> चम् + श्नु + ति --\> चम् + नु +ति --\> चाम्नुति ??? The actual rupa is चम्नुति ।



Many Thanks. जय गुरुदेव Ashwini
