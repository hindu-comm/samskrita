Dr Oliver,

  

 Regarding searchable scans -there is one thing that puzzles me.

  

Scanned documents are just graphics, i.e. 'pictures', and as such they aren't searchable.

Yet, your facility magically searches the unsearchable (and very well too!).

  

Now, at my age, I don't believe in magic anymore, so I can only assume that there is an OCR at work behind the scenes, somewhere.

Perhaps one that operates on the fly, which wouldcertainly bewizardry of the computer kind.

  

But, as one who is familiar with your original OCR, from way back (I had eventranslated the German documentationinto English in order to exploreit),I cannot help but wonder, thusly:

  

A document only needs tobe OCR'd the once, and after beingcritically proof read by the Sanskrit professionals and made available for download by one and all,theparchmentsthen exhibited inair conditioned splendour.

  

It is more pleasing to be viewingoriginal text, rather thanbland blackon white text, which would makesuch a technically advanced interface?

  

Regards,
