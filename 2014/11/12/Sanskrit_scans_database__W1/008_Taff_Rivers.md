Dr.

After applying a little **anumāna** to your posting, I realize that you have indeed done some computer wizardry!

I quote:  
This page presents *digitized Sanskrit texts* from the web in a searchable form.

... Clicking on a page name shows the word on the original page.  

*original page*, being the scan of *the page of the book itself*.

Magic!

Taff Rivers.
