Dear all,  
  
\[apologies for cross- or repeated posting!\]  
  
you can find searchable scans of some - currently less than 50 (more information: <http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/sanskrit-scans/overview.htm>) - Sanskrit books at  
<http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/sanskrit-scans/query.php>  
  
Type a word such as sarasvati (this word exactly) or brahmapu\* (all words starting with brahmapu) in the field "Search", and press "Search" (ENTER key does not work at the moment).  
Words contained in the database are displayed in the list below. Click one of the terms you're interested in, and see in which books it occurs. Clicking on a page name shows the word on the original page.  
  
I'm currently expanding the database with new texts, and updates may be released from time to time.  
  
Best wishes, Oliver
