Dear Taff,  
  
yes, it's one version of the Sanskrit OCR that is responsible for the scans. Of course, the best solution would be to use ground truth data; but time is definitely a factor: Correcting them manually is time consuming (although you can read them in this way), and there are simply too many Sanskrit texts, even if we restrain ourselves to the printed ones.  
  
Best wishes, Oliver
