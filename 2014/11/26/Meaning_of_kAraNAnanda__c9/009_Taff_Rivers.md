 I don't see too much context in these replies.

  

This site [**http://www.manblunder.com**](http://www.manblunder.com/2013/09/sri-chakra-navavarana-puja)lists**kāraṇānanda** **from sri-chakra-navavarana-puja**

  

Even so,the 'subtle resonances' are left to the imagination...

**22.3) Āvāhana mantra-s:**

  

Āvāhana means invitation or invocation. By using certain mantras and mudras, the Divine Couple are invited from within to be seated in the midst of Śri Cakra along with Her retinue.

Following is the mantra.

4 ह्स्रैं ह्स्क्ल्रीम् ह्स्रौः।

महापद्मवनान्दस्ते **कारणानन्द** विग्रहे ।

सर्वभूतहिते मातः एह्येहि परमेश्वरि ॥

श्रीललितामहात्रिपुर्सुन्दरी पराभट्टारिका महाकामेशर समेत आवाह्यामि ॥

4 hsraiṁ hsklrīm hsrauḥ \|

mahāpadmavanāndaste **kāraṇānanda** vigrahe \|

sarvabhūtahite mātaḥ ehyehi parameśvari \|\|

śrīlalitāmahātripursundarī parābhaṭṭārikā mahākāmeśara sameta āvāhyāmi \|\|

　

Now place the flowers now being held in trikhaṇḍā in the centre of Śri Cakra.

Now the Divine Couple are seated in Śri Cakra.

If they are contemplated well within and properly invited to be seated in the midst of Śri Cakra, at the time of taking Their seat, subtle resonances can be felt in the maṇḍala where Śri Cakra is kept.

　

**śrī**-**cakra**  
• *n.* a magical diagram (supposed to represent the orb of the earth), *RTL. 196; 203*.
