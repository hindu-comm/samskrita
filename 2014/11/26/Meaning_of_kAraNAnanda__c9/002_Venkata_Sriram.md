says the kulArNava tantra.

  

The Brahman is of the form of Absolute Bliss which is inside us; which makes this bliss to manifest externally is called "madya". The great yogis drink this wine called "Absolute Bliss". Hence, the "madya" is called kAraNa Ananda or kAraNa sudha.

  

For pashu & vIra sAdhakas, this madya takes the crude form in the form of intoxicant and there are several methods prescribed to prepare it which is out of the context to discuss.

  

regs,
