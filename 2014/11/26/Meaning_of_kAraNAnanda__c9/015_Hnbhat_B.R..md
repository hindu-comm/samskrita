Sorry I forgot to add the link to the dictionary:  
  
<http://www.kundalini-tantra.com/gloss1.html>  
  
This book in the internet archives seem to give more information on  
this aspect::  
  
<https://archive.org/details/mahanirvanatantram>  
  
"Mahanirvanatantra"  
  
Here is another translation of the Stotra:  
  
Karanananda-japeshta = Deity of those who Worship with Wine.  
  
<http://yoniversum.nl/daktexts/kalistotra.html>  
  
But it does not translation. It seems to translate Karanananda- itself  
as the wine.  
  
But for this, the translation seems to be closer. The loved one by  
those who worship with कारणानन्द.
