Dear list members,

  

I need the meaning ofkāraṇānanda . I have seen on a website that this is translated as "bliss of drinking a kind of wine". But on looking in MW and Apte I've been unable to find a translation of kāraṇa or kāraṇā as a kind of wine. Can any of the members confirm its meaning as "a kind of mind" or give me the correct translation.

  

Many thanks,

Harry Spier
