Namaste

Anunad Singh from Technical Hindi group makes a wonderful correcter for Devanagari simple mistakes or change issues.

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/technical-hindi>

It is very useful. I tried it. Works good.

In case the font on the correcter is not properly visible, (in firefox) please go to Menu>View>Character Encoding>Unicode and it will all appear. (Similar adjustment in chrome, I suppose.)

It is one step correcter for many issues. Provision for Varga panchamas is most interesting for Samskrt people.

In combination with
[learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript](http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript)
-this tool, one can make many issues solvable, I suppose.
