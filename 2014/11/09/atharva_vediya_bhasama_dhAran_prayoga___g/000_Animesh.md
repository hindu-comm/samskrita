Srī mātre namah

Namaste ,

Wearing of bhasma / vibhuti is one of basic ritual in our smArta sampradaya.  
Bhasama dharan is small but very auspicious ritual which nullifies all the sins and purifies our mind and body .( if done with bhakti and sradhhA ).My following post provides a step by step procedure ( with mantras in full ) of bhasma dhAran in accordance with atharva veda tradition.  
I request all members to visit it .  
I'd their is any query , question then please mail me.
