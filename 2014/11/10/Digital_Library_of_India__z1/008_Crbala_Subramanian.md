Hi All

  

Greetings to everyone.

  

For the past two days, DLI is not responding properly. Every time I tried searching for some books I get request timed out. recent times this is happening frequently.

  

Is there any way to take this message to DLI. the common mail id given in DLI site, despite sending message frequently no response from them.

  

Thanks

C.R.Bala
