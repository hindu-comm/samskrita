Speaking of digital collections and the ease of using them, I would commend the digital library of the Osmania University, [oudl.osmania.ac.in](http://oudl.osmania.ac.in) , which is very easy to search and books are downloadable as pdf files. Access is open to anyone. Are there any other universities or academic bodies which have similar collections? If so, anyone aware of them may please share the URL's here.

  

The purpose of digitizing old books is to make them widely available to the world. An old book, whose few surviving copies would have remained locked on shelves of unknown libraries, are thereby given a new lease of life. In this spirit, a digital library, especially one funded by public money, should be be made easily accessible to any user. The DLI is doing just the opposite. There are making it as difficult as possible for the readers to use their collection. Besides, there effort is pitifully meager. After almost 10 years of work, they have digitized only about 4,000 books each of Kannada and Marathi. while thousands of other books in these languages are waiting on shelves for their turn.
Compare this with [archive.org](http://archive.org). The chance of finding an out-of-print old book there is far greater than with DLI.

  

With bodies like IIT's behind it, why is DLI managed in so poorly?
India is supposed to be an IT super-power. Why is its government-funded digital library so shabbily run?
