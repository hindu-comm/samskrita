Dear Friends,

  

I have been a regular user of several digital libraries, such as [archive.org](http://archive.org), [scribd.com](http://scribd.com), DLI etc. Among these three, I find that [archive.org](http://archive.org) is the easiest to use and the most user-friendly. I Any book in their vast collection can be instantly read online or can be downloaded in minutes in any of their several formats. The experience with DLI is the worst.
The site is down very often. Even when it is running, it does not respond to a request sent to it. You see in their collection a book you would love to have but reaching to it is almost impossible. I am writing this mail to know what are your experiences with DLI and whether we can collectively act to bring our problems to the attention of the administrators of DLI. I am sure many members of this Group rely on DLI for old books about Indian History, Religion, Sanskrit studies etc.

  

I have so far managed with the help of two freeware DLI downloader programs - DLI Downloader 024 available at [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) anddli-downloader-5.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar. I was usually able to download books by using one of these, albeit with several frustrating breakdowns of connections etc Of late I find that now DLI does not respond to either of these two. Now the only way I can download a book is by downloading individual pages in the .tif format, which the only format in which DLI provides its material. This method is very labor-intensive and time consuming. A 300-page book takes up several hours of patient work, a task that can be achieved on [orchive.org](http://orchive.org) in minutes. Sometimes, DLI refuses to send even the .tif images, making its role totally irrelevant for its potential users.

  

I would be very thankful for suggestions tips about how to use these above-mentioned softwares, in case I am missing someting. Let me also state that I am not very tech-savvy as computers came into my life very late.

  

Arvind Kolhatkar.
