It is quite amusing to see the goals change from "don't download 2.1 million pages" to "don't go against fair use" to "don't misuse" all based on imaginary fears of legality. All baseless and scaremongering claims.

The reason one saw the copyright notice and FAQ section was to confirm whether the fears were well founded. Turns out that they weren't. One is at a loss to understand the a priori assumption that the poor vidvaan going to DLI is out to misuse it.

Sir, please go ahead and use the DLI in any which way you want. It is a repository of out of copyright books set up with my and your money. Specially use the DLI downloader, a splendid software.
