I don't think Mr. Gargeshwari read svaami's post correctly. He didn't mean to say that dli has given the downloader. Secondly, there is no bar on the number of books one can download from the site.

My experience with dli has been exasperating too. I had written the following sometime ago in another forum and it still stands:  
------------  
The actual problem in the DLI is not so much about downloading images. downloading images can be done in various ways (i use orbit downloader). But the criminality of their work has been:  
total callousness in naming books: There has been no naming standard. R^igveda has been named as Rigveda, Rgveda, Rugveda etc. Not limited to names of works, it extends to names of people as well.  
not allowing google to index but having their own search. Their whole interface sucks!!!No plan in scanning: Multi volume books have different versions and some volumes are missing Eg. in the Vedic Concordance (12 vols) of Vasubandhu, i was able to locate at least two copies of 3 volumes each, the other volumes are missing. Some scans are truncated at the top, bottom, right, left (this was in earlier scans, the later scans seem ok).Some scans are unnecessarily large (some individual pages containing only text are larger than 200k).  
Another instance of tax-payers money gone down the drain. Any high-school student team would have done a better job.
