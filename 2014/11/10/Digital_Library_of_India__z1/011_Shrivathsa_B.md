I don't have the mind-reading capabilities of yours but can see that the svaami indeed explained his response in the light of your post, something which you not only ignored, but claimed to understand the previous post on the grounds of it being written in English. The least you could have done is to retract the claim that you understood his post well. At least when it was demonstrated to you that you misunderstood.

I am not in the habit of giving uninvited and free suggestions. Else, I would have asked you to take a few deep breaths before you click the send button, a hundred more before composing a mail and a thousand more while reading mails written by others.
