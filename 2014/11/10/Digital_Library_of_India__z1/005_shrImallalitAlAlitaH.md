Read the last sentence as:  

I'm very happy with DLI, provided this software is with me.  
  

I'm collecting since 6 years, when this software was not available. So, I hope this doesn't cause DLI shutdown!!!  
  

Many books were available in early days of DLI which were marked copyrighted later. So, if you see any book listed on DLI, it is better to have it as soon as possible. You may not share them publicly, but they could be shared in other ways for benefit of scholars/students.  

I can't imagine my study without soft copies of books from these digital libraries. Actually, now I've hardly any hard copy of books needed.Thanks to these libraries and friends who share these with me.
