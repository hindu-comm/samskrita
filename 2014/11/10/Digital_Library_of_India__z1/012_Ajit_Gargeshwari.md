Dear Shrivatsa,  
One last post. For me this topic is closed  
You may not be aware DLI downloader is an illegal Software. As Per law one must not do automatic downloads from any web site including Batch downloads without the written permission of the website owner in this case it DLI or Goverment of India. So publicly saying I have downloaded 7000 books does not sound correct. 7000 books means around 2.1 million pages or of tif images considering a book has an average 300 images. I think and I write
