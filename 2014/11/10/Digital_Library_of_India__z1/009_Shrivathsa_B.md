Mr. Gargeshwari,

"provided" means things such as "in case", "on the condition". Its usage is common in sentences such as :  
"I will come provided there are tickets available".  
Which means "I will come in case there are tickets available". Or "I will come on the condition that tickets are available".

So indeed you have failed to understand a well cast sentence. What svaami's second sentence means is "I'm very happy with DLI in case this software is with me." (Note: "provided" replaced with "in case"). I have been reading svaami for some time now and I haven't seen him make mistakes of the sort that you seek to impute.

If a meaning such as the one you have imputed to the sentence is to be extracted, the sentence would have to be non-grammatic.

I am willing to give you many more examples but will stop here for the fear of making this forum an aa\~Ngla sandesha shreNiH. But to whatever extent this mail was helpful, I will be happy.
