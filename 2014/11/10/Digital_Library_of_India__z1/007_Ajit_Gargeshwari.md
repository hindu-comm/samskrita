It is still working and I've more than 7000 books from DLI only. I'm very happy with DLI provided this software is with me.  
  

This what I said I have understood what the swami said . The second sentence means DLI is providing software and I said DLI is not providing any software its athird part utililty all DLI downloaders. So please don't tell me I fail to understand an English sentence Thanks
