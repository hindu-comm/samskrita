Namaste  
  
DLI intermittently goes out of order; it was - just a couple of days ago; frustrating indeed.  
  
DLI has multiple sites  
  
<http://202.41.82.144/>  
[http://www.dli.gov.in](http://www.dli.gov.in/)  
<http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/>  
<http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/>  
[http://www.dli.ernet.in](http://www.dli.ernet.in/)  
  
fastest to not-so-fast in that order (in my experience)  
  
If a book is not accessible in one site (responses like "Access denied:, "You have no permission", "page not found" etc), it may well be available in another. You need to try with alternate sites.  
  
For downloading multiple pages, the easiest way would be to use the Free Download Manager (FDM) (<http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/>), Install the s/w  
Assuming you have Firefox browser  

-   Open any page of the book you want to download -   Right click on the page and click "Copy Image Location" (If a FDM
    widow pop's up at this moment, just close it), Also note the number
    of pages (NP) shown at the bottom of page.  
-   Open FDM's widow by left-clicking on FDM's ICON in systray -   Click Downloads->Create batch download -   Paste the page's URL; some thing like
    <http://www.dli.gov.in/data/upload/0047/752/PTIFF/00000004.tif>.
    Change the page no to (\*). The edited URL will look
    <http://www.dli.gov.in/data/upload/0047/752/PTIFF/(*).tif>  
-   In the "Set Of Numbers" set the value to 1-NPw8 eg. 1-522w8 -
    (means, the \* above, takes values from 1 to 522, the width of page
    numbers will be 8; page 1 will be 00000001, page 522 will be 0000522 -   Set the o/p directory "Save to Folder" to your choice -   Press OK

That's it.

Get back if any more clarifications are required.

Venkatesh
