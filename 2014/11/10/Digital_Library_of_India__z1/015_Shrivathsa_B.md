There is no such fair use policy delineated on the site. It is you who has to disabuse yourself of the pretensions of being a legal expert. If you don't have a legal document to back up your claim that downloading 7000 books over a period of several years violates the fair use policy, please stop claiming so. Let me advise you here (a la your advice to me) to stop being a spokesman for DLI. I am sure they have paid people who do it.

I acknowledge your second claim on a mail being the last post from you. If you make unsubstantiated claims, I will write again.

Your scaremongering is unfounded and your lack of acknowledgment of your misunderstanding even when proved beyond doubt is in bad taste.
