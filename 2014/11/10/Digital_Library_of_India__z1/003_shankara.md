Kolhatkarji,

  

When custom made softwares like DLI Downloader don't work, you can make use of any batch downloader like IDM or FDM to batch-download scanned images from DLI. Another option is to use Firefox addons like 'batchdownload' or 'downthemall'. They automate the process of downloading images from DLI. PDF creation will have to be done by us manually.



regards  
shankara
