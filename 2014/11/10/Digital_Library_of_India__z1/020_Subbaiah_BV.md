I'm also facing this problem with DLI for several months. Most of the time, their servers are down.. It's poorly managed.  

  
(Btw, there's no legal issue / nor fair usage policy.. We can download as many books as we wish. If I'm refreshing their webpages / downloading their documents - just for fun, just with the intention of increasing the load on their servers - Then, I'm misusing it. But, I feel, none of the members in this group are doing that. We have all joined this group with an interest to learn something new. Anyway, we can leave this discussion here. The main problem is with the DLI servers).

नास्ति विद्यासमं चक्षुः, नास्ति सत्यसमं तपः ।  
नास्ति रागसमं दुःखं, नास्ति त्यागसमं सुखम् ॥  
There is no eye equal to knowledge; there is no penance parallel to truth;  
There is no pain akin to desire; there is no happiness synonymous to renunciation/sacrifice.
