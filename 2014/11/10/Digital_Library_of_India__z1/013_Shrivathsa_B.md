So now the goal post shifts from English to legality. No word of acknowledgement that you had indeed misunderstood svaami. You seem (until proven otherwise) wrong even here (the legality scare).

The FAQ section of DLI has nothing about multiple downloads being illegal. Secondly, all the books in dli are out of copyright. If anyone makes a claim, such a book will be taken down by dli authorities.

I think you are fighting phantoms. Even if one were to download 200 million pages, according to the terms available on the site, it is not illegal.

We will be very grateful if you were to send us the exact clause of the copyright act or any other act / law which makes multiple downloads from dli illegal. Until then, pl stop scaremongering.
