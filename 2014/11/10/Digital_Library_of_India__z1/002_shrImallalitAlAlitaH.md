I'm using Munish Chandel's DLI Downloader version 5.9, i.e. dli-downloader-5.9-jar-

with-dependencies.jar. It needs Java 8.  

It is still working and I've more than 7000 books from DLI only. I'm very happy with DLI provided this software is with me.  

BTW, I've noted that the software sometimes fails to show some barcodes. That's not a problem, as it can download them even if it doesn't list them as available on DLI.
