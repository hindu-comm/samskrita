juhurāṇa

  

\[L=21409\] \[p= 3142\] juhurāṇa¦ pu0 . *hurccha--san--ānaca sano luk chalopaśca .*

*

1 candre pu0 ujjvala0 . 2 ***kauṭilyakāriṇi t***ri0 .

  

*“yuyo-*

*dhyasmajjuhurāṇamenaḥ”* Unadi sUtra 2.91*.' “juhurāṇaṁ kuṭila-*

*kāriṇam” bhāṣyam .*

  

This is the explanation of the word, juhurāṇa, from the verb हुर्छा कौटिल्ये with the above UnadiSutra. 2-91 हुर्छे: सनो लुक् छलोपश्च ॥ जुहुराणश्चन्द्रमा: । used in this context as adjective, of एनस्. as nount it is used to mean the moon. Here in this context, it is
explained with कुटिलगतिकारिणि in the Bhashya.

  

If you do not want to deviate from the above verb, you can get the same, from ह्वृ कौतिल्ये, as Vedic usage. The above derivation is based on the उणादिसूत्र.
