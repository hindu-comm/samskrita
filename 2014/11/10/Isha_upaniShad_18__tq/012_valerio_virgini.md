Dear Taff

I am becoming aware of the difficulty encountered by approaching these works Vedic.  
But their charm pushes me to go deeper.  
Although I try to catch their beauty from the point of view of prosody, I'm sure I will not be able.  
I can only hope to capture their "strength" of poetry, but to do that you need to understand the meaning of each word and semantic nuances.

This work is not poetry ... this is similar to the business, but a deep understanding of arid terms, leads to the "sphoṭa" of poetry.  
At least I hope !!!

  

ciao

valerio
