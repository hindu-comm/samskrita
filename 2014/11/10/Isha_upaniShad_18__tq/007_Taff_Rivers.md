hnbhat,

  

"I too request the derivation of the word from ह्वृ grammatically by any Paninian rule for Vedic grammar."

  

  

*VS. &c.* (*see* above): *Caus. hvārayati* (*aor. jihvaraḥ*, *°ratam*; *juhuraḥ*, *juhūrthāḥ*, *juhurāṇa*)

There are of course, a number of Vedic Grammars , V(ājasaneyi) S(aṃ-hitā) , some at least of which apparently recognise the conjunction.

As to **Pāṇini's** version, is *Dhātup. xxxi, 21*, of relevance?

　

I can only go by what I read in the Lexicon, a **Sanskṛt** Grammarian, I am not.

　

Taff
