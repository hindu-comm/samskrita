Valerio,

  

 Indeed, the nuances are of the greatestimportant. For with the romantic, the fun is in the chase, and when those nuances are from the most ancient of culturesthe chase is eternal, as most as lost in the mists of time.

  

As one of the curious ones, but unable to wait that long, I attemptedthe ultimate goal the hard way, *Tatra sthitau yatnaḥ-abhyāsaḥ.*

or as they say in the RAF*Per Ardua Ad Astra\*,* I took themoredirect routeĪśvara-praṇidhānāt vā. as perthe unpoeticdarśanas,

thereby to experience draṣṭuḥ svarūpe-avasthānam.

  

Ivery unromantically equate it with the well documented NDE (near death experience). In my case, the tunnel,the white light(clear, like air, not white like snow) of pureconsciousness, (but no angels, dead ancestors etc.).

  

It is certainly beyond thenormal state of consciousness. However, there is literally nothing to see, nothing to hear. It is, after all,beyond the realm of the senses.There is not even a sense of their absence. Likewisewiththe emotions, non existent!

  

Once you've beenthere - well, again,as the man says, there is nothing more to know!

  

And then there's theOBE (out of body experience).Theman not only saysthat birth is the cause of the selfbeing embodied,Bhava-pratyayaḥ videha-prakṛtilayānām, which is not really news to anyone, but he also shows point the outpath toliberation.Śraddhā-vīrya-smṛti-samādhi-prajñā-pūrvakaḥ itareṣām,But there's thehard part again,vīrya!

  

That is how to *harness* the intellect (mental energy itself), butthat alone it neither here nor there. Practicing theefficient employment of such, begins in Chaper III.Endless is this yatna.

*\*Per Ardua Ad Astra,*Through hardship to the stars. Not Sanskrit of course butyour Latin. However even here, there is noexact

translation *Through adversity to the stars*, is another.

(I was in that service for nine years, plenty of the *ardua* stuff, nota single *Astra*!)
