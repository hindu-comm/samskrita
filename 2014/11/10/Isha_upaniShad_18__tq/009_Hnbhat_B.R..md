aorist participle? Not mentioned by Panini as far as I can recollect. It could be the past perfect participle कानच्. used in Vedic text and the base inflected like that of past perfect लिट्. I am not sure.If you mean by aorist the same mood as denoted लिट्, it could be possible.

I do not know it is causative form. The Causative form would be ह्वरयति, ह्वरयते - and the participle from the causative would be ह्वरयाणः and not जुहुराणः.

No. It is परस्मैपद only. Only the suffix could be चानश् or कानच्. like चक्राण, from कृ.

  

ह्वृ -+ कानच्।

  

duplication of the setm as in लिट्. The other suffix चानश् needs आत्मनेपद or परस्मैपद, but it will take duplication of the verb used in the 3rd class. Anyhow there is no restriction of Panini's rules on Vedic words as for Classical Literature. This much might have been meant by MW.

  

जुहुर्+आन \> जुहुराणः could be the form. I am not sure of the detailed process of the derivation. Somebody may confirm.The meaning doesn't change.

This the root given the commentators. Mahidhara Bhasshya ---

which explicitly shows the derivation of the word from the root used in the 3rd class, as present participle. In that much change of class, it is Vedic usage, but I am not sure of the derivational process.

  

With regards
