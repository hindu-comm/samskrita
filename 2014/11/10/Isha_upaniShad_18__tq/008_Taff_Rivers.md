Valerio,

  

 You are delving deep into an esoteric topic.

  

Just to give you an idea of what you are asking.

  

The companion volumeto the MW lexicon,*MW's Grammar*,uses the term *preterite.*

  

*Whitney,* has a whole chapter (XI)on the subject (*the* *aorist system*), where there are sub categories, and sub categories of sub categories...

In his(*Whitney)* companion volume of verbal root forms, you may find hvṛ, as its very last entry (Page 210).

  

As to what all this stuff actually means, good luck! Very few of today's humans would understand, let alonewant to.

  

Thematerial you are reading is poetic, the realm of the heavens and pleasure - for thesenses,

as opposed tothe prosaic,the realm ofreality andrules -for the intellect.

  

They are at cross purposes with each other, like Pleasure and business.

  

Therules of thesegrammars arevery curious indeed!

  

Regards,

  

 Taff.
