Thank you very much for the useful clarification.  
  
It could be an aorist participle?  
Which is then declined like an adjective.  
MW says it is a causative form: from what you know it's a causative form?  
In this type of adjective, there is a diathesis (ātmanepada or parasmaipada)?  
  
thanks  
valerio
