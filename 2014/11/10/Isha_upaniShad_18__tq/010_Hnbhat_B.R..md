But Mahidhara, goes by the Vedic grammar and recognized the form,as derived from a different verb,हुर्च्छा कौटिल्ये, on the same वाजसनेयी संहिता, of which ईशावास्योपनिषत् is the last Chapter. Mahidhara has commented on the complete वाजसनेयी संहिता, and not dependent on any Lexicon, by Monier Williams or Petersburg Lexicon. And not शाकटायन too who offered a clear derivational process for the word, from हुर्छा and not from any modern Lexicon. and Indian Lexicons शब्दकल्पद्रुम, and वाचस्पत्य accept the same verb and give the same derivation without any place for doubt.

  

For Vedic grammar, there are प्रातिशाख्य-s related tothe relevant branches of Veda-s. or संहिता-s, and the derivation offered on thewords rely on those given byNighantu and Nirukta, which is complementary text for Vediclearning, along with Panini's Ashtadhyayi. These arethe sources for the commentators for reference.उणादिसूत्र-s prior to Panini, is another source for the derivation of words including Vedic ones accepted by Panini and यास्क as approved. "उणादयो बहुलम्" by Panini also.



  

I have given the possible derivation from the verb ह्वृ as given by MW as I know Panini's grammar as I could not guess what MW mean.
