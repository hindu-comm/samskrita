hnbhat,

  

 It would seem to be adebate that has been ongoing for milleniums, in one form or another:

  



If I may quote from what wikipedia has to say on the subject regarding Yāska etc.


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C4%81ska](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C4%81ska)

I quote:

  

As in modern [*semantic theory*](http:///wiki/Semantics), Yāska views words as the main carriers of meaning. This view – that words have a primary or preferred ontological status in defining meaning, was fiercely debated in the Indian tradition over many centuries. The two sides of the debate may be called the *Nairuktas* (based on Yāska's Nirukta, [*atomists*](http:///wiki/Atomism)), vs the [*Vaiyākarans*](http:///wiki/Vyakarana) (grammarians following Pāṇini, [*holists*](http:///wiki/Holism)), and the debate continued in various forms for twelve centuries involving different philosophers from the [*Nyaya*](http:///wiki/Nyaya), [*Mimamsa*](http:///wiki/Mimamsa) and [*Buddhist*](http:///wiki/Buddhist) schools.

**. . .**

This debate relates to the atomistic vs holistic interpretation of linguistic fragments – a very similar debate is raging today between traditional [*semantics*](http:///wiki/Semantics) and [*cognitive linguistics*](http:///wiki/Cognitive_linguistics), over the view whether words in themselves have semantic interpretations that can be composed to form larger strings. The cognitive linguistics view of semantics is that any definition of a word ultimately constrains it meanings because the actual meaning of a word can only be construed by considering a large number of individual contextual cues.

End quote

  

  

The problem is thosemilleniums worth of contextual cues lost in the mists of time,not least to the16th-century Mahīdhara.
