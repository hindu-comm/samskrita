There are rules for compound formation according to which समास and not samas.

  

Please give in Devanagari, the correct words and not in English in with wrong spellings, and with the context in which the compounds are used.

स्थितप्रज्ञः ---

  

प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् ।

आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः *स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ॥२- ५५॥*  

*  
*

*The stable minded* is the one, who has forsaken all desires and fluttering of the mind. Oh Arjuna, and becomes content and happy with his soul seeking pleasure only from the soul.  

*  
*

*स्थिता*प्रज्ञा यस्य सः - स्थितप्रज्ञः।

  

Please provide the context in Devanagari, like above, for all the words you have listed. The above is in the context of Bhagavadgita. It may differ in other contexts. So please provide the full sentence.
