Hello,

I have a few doubts regarding Samas and it's Vigrahas

Without Vigrah of Samas how can we define the category of the Samas? As far as I know, category of the Samas depends upon it's Vigrah. So according to that, any one Samas can be put into two or three categories depending upon it's Vigraha.

E.g.-  Ekamas can be seen as both Karmadharya and Dwigu depending on how we break it. How can we explain this anomaly.

Also, can you help me with the Vigrahas of these words-

1\. Sthitapragya

2\. Prayojankritam

3\. Snanartham

4\. Sagaram

5\. Svagriham

6\. Haryashti
