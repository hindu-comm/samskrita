Just wanted to share this:

Devas once had a doubt about the samasa of Rameswara: whether it is tatpurusha or bahuvreehi

They went to Vishnu. He told, "No doubt! It is tatpurusha statingरामस्य ईश्वर; रामेश्वर:

Devas thoughtsinceVishnu is Gunapoorvanan he tells that way.

Then they went to shiva. He told it is bahuvreehi stating -मम ईश्वर: राम:

Devas were now utterly confused.

Then they went to Brahma for clarification.

he told - It is karmadharaya -रामश्च असौ ईश्वरश्च रामेश्वर:

  

Depicts both Shiva & Vishnu as one.
