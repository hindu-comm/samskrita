I want the correct shloka words-

sarvendriyani sayamya bakavat patito janah---------------- This shlok is from Nitisar composed by Chankya.

  

  

Can I get the correct translation of the shlok -

Apurvoayam maya drishta kant kamallochane

shoantaram yo vijanati sa vidvannatra samshaya.

This is a riddle. I want to know the correct meaning of sho.

Thanks
