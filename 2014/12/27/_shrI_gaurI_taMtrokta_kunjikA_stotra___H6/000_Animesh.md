SrI mAtre namaH

Namaste ,

This topic is quit unfamiliar with our group but due to its intense rarity I'm sharing this.  
Gauri tantra belongs to kashmir trika tantras ( pashimAnya kubjika sampradaya ) .This is rare and pure version of kunjika stotra which is recited with devimahAtmaya .

( This was given to me, while a discussion on kashmira trika system by a pupil of SrI bAbA dabrala .  
He is one of bhairava siddha and master in Kashmir trika system . )

  
Regards  
Animesh
