Dear friends,

  

Namaste.

  

I am sorry, if I post something irrelevant to the group. The moderator may delete this email, if he feels so.

  

Is there anyone who can do the proof reading of some Sanskrit books, which we are planning to publish? The person should know Tamil and Sanskrit. This work is for some charitable / spiritual organization.

  

If you can do the same, please send me private email.

  

Thank you.

With regards,

Radhakrishnan.
