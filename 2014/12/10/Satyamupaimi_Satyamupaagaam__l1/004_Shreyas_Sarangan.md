Dear Sri Ramesh,

  

It is a popular, but incorrect perception that the pitr-tarpanam of bramha-yagnam is to be done

only by those without a father.

  

I have had the good fortune of confirming from many traditional vedic vidwans that this pitr-tarpanam

of the bramha-yagna nitya-karma is to be done by all.

  

We can discuss offline if you need more information.

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
