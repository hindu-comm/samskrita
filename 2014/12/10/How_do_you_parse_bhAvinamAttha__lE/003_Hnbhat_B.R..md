Here is the text and the translation of the complete verse;

  

svalpāṁtaraṁ yasya vapurmuneḥ syādbahvadbhutaṁ yasya ca janma dīptam \|

yasyottamaṁ bhāvinamāttha cārthaṁ taṁ prekṣya kasmāttava dhīra vāṣpaḥ \|\| 1.68 (1.63)

  

68\. ‘One whose beauty has little to distinguish it from that of a divine sage, 38 and whose brilliant birth has been so wonderful, and *for whom thou hast prophesied a transcendent future, — wherefore, on seeing him, do tears come to thee, O reverend one?*
