Please give the relevant verse or phrase only instead of giving any other parsing.

  

भाविनम्+आत्थ is very normal structure.

  

**yasya + uttamaṁbhāvinam ātthaca(ā) arthaṁ taṁ prekṣya kasmāt tava dhīra bāṣpaḥ?**

**  
**

**Seeing the best future goal you say, why there is your tear(s)?**

**  
**

**This seems to be the meaning of the sentence.**
