When I saw this question the following declension of the rootब्रू (2 A P), learnt in school, came up from memory:

  

1st person ब्रवीमि ब्रूव: ब्रूम:

2nd person ब्रवीषि (आत्थ) ब्रूथ: (आहथु:) ब्रूथ

3rd person ब्रवीति (आह) ब्रूत: (आहतु:) ब्रुवन्ति(आहु:)

  

My question to scholars is where do these irregular forms likeआत्थ, आहथु: etc. come from? Is there any background to them. Perhaps Dr Bhat has the answer.
