Sorry. I didn't answer to your question completely. Regarding the 5 forms, of the verb ब्रू.

  

The quoted सूत्र, makes the form by substiting both the root ब्रू with आह and the present tense five suffixes, with those substitutions prescribed for लिट् in परस्मैपद धातु-s only i.e.णल्, अतुस्, उस्। थल्, अथुस् for the five तिप्, तस्, झि, सिप्, थस् परस्मैपद suffixes, used for the present tense. That is how you get the extra five forms in परस्मैपद only.

  

There is another root completely taking these present tense suffixes replaced by those prescribed for लिट् optionally. The forms of present tense, for the विद् - giving both forms optionally in the present tense.

  

The normal forms in present tense for the above root:

  

वेत्ति, वित्तः, विदन्ति। वेत्सि, वित्थः, वित्थ। वेद्मि, विद्वः, विद्मः।
with optional form  

वेद, विदतुः, विदुः। वेत्थ, विदथुः, विद। वेद, विद्व, विद्म।  

  

This is just for additional information of these forms. These are not to be confused with लिट् other लिट् forms in परस्मैपद roots

  

बभूव - बभूवतुः, बभूवुः etc. The लिट् form of विद् is similar, but with duplication of

  

  

विवेद · विविदतुः · विविदुः ·

विवेदिथ · विविदथुः · विविद।

विवेद · विविदिव · विविदिम.

विद (ज्ञाने, अदादिगण, परस्मै, लुट्).  

  

In लिट्, the same विद् has got another set of forms also.

  

विदाम्+चकार चक्रतुःचक्रुः

चकर्थ -चकरिथ,चक्रथुः चक्र

चकार-चकर, चकृव. चकृम।

  

resulting in विदांचकार etc. with the same forms of कृ in लिट्, in परस्मैपद.

  

विदांबभूव etc. like that of भू धातु, in लिट्.

विदामास etc. those of अस् - in लिट्.
