I could not understand what do you mean प्ररम्परा. It simply means the succession of disciplines, through transfering the teachings. It does not stand alone.

  

सदाशिवसमारम्भां शङ्कराचार्यमध्यमाम् । अस्मदाचार्यपर्यन्तां वन्दे गुरुपरम्पराम् ।

  

This the परम्परा of the teachers. There is no such relation between the names you have suggested and it does not necessarily denote the system parampara as you seem to mean. The names a chronological order and it is different from the आचार्यपरम्परा, or गुरुपरम्परा. The word is translated loosely as tradition or strictly as succession. The names have got only chronological order and not any other such succession.
