The vicki page article seems to be contradicting and misleading.

In spite of the verse quoted in the Sudhakara commentary, it is not reliable for taking उव्वटas the brother of Kaiyata. as Uvvata, mentions his father as वज्रटand resident of आनन्दपुर, during the reign of Bhoja, according to the colophons of his Bhashya.

  

The two sources above raise the question, the names जैयट and वज्रट are referring to the same person? If not, how can Kaiyata and UvvaTa could be brothers?
