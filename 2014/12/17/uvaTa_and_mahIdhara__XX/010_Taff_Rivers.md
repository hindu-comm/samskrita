hnbhat,

  

  

\<==

 The vicki page article seems to be contradicting and misleading

In spite of the verse quoted in the Sudhakara commentary, it is not reliable for taking उव्वटas the brother of Kaiyata. as Uvvata, mentions his father as वज्रटand resident of आनन्दपुर, during the reign of Bhoja, according to the colophons of his Bhashya.

  

The two sources above raise the question, the names जैयट and वज्रट are referring to the same person? If not, how can Kaiyata and UvvaTa could be brothers?

  

\<==  

  

  

Sir,all these articles are open to peer review and editing!

  

Whilst I am confident when it comes to computer matters, having worked there in research and development, I can but go by what I read on the page when it comes to biographical data ofthe venerable ancients.

  

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers
