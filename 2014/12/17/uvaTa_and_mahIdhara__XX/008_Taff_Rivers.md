Latin Lady,

  

 Kātyāyana, as well as commentating on some Vedic sutra, was also a grammarian.

  

It is in that sense only, wherehe can be said to followa particularline (of successive grammarians).

  

  

The Upaniṣads and so on, arepoetry of a mystic kind, whereas grammar is something elseentirely.

  

It's the vocabulary that is going to effect interpretation - they aremysterious and vagueby design.

Their appeal is to the senses not to logical analysis.

  

Consider at theother end -today's Bob Dylan has admitted that he doesn't know himself what his songs 'mean', they don't have any! They have defied analysis, because there isn't meaning behind them.

They are simply chosen to conjure up emotions responses of certain *theme*.

  

Themes of universal appeal.

  

Anyway, I don't think grammarians are allowed to have emotions!

  

All these details are available from the academic sites of the major institutions in Oxford, Delhi...

  

Endless are the discussions...

  

...take what answer you like, and if you like any of them,make one up for yourselfand add it to the pile.

  

  

Seasons greetings, all.
