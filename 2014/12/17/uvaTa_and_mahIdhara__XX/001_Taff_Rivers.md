Valerio,

  

 Not a lot is known.

  

They were commentators of the Vedas, full stop!

  

  

 Wikipedia has this to say:

  

  

**Uvaṭa** was a commentator of the [Vedas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas"). He wrote commentaries of the [prātiśākhyas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratishakhya "Pratishakhya"), notably on the [Rigveda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda "Rigveda")-pratishakhya of [Shaunaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaunaka "Shaunaka"). According to [Bhimasena](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhimasena&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bhimasena (page does not exist)")'s *Sudhasagara-tika*, he was a brother of [Kaiyata](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaiyata&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kaiyata (page does not exist)"), the author of *Mahavhasyapradipa*, and of [Rajanka Mammata](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rajanka_Mammata&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rajanka Mammata (page does not exist)"), [\[1\]](http://www.koausa.org/Vitasta/12a.html) and lived at the court of [Bhoja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoja "Bhoja"), in the mid eleventh century.

**Mahīdhara** ("earth-bearing") was a 16th-century commentator of the [Vedas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas"). His treatises include the *Mantramahodadhi* (*[mantra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra "Mantra")-uda-dhí*, "great ocean of mantras") of ca. 1588, and the *Vedadipa* (*veda-dīpa*, "light of the Vedas"). The latter concerns the Vajasaneyi-samhita of the [White Yajurveda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Yajurveda "White Yajurveda").

Mahīdhara's namesake is a legendary mountain described in the *[Mahabharata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata "Mahabharata")*, which is also an [epithet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet "Epithet") of [Vishnu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu").
