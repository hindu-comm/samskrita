Is there any rule that to show respect for the person the verb form can be used in plural. Like one sentence is there in which king Jaisingh spoke to Hemchandraacharya-

  

"Evam vicharya sah *Jainmunimacharyam Hemchandram* praptavan , niveditavan cha, "ayi *acharyavaryah* ! bhavanto bhojavyakaransadrisham ekam vyakaranam *virachayantu ,* yen bhavatam mam cha amara keertibhavet" iti.

  

Another statement - Asya siddhantasya upadesha dwavinshatishatavarshebhya poorvam acharyen patanjalina swakeeye vyakaranmahabhashye kritah . Tatra *te* *kathayanti-*

*

I want to know why acharyavaryah and virachayantu forms are given in plural though above statement is spoken to only Hemchandra acharya.

  

Same in another statement " te kathayanti" is used for whom ? Why in plural?
