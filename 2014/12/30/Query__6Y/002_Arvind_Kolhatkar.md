Please write Sanskrit in Devanagari, if you can.

  

Writing Sanskrit in the Roman script, and that too without any diacritical marks, or in one of the accepted codings like Itrans, makes for painful, and at times, incorrect reading. If you want your simplistic doubts resolved from members here, the least that you should do is present them in a comprehensible manner!
