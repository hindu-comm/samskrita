Who is interested always in living  
  
in the forest of Kadamba trees  
which are similar  
to the wish giving Kalapaka trees and  
which is in the forest of Vilwa trees and  
which is situated in the gem island in the sea of nectar,  
  
  
The above is the translation taking आकल्प figuratively the adornment  
of कल्पद्रुम-s, i.e. equal or similar to. like आभरणस्याभरणं  
"आभरणस्याभरणं प्रसाधनविधेः प्रसाधनविशेषः । उपमानस्यापि सखे  
प्रत्युपमानं वपुस्तस्याः ॥ विक्रम० २ ।३॥ ३॥ of कालिदास. than the  
literal meaning, there is no कल्पद्रुम at all around the कादम्बवन, the  
dwelling place of श्यामला, nowhere at least in the Stotra. i.e.  
themselves, acting as आभरण, for the कल्पद्रुम-s which are superior to  
कल्पद्रुम-s by the dwelling of her. This is meaning full than your  
literal translation, for the reason I have already mentioned.
