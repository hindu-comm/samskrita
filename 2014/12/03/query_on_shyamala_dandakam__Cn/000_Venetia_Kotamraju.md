below is a line taken from the beginning of the popular shyamala dandaka. our understanding of the phrase 'kalpadruma-akalpa-kadamba' is 'kadamba (forests) with an adornment in the form of kalpadrumas', ie 'kadamba forests adorned with/decorated with kalpadrumas'. However, several other translators take it as 'kadamba (forests) in the shape of/similar to kalpadrumas'.

Can anyone help me with this? What is your interpretation?
