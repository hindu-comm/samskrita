The correct breaking the words individually is like above all the compounded parts could be identified.

  

The relationship based breaking parts meaningful way may differ.

  

I have given the possible syntactic relation according to the syntax and compound formation, without giving the explanation in Sanskrit, which would be declined according to the syntax of decomposition of the compound. The parts can suitably replaced in accordance with the Egnlish order for complete English sentence (supplying needed additions of prepositions to get English sentence).
