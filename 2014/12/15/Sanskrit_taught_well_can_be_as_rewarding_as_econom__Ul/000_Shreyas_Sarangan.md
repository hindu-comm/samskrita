## Sanskrit, taught well, can be as rewarding as economics

## <http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/men-and-ideas/sanskrit-taught-well-can-be-as-rewarding-as-economics/> 

Gurcharan Dasmakes a quite a few sensible points here. Could member please share their thoughts on this:

"This is the answer to the bright young person who asks, ‘Why should I invest in learning a difficult language like Sanskrit when I could enhance my life chances by studying economics or commerce?’ Sanskrit can, in fact, boost one’s life chances. A rigorous training in Panini’s grammar rules can reward us with the ability to formulate and express ideas that are uncommon in our languages of everyday life...."
