These words having the meaning of mother (अम्बा) are declined like रमा and other feminine words in आ suffix. These take only ए in सम्बुद्धि.

  

सम्बुद्धौ च ७।३।१०६\|

In the above quoted rule you might have noticed नदी also, included in the rule "अम्बार्थ-नद्योर्ह्रस्वः। where the word नदी does not take only the word नदी, but all the word in feminine gender, ending with ई and ऊ suffixes called as नदी. In the above case, the word श्री is not ending with feminine form with the suffix ई, as the word itself ends with ई, श्री, without any suffix. That is the difference. And in declension also it takes a different set of rules. than नदी.

I have not given the complete derivational process for saving time.
