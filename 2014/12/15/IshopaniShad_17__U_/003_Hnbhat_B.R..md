This is Sanskrit and and this is the style of Sanskrit. Even without is or would be, or was, the auxiliary verb, it is a possitive statement. I don't know the usage of the Italian expression in its Italian context. Though idea is the same, the context is different.

  

The idea is in the context is this. This body is impermenant. The body perishes into ashes. The same idea. It can be referring to future, or past. The context differ, whether the body is referred by इदम्, which refers directly to the body (live or dead as you can imagine). So considering the dissolvement process, this refers to living human body, from which body would dissolve, first vital breath into the immortal air, and the mortal body would reduce into airshes.

  



The translation follows, taking the auxiliary verb, in the benedective mood:

like Sri Shankaracharya, who takes it as the final mood of the dying person, as his prayer (upasana) to attain with the Supreme Soul. And the next verse asks his mind, to recall what has been done good or bad deeds.

  

This is part of Sri Shankara's commentary. who supplies भूयात् instead of present tense. Both are possible. There is nothing wrong. If you substitute the auxilliary verb in present tense अभवत्, it would mean the same. My body ended with ashes. Or भवति, my body ends into ashes (fire). If you do not consider it a general statement, it need not be related with "my byody", it any furutre or present or past, auxilliary verb would fit the context.

  

This may differ according to one's interpretation of the idea. The next prays Agni, to lead in good path. He is prayed in the next, to consider the good or bad deed whatever he has said.
