Aryabhata I had given the following value of 'pi' in Aryabhatiya.

  

व्यासे भनन्दाग्निहते विभक्ते

खबाणसूर्यै: परिधिः सुसूक्ष्मः।

द्वाविंशतिघ्ने विहृतेऽथ शैलै:

स्थूलोऽथवा स्याद्व्यवहारयोग्य:॥

  

Diameter multiplied byभ (27), नन्द (9) अग्नि (3) i.e. by 3927 and divided by ख (0), बाण (5), सूर्य (12) i.e. by 1250 yields the relatively exact value of the circumference. (In other words, if the diameter is taken equal 1 unit of length, the circumference will be 3927/1250 units of length.) Diameter multiplied by 22 and divided by 7 (there are 7 शैलs or कुलपर्वतs), the result is a broad one, suitable for day-to-day use.

  

Hindu mathematicians generally regarded 'pi' in broad measure to be equal to the square-root of 10.

  

The Kerala mathematicians of the 13-14 centuries had further refined to value of 'pi' by use of the technique of summation of infinite series.
A British official, Charles M.Whish, who was interested in the Kerala Mathematics had published a paper on this in a meeting of the Madras Literary Society on December 15, 1832. Internet has a lot of info on Whish, his paper and the Kerala school of Mathematics.

  

Incidentally, the nomenclature 'pi' to denote the transcendental number representing the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle was first used by in 1706 by William Jones, a British Mathematician, who was the father of the orientalist Wilson Jones of Calcutta.
