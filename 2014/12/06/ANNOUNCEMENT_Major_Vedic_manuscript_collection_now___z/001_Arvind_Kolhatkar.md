Good work indeed! Congratulations.

  

On a family visit to Gokarna-Mahabaleshwar about 20 years ago, I had occasion to stay in the Joglekar household for a couple of days. I did not know at that time that the Joglekar family had such a rich tradition of Vedic learning. I do remember the beautiful shore-line of Gokarna, an interplay between green hills and the sea.

  

Incidentally, is the second name 'Koglekar' or 'Kodlekere' as shown in the website? 'Koglekar' is an unlikely Marathi surname. 'Joglekar,' on the other hand, is a common Chitpawan surname from Maharashtra. (My own mother's maiden surname was 'Joglekar'.) There is a well-known substratum of Chitpawan families which migrated from Konkan to the coastal areas south of Mangalore, all the way to Kerala, in pursuit of the vocation as priests or as traders in coconuts and other coastal produce.
