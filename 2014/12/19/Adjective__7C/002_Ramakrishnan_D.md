Now a days, there is no rule or rhyme for the people to follow.  They use their own will to be a rule for themselves.

You may, if you want to adopt samskritsed word, name the boy 'kajolaH', and the girl as 'Kajolaa". (kajolasya bhraataa & kajolaayaaH bhraataa as the case may be).

Will it be right, Bhatt Mahoday !
