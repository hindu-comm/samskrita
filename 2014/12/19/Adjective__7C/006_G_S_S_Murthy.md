In this context may I say the following: There is a need to standardize how we decline in Sanskrit words originating in other languages. For example should "Gandhi" or "Modi" be declined as इकारान्त or नकारान्त? मोदिः-मॊदी-मोदयः ; मोदी-मोदिनौ-मोदिनः \] Some avoid this confusion by adding "वर्यः"/"महोदयः". Should it be कापिः or कापी for "Coffee"? I believe there is an organization to standardize French words although there is no such organization for English. As Sanskrit needs to absorb and translate large number of words from other modern languages for it to become a living language, it is necessary to have an organization dedicated to standardizing such words. May be this forum could discuss this matter in some depth.

Regards

Murthy
