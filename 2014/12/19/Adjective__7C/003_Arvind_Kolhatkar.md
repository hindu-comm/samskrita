This happens in Russian all the time. The Sanskrit word राम is transliterated in the day-to-day Roman script as Rama, as there is no way of separately showing अ from आ at the end of the word. In Russian this gets transliterated as Рама. Now the Russian language, unlike the English language and like Sanskrit, conjugates a noun to show the विभक्ति and the endings depend upon the last consonant or vowel, exactly as in Sanskrit. In Russian, most nouns ending in 'a' are feminine and most masculine nouns end in consonants and both genders have their own conjugations.

  

Rama (Рама in Russian) has a vowel-end and is thus conjugated like any other feminine noun, though the word is obviously masculine.
