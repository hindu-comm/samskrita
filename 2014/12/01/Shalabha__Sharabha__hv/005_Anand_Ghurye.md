Dear Dr. Bhat ,  
  
Thank you very much for your help . I was looking for the nirukta because I saw that the most popular meaning of Sharabha was Locust or Grass Hopper . Where as a someone I met with the name Sharabha told me that it was the name of Shiva . So I was wondering how Shiva is connected to locusts .  
  

When he is called as Sharabheshwar , the entire meaning changes and makes sense .  

  

Thanks once again .  
  
  
  

  

  
  
  
Regards ,  
  
Anand Ghúryé
