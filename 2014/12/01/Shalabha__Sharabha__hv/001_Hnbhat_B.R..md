The above are names Śarabha is used. How much you can find derivation  
equally applicable to the above names denoting different persons?  
  
The below is the persons names  
  
  
\[L=5991\] \[p= 672,2\] ŚALABHA I. An asura, son of Kaśyapaprajāpati by

\[L=5992\] ŚALABHA II. A warrior, who fought against the  
Kauravas on the Pāṇḍava side. He was killed by  
Karṇa. (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 49).  
But none denote it Shiva. But it is applied to Vishnu in his Sahasranama---  
  
It is an epithet of Veerabhadra, as शरभेश्वर  
  
Here is a book on Sharabheshvara form of Shiva.  
  
I don't think there is nothing going to add to epithets by etymology.  
It depends on the form ascribed to the deities in Tantra, Purana etc.  
  
Here it is seen as a mixed form of a bird and an animal (like lion),  
an avatara took up for punishing Narasimhavatara, by either Shiva or  
Veerabhadra, both are worshiped in Tantric prayoga-s. An image is
