यदि एषा चर्चा संकृतभाषया भवति तर्हि चर्चायाः आवश्यकता एव न स्यात्!

yadi ēṣā carcā saṁkr̥tabhāṣayā bhavati tarhi carcāyāḥ āvaśyakatā ēva na syāt!

*"In Internet age, Why buy Sanskrit books when you can learn using on line resources?*

*Sanskrit is taught in a complex script allover in Indian schools and colleges but how many Sanskrit graduates are fluent in Sanskrit? Will these graduates be able to find jobs as priests or teachers? Look at most Indian Gurus who chant in Sanskrit but communicate in English Why?
  
Most of Sanskrit knowledge have already been translated and available in various languages.*

*While this comment does not warrant discussion, I succumb -  
*

  

1. Why cook at home? There are restaurants. Or, processed food ready to go. Or even a pill that can stave off hunger. Come to it, why live at all!

2. why go to space? There are comets and planets already there! (If this sounds silly, the comment above is even sillier!)  

3. Why make a new movie? There are thousands of movies already existing that we just need to recycle.

  

One of limited perception believes the entire world as perceived.

  

Samskritam was originally not a written language. So, no script is needed. But, the oral tradition retained the integrity of the language. Anybody who wants to do away with script, if able to retain language integrity, is welcome to do so, I am sure.

Why devanAgarI script? Written representation that is faithful to the uttered word - if one is able to resist the temptation to pronounce 'b' as 'bee' and see it as 'b', the pronunciation for the alpaprANa-oShThavya-mRduvyanjanam, then one may surely do so.
Samskritam is written in several regional scripts. In most cases the pronunciation in the regional language for that script representation is the same as it is in Samskritam.

  

*"... but communicate in English Why"*  

It looks like the non-English communication is invisible / inaudible to the person who is asking the question!  

  

"It is computation Sanskrit age and why people are learning grammar inschools instead of teaching Computational Sanskrit?"  

Who are the people that were able to come up with the concept of Computational Sanskrit? Those ignorant of Sanskrit as a language? To illustrate this point - What is better? Being a consumer of animated cartoons? Or, the creators of it?

  

"It is not easy to change the system deep rooted for ages. That is the answer."  

किमर्थं परिवर्तनम्? If people know to 'fish', why make them unlearn it or forget it, and then, for survival make them dependent on others?  

  

"*Will these graduates be able to find jobs as priests or teachers?*"

Being a priest or a teacher is a privilege indeed! But, these are not the only professions that asaṁskr̥tajñaḥ can pursue. The **whole wide world** is open as a career - if only we are**creative enough**,**courageous enough, and anugr̥hītāḥ(fortunate enough)**to see it.
