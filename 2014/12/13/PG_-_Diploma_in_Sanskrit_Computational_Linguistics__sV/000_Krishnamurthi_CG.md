Friends, follow the link for one year course on Sanskrit Computational Linguistics. Eligibility: M.A. Sanskrit any decipline. In this course one can learn in depth on portions of Vyakarana, Maths & Statistics (including portions from Chandas Shastra), NLP-Linguistics and Computer Programming. A good course for Sanskrit students to learn contemporary tools and technologies and also some of our shastras in-depth.
