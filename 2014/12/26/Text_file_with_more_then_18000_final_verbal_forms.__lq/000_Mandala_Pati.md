Hare Kṛṣṇa!  
  
I compiled for myself file with final verbal forms. It can be useful for You. Dhātu list is taken form dhātu-pāṭha of Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī's Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa.  
2nd file is similar, but for namas.  
3rd one for avyayas  
4th one - it's my attemp to make index for dhātu-ratnākara.
