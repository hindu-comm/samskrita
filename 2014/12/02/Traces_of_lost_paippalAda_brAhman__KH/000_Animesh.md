Srī mātre namaH

Namaste

By grace of parAmba and my gurU ,I was able to trace some information on lost brAhman portion of paippalAda samhitA.  
While my self study of bramha sutra ( 3.3.25 ) I had found some evidencces of this PB in SrI shankarAcharya's bhAshya. After that I was able to collect some more information. My following post concerns with lost paippalAda brahman .  
I request all group members to visit it.  
( At the same incidence I have realized why we call SrI shankarAcharya as " shuti smriti purAnAnAM AlayaM karunAlayaM ........ )
