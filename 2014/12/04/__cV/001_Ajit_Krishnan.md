For what it's worth -- many of the documents on this site are stolen from other sites on the web (stolen = copy-paste, remove attribution, and claim it was independently typeset). In addition, the site tries to make it difficult for anyone else to copy-paste the actual text that they themselves have copied. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

  

Personally, I prefer patronizing [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) especially for documents that are available in both places.
