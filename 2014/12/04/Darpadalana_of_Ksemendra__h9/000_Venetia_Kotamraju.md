Namaste,

I recently typed up the text of Ksemendra's Darpadalana, a satire on pride (darpa), for a project we are currently working on. The text is taken from the Kavya Mala series. I am attaching the Word document and PDF of the text. Anyone who wishes to read or use it is more than welcome. It is all in Unicode. 

If you notice any typos or mistakes please do let me know. At some point we will put this up online for all to read and download.

Best,

Venetia
