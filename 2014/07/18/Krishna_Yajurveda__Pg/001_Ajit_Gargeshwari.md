You will find Pada Patha of Krishna Yajurveda in DLI and archives. I doubt nay body has will publish Krama jata Ghanha and further pathas which are meant for reciters of the vedic texts in their shakas. Checking with Google DLI and archives would be a good idea before asking for PDFs

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
