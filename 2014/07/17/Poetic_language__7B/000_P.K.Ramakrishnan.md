Poetic language in Sanskrit is classified into three groups -

drakshaa paakam, kadaliipakam and naalikerapaakam.

  

Draaksha or grape does not have a cover - it can be eaten as it is.

  

Kadali refers to plantain fruit which has one cover after removing which

it can be eaten.

  

Naalikera frefers to the coconut fruit. It has many covers.

The first one is the thick outer cover. After removing this one has the

hard shell. Then after cutting this only one reaches the eatable portion.

  

Kalidasa poetry comes in the first category.

  

Maagha comes in the second categoy.

  

Naishadha comes in the third categoy.

  

Probably members can mention other examples.
