Dear All,



The Serenity Prayer, authored by Reinhold Niebuhr, as some of you might know, runs as follows:



God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

The courage to change the things I can,

And wisdom to know the difference.



Does anyone know any shloka in Samskrita that has the same message delivered?



Warm Regards

Sanjay
