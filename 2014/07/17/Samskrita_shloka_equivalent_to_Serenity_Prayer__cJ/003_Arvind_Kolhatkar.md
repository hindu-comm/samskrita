I do not know for sure whether such a shloka does or does not exist and would be happy to know if one does exist.

  

However, going along the traditional way of Indian thought, it looks unlikely to me that anybody could have expressed such 'rebellious' thoughts. In India, one was taught to accept things as they were, have faith in the guidance from higher authorities, starting from the Scriptures down to one's own Guru. The tendency to question and to want to change was generally not tolerated, much less encouraged.
