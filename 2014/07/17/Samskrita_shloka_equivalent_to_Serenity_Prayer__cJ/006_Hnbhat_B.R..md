This idea has come down to day through phrases like "fiddle while Rome burns" in English only with the difference, from the Indian Version:

Fig. to do nothing or something trivial while knowing that something disastrous is happening. (From a legend that the Roman emperor Nero played the lyre while Rome was burning.) The lobbyists don't seem to be doing anything to stop this tax bill. They're fiddling while Rome burns.

  

The city of Mithila is replaced by Rome.! The above is used as idiom in English language. The idea could spring up simultaneously in different languages. One is Indian version of the idiom given by Sanjaya.

  

Thanks for the idea.
