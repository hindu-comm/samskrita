Robert Oppenheimer - Famous Quotes:

  

"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one." and "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." Robert Oppenheimer after the first test of the atomic bomb.

  

This is a quotation from Bhagavdgita - Chapter 11 Sloka12  

Viswarupa darsana

  

divi suryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitaa /

yadi bhaah sadrusii saa syaat bhaasastasya mahaatmanah //

  

He was not satisfied to know this from the translation. So he

learnt Sanskrit to know the words first hand.
