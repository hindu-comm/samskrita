Hi Sri Ravi

  

You can get Shanthi Ratnakara Uttara bhaga from DLI site. This is in Grantha Script. Poorva bhaga of Shanti Ratnakara is not available in internet. But you can get xerox copy of poorva and uttara bhaga of Shanti Kusumakaram and Shanti Ratnakara from KSRI Mylapore.

  

Alternate option you can get shanti kusumakaram in devenagari lipi published by Sri Swarnapuri Publications. the list of books are here "<http://swarnapuri.in/WebBkListTamil.pdf>"

  

Thanks

C.R.Bala
