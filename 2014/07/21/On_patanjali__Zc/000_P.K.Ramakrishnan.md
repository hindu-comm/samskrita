There is a story of how Patanjali

became the Bhashyakara of Paninisutras.

  

Patanjali was an incarnation of Adisesha

the serpent. After writing the Sutras

Panini was performing the sandhyavandanam

in a river ghat. When he took some water in his

palm he found a serpent. Then he asked the serpent -

korbhavaan. (Instead of ko bhavaan).= who are you.

The serpent replied - sapoham. (Instead of sarpoham). (I am sapa)

Panini - rephah kutah. (where is r ).

Patanjali - tvayaa apahritah (taken away by you).

  

Panini thought the Patanjali was the best person to write

the commentary (bhashyam) for his sutras.(ashtaadhyaayi).

  

How he got the name patanjali - he fell in the anjali of Panini.

anjalaow patanaat - patanjalih
