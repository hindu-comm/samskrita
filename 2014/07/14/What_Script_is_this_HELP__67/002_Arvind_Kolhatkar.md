This looks clearly Devanagari. The first three lines seem to be

  

श्रीगणे

शाय नम:

संवत् ??

  

The Samvat year after this is not clear but could be 1864 because it also seems to be repeated at the very end of the inscription. 

  

Some individual Devanagari letters after the Samvat year number can be identified but I could not read any meaningful word out of the them.

  

The last five lines and two letters preceding them could be in the Arabic or Persian scripts.

  

Samvat 1864 corresponds to CE 1807-08.
