Its in Devanagari thats the script. What it means needs to be answered by an epigraphist. Which Hindu temple is it from. Every other ancient Hindu temple will have stone engraved epigraphs denoting grants made, epic story, and other details. I donot think seing aphoto like this any one will be able to make any sense from it
