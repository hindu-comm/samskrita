dear janakisharan ji, namaste.

i am though not authorised to write anything about your good questions .. yet tempted to write as below. hope that leaders of the group will pardon me.

Gayatri is goddess.. agreed. the form of the goddess is alphabetical divided in three padas.. gayatri is also a meter ( chaanda) of 24 words traditionally . if some one undersatand the matrika varnas by their colour, place, guna and karma, devataa and aayudha etc, and later unite them togather and then analyse them -- may come close to understand the gAyatri.

the form of gAyatri in the body is also considerable. ( yat piNDe tat brahmANDe) 14 lokas = sapta pAtAla = from nAbhi to toe. sapta Urdhvaloka = from nAbhi to throat. some pictures show upto brahmaranshra but i do not agree because the 3 gunas are ending at throat. upper part to throat is chidAkAsh.

regards,

kamalesh pathak
