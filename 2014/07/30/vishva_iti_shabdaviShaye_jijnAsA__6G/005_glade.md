Dear Scholars ,

  

If I am understand question , it ask about meaning of sanskrit word "vishwa"

  

Following post does not provide it and tries to provide blur meaning and grammar explanation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Few questions :

  

1\) Where we are living currently ? Is it Bhu-loka or else ?

2\) Our earth is in "vishwa" or out of "vishwa" ?

3\) What "loka" word means and what "puri" word means ( bhu-loka, Brahma-puri, Vaikuntha etc )

4\) What Bhagwat Puran , Devi Bhagwat, Gayatri shloka , Vishnu Puran , MahaBharata says about lokas and Patals ?

5\) What purans and Upanishad says about "Jagat" word .

6\) If Brahma destroy tri-loka on end of his one day what are those tri-loka ?

7\) When Brahma completes his age of 100years and got died then what happen to "satya-loka" and "Brahma-puri" ?  

8\) If Shakti have created 3 ishvara ( Brahma-Vishnu- Shiva) then where Shakti living ?

9\) Who is Narayana and where Krishna came from ?

  

Please go through above questions and ask yourself if "lokas" and "Patala" are not true then what is truth ? Where we are living ?

Why all Purans , Upanishads , Mahabharat says same things ? Is it myth or have actual cosmological details ?

  

Answer of above question will be more helpful to understand actual meaning of word "Vishwa" .

  

This thread will be long but I hope it will benefits us all.

  

Thanks,

Gaurang
