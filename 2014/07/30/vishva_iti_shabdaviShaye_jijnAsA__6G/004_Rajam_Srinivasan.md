Thank you very much. this is really fascinating. 

  

In Gayathri mantra --only three lokas -- Bhuh, Bhuvaha, and Swahaha are used and they are designated as "vyaahruthis". Can all the 14 lokas be considered as vyaahruthis? I have heard one of the students (in a Samskrit class) add 4 more lokas -- Mahah, Janah, Tapah and Satya also.
Is there some significance using only 3 lokas as vyaahruthis or using 7 lokas (do they also become vyaahruthis?) at the beginning of the Gayathri mantra? I am not sure what exactly are these "vyaahruthis?"
Can Gayathri be chanted without first mentioning of these vyaahruthis at the beginning? 

  

I remember that another name for the Lady Goddess Gayathri is also "tri-paada-aksharey"-- the One Who adorns and is adorned (and adored) by the aksharas (syllables -- 24 to be exact) which are organized in three paadaas (lines, portions or legs/ supporting-pedestrals). But adding these vyaahruthis make the syllable-count more than 24! I also vaguely remember that one of our epics (probably Ramayana) has 24 chapters because of the 24 syllable-count of Gayathri mantra. 

  

Any clarification about these points will be greatly appreciated.

  

I sincerely apologize if these questions of mine are rather trivial for the caliber of scholars in this forum. Sorry:(( 

  

I wonder if you could list the names of the 14 lower lokas also. Thank you most kindly.

  

Warm regards,
