Hi janaki,

Writing in English but will provide exact meaning on word "vishwa".

Jagat word is stand for trilok which includes swarga,bhuloka,patala.

Vidhwa WOR stand for or lokas :

There 14 super lokas : bhulok, bhuvar loka, yum loka, pitru loka, swar loka, mahar loka, Jana loka , tapa loka, satya loka, Brahma loka, Vishnu loka, shiv loka, shakti loka, go- loka.

7 patala

This 14 upper loka and 7 patala combine is called " vishwa".

  
I hope this makes very clear understanding.

The  
Gaurang
