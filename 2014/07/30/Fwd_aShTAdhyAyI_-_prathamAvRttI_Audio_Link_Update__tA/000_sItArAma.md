Namaste All,

Sorry of the confusion with my previous mail, I made a mistake while uploading the MP3 files to [archive.org](http://archive.org).I contacted their support team andthey corrected the website link.Now the URL makes much more sense and easy to understand.



To access PrathamaaVrutti recordings please go to below webpage.

<https://archive.org/details/PrathamaaVrutti>



I willnot sende-mail updates after each class as I used to do for other classes. I will try to post the audio right after the class or next day to above given website. I urge you to bookmark this page and visit regularly to get the latest recording.

You can download a personal copy for yourself. The audio is available under creative common license and must not be used for any monetary gains without written permission from author "Acharya Vedshrami" he can be reached at [acharyav...@gmail.com]()



Let me know if you have any questions

-Anant
