Here is a book in Marathi, called Durgatrishati, I got on searching. It goes in Marathi, but no Sanskrit text.

Though there are Lalitatrishati, and other trishati's, I could not find this one in sanskrit archives:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_unic/>

  

Lalitha trishati is available everywhere.

  

Only Durga Saptashati is popularly known which is called Devimahatmya portion of Markandeya Purana, which is the content of the above Marathi book. and named as Durga Trishati, after the first chapter as I could view the sample pages in the above link.
