CHANDRAKANT

Landmark Novel on Vedanta

By Iccharam Suryaram Desai

Hindi translation

Set of 3 books

2006 22 x 14 cm 1600 pages

Hardcover Rs. 1800 for the set

  

This work is a watershed in Indian spiritual literature. Written originally in Gujarati, it brought many readers into the fold of advaitavada, or Shankara's Vedic monism. The present work is an excellent Hindi translation of the original.

  

Ancient Hindu literature consisting of the Vedas and Vedangas, the 18 Puranas and Smritis is available today. But its readership has dwindled. \[kalo jagadbhakshakah\]

  

It is more important than ever before to read these scriptures. But the vicissitudes of modern lifestyles do not allow the common man the time and motivation to read these exhaustive texts.

  

Bearing this in mind, the author Iccharam Suryaram Desai wrote his magnum opus with the key intention of promoting the concept of "adhyatmavidya vidyanam" {only knowledge of the self is true knowledge}. In this magnificent work he established the importance of moksha as the only cure for the unceasing cycle of transmigration. Desai wrote that Vedanta was the royal path to liberation, moksha, and clarified the Vedanta way. He explained the most complicated questions of Vedanta using examples from the Hindu scriptures and from daily life. Hence the book is a veritable storehouse of knowledge of the supreme self.

  

Normally, Vedanta is seen as being very dry, difficult to grasp and impossible to apply in our day to day lives. However, Desai's pen makes Vedanta appear interesting, rational, logical and easy to follow. The author's skill lies in making the reader feel at one with the ancient masters of Vedanta. During the course of reading this great work, this reviewer was immersed in the world of the Vedas and Vedangas, the Upanishads and Puranas.

  

The Book is structured as under:

  

CHANDRAKANT Volume 1

Pratham Pravaha: Purushartha \[in question answer format\]

Dvitiya Pravaha: Caitanya \[hagiography of King Yajnabhu used to illustrate the cardinal principles of Vedanta\]

  

CHANDRAKANT Volume 2

Tritiya Pravaha: Acyuta Padarohana \[hagiographies of Batuka and King Varepsu used to throw light on the steps a mumukshu", seeker of liberation, ought to take to attain moksha\]

  

CHANDRAKANT Volume 3

Caturtha Pravaha: Himagiri ki Parnakuti \[the true Sati, the duties of man, the duties of a true guru and the ultimate message of Vedanta are explained here\]
