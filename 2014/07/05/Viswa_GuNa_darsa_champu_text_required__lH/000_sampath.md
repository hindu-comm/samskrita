I request learned members' help in getting the text "Viswa GuNa darsa champu" by Sri Venkatadhwari. Another work Lakshmi sahasram is available in [archive.org](http://archive.org). The work is about two gandharvas flying over the 108 divya desams, one commenting on the merits of the divyadesam, and the other its deficiencies and demerits.  

  

It is said that he lost his eyesight after composing the champu. He believed that the loss was due to the apacharam to bhagavathas, and he composed Lakshmi Sahasram as expiation and regained his sight.

  

Thanking you all in advance,

  

Sampath
