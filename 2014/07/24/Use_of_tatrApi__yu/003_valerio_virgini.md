Dear dr. Bhat  

  

My intention is not dispute the translation that comes from the parampara. That is surely right.  
  
Being inexperienced in Sanskrit, I do not know if the gradual expressed by the poet, is grammatically identifiable; without doubt?  
  

Or, if from a point of view only the grammatical, doubt may exist,  
and understanding of gradualism is due to the deep understanding of the poetic dimension.?  
  
  
I agree with you that you do not appreciate poetry with grammar and dictionary, but grammar and dictionary should be the base.  
  

thanks  

valerio
