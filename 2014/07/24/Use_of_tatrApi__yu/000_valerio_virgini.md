Dear members,  

in Upadeśāmṛta of Rūpa Gosvāmī there is a verse with the use of adverbs
तत्रापि.  
  
  
वैकुण्ठाज्जनितो वरा मधुपुरी तत्रापि रासोत्सवाद्  
वृन्दारण्यमुदारपाणिरमणात्तत्रापि गोवर्धनः ।  
राधाकुन्डमिहापि गोकुलापतेः प्रेमामृताप्लावनात्  
कुर्यादस्य विराजतो गिरितटे सेवां विवेकी न् कः ॥९॥  
  
The translation is the following:  
  
  
Because Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared there, Mathurā is considered to  
be spiritually superior to Vaikuṇṭha. Greater than Mathurā  
is the forest of Vṛndāvana because this was where the  
rāsa-līlā pastimes of the Lord took place. Govardhana Hill  
is considered to be superior to Vṛndāvana becauseKṛṣṇa  
performed wonderful pastimes there and raised it with His  
hand. However, Rādhā-kuṇḍa is superior to Govardhana  
because it is brimming with the nectar of divine love for  
the Lord of Gokula. Which intelligent person will not  
render service to this place which is situated at the foot of  
Govardhana?  
  
I do not understand the function of these adverbs.  
  
  
I would have translated "even in that place," believing Vṛmdāvana, Govardhana and Radhakunda the same level.  
  
Can someone enlighten me?  

Thanks  

Valerio
