I don't have any objection if you beilieve so. But I believe it is the same position in this verse:

  

काव्येषु नाटकं रम्यं तत्र रम्या शकुन्तला।

तत्रापि च चतुर्थोऽङ्कस्तत्र श्लोकचतुष्टयम्।।  

  

You can simply classify all the four gradually mentioned in the first class Kavya is beautiful. If you use simple commonsense, there is no need of mentioning each separately, as it does not worth mentioning individually. And it simply means the things mentioned, worth mentioning among the grades below and itself separates from the one below and so on. Either it has to be writing nonsense, without anything, to repeat the components, separately. That is how to understand the poetry to understand the intention of the poet and not just the dictonary meaning which will lead you nowhere.
