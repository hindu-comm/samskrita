The requirement for understanding the poetry is given by the great connossiur of poetry, who extended the maxim "ध्वनिः शब्दः" a grammatical concept to pervade whole of poetry into a great sentence:

  

काव्यस्यात्मा स एवार्थस्तथा चादिकवेः पुरा ।  

क्रौञ्च-द्वन्द्व-वियोगोत्थः शोकः श्लोकत्वमागतः । । ध्व्क्\_१.५ । ।  

  

शब्दार्थ-शासन-ज्ञान-मात्रेणैव न वेद्यते ।

वेद्यते स तु काव्यार्थ-तत्त्वज्ञैरेव केवलम् । । ध्व्क्\_१.७ ।  

  

Your concept of doubt, guess etc. also find place in poetry as figures of speech:

  

सन्देहालंकारः (doubt), विभावनालंकारः (guess) and not only what is beyond doubt by other standards. Attesting with reasoning also find place, as काव्यार्थापत्ति, which is in other cases, becomes a means of attestation of a given fact. अर्थापत्तिप्रमाण.

  

This is just a guide line to the differenciation of poetical language plus poetic convention. And there is nothing against grammar, but only it lies beyond what words can convey by lexicons and grammar. This the plain reply to your doubts expressed recently. I have given another example of the same structure, which distinguishes the drama Shakuntala, from other plays, and the particular four verses. The identification of the four verses, is attempted in this thread, but not beyond doubt (according to you):
