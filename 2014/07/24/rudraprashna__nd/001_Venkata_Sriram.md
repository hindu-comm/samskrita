Namaste,



Some critical analysis was done by Pandit Sripad Damodar Sattvalekar in his 40th volume of "vaidika vyAkhyAna mAla" which was published by "swAdhyAya maNDal, pAraDi, sUrat". One of the articles in this volume is "rudra devata swarupa".



The e-book is available online in Archive.Org. One need to type the name "damodar sattvalekar" in the search option.



Thought of not replyingtothis post since you mentioned the term "time of composition of rudraprashna" which violates the concept of apaursheyatva of veda. But then, thought why not share this book which could be useful for "your pursuit".



regs,

PVS
