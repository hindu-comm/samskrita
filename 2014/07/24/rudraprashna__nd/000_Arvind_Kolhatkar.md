Dear Group,

  

I would like to poll scholars in this Group as to whether they have come across any study paper based on its internal evidence about 1) the socio-economic condition of India at the time of the composition of रुद्रप्रश्न in यजुर्वेद and 2) the evolution of शिव, a largely benevolent deity from the fierce and warlike रुद्र, as seen in रुद्रप्रश्न. If anyone has come across any such study, I shall appreciate a digital link to it.

  

I have seen three traditional commentaries on रुद्रप्रश्न - those by सायणाचार्य, भट्टभास्कर and one in Marathi by श्रीपादशास्त्री किंजवडेकर.
All these explain the Metaphysics of रुद्रप्रश्न but not the secular aspects thereof as above.
