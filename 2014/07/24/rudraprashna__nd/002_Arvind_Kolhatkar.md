Thank you for your indulgence in helping an apostate like me who does not believe in theअपौरुषेय nature of the Vedas.

  

In the same spirit let me enlighten you that the correct query to enter in the search box is not 'damodar sattvalekar' as you give it with a double t, but 'Shripad Damodar Satavalekar'. A biographical note on him may be seen atभारतीय अर्वाचीन चरित्रकोष भाग २ by Siddheshwarashastri Chitrav..
