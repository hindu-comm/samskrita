Thanks for the explanation.

  

How to decide whether पठति belongs to तुदादि or भ्वादि?

  

What about चर्चति which is classified under तुदादि? There is also गुण like पठ in the धातु.

  

चल =चल् अ भृतौ 10 चुरादि 62

  

having अ in the धातु, is classified in चुरादिः and also in तुदादिः।

  

चल चल् अ विलसने 6 तुदादि 63



in both there is अ according to you and classified in भ्वादि and not in तुदादि.

  

व्यच व्यच् अ व्याजीकरणे 6  

  

Here also there is अ in the धातु. but classified in तुदादिः.
