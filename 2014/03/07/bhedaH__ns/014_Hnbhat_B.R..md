Thanks for your suggestion. 

  

Please go on Vedic Grammar. For me, धातुपाठ is enough if one learns basic texts and basic verbs of each गण. So many have listed the verbs in धातुपाठ-s in different forms, some like Amarakosha, and some with GaNa-s and some like listed by the endings, with different meaning in Gana-s of he same roots.

  

For गुण is prescribed by specific rules, to इ, उ, ऋ, लृ letters and in सार्वधातुक or आर्धधातुक suffixes. or लघूपध vowels of these letters, i.e. penultimate letters. By these, गुण is prescribed to those cases in भ्वादि and there is no need to get any गुण according to these rules for पठ or any other vowel, ए, ओ etc. These do not get any गुण. And it is not the standard to recognize whether one root belong to तुदादि or भ्वादि, but looking at the धातु lists in the alphabetical order or in Ganapatha order, if one wants to use the verb.

  

Only the verbs having these vowels take गुण in the भ्वादि before शप् and the do not take गुण in तुदादि for which श is the replaced विकरण for the verbs. Therefore, while नी+अ, भू+अ takes गुण and becomes नयति, भवति, विश्+अ, तुद्+अ does not take गुण, because "सार्वधातुकमपित्" though it is सार्वधातुक, it is considered as ङित् and गुण is prohibited. and we get the forms विशति, तुदति etc. Only in such cases the difference can be understood by the forms. The accents are govern whether the verb takes आत्मनेपद, परस्मैपद or both suffixes and do not differenciate the धातु-s by गण-s, but only by the विकरण-s prescribed by Panini. This is what I have understood from my study of grammar.
