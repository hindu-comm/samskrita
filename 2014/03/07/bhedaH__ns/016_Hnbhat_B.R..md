Thank you for the clarification.

  

This will certainly help in classifying the verb into bhvAdi or otherwise. In the visible final forms, they are not written with Svara-s to idenfy the Gana-s. There is no other way where there is no शप्. i.e. सार्वधातुक, पठित्वा, पठति or भूत्वा, भवति.Even for चुरादि, धातु-s, शप् is added and तिप् is also added.

  

Easiest way to identify to which the धातु belongs to is just look into the alphabetical list, where they are listed with accents or without accents, as per the गण-s. I had given the links to धातुपाठ page, where it can be searched on the page itself, listed in the alphabetical order with Gana-s noted.

  

Thanks for the information once again for the reason for classifying. Anyhow here is the link to the सूत्र in काशिका.

Hope this may be helpful to find out the svara-s of धातु by Vedic accent.
