Other than the written -visible guNa, the tudAdi vikaraNa sha is presumably udAtta, in contrast with the bhvAdi vikaraNa shap, which would be anudAtta, by "anudAttau suppitau".

Word-internal guNa vowel changes usually happen only if the vowel is udAtta. In bhvAdi, the root syllable remains udAtta by default if the termination is 'p'it (e.g., ti'p'), and the vikaraNa is also tip - shap - thus bhavati. In tudati, because the vikaraNa sha is udAtta, the syllable in the root becomes anudAtta due to "anudAttam padam ekavarjam" (then svarita, just for ease of pronunciation).
