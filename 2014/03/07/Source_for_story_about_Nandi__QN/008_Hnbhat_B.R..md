It seems that Nirmalananda, has taken the noun as a proper noun literally, unlike Sayana who took it metaphoric allusion to the face of Nandi.

  

चक्रं तुण्डे यस्य सः - चक्रतुण्डः ० one who has the disc in his mouth.

Like चक्रपाणिः. which is the specific disc of Vishnu regularly characterised by the disc, and used as his epithet and is listed in शब्दकल्पद्रुम:

  

*cakrapāṇiḥ, puṁ, (cakraṁ sudarśanāstraṁ pāṇau yasya .  
*

*vyadhikaraṇabahubrīhisamāsaḥ .)* viṣṇuḥ

  

or चरणायुधः = epithet for used as synonym cock.

caraṇāyudhaḥ, puṁ, (caraṇa evāyudhaṁ astraviśeṣo

yasya .) kukkuṭaḥ . ityamaraḥ . 2 . 5 . 17

  

which is popular that the cocks fight each other using their claws as the weapon and there is not any need of any specific battle. शूली is a synonym of Maheshvara who is always characterised with trident, though he is called having a शूल.

  

The case of चक्रतुण्ड is a different case which is not used as a common epithet or synonym generally except in the said Gayatri and the word didn't get any entry like other compounds. And this is the reason, why Sayana took it as a synonym. But Nirmalananda took it as popular name for Nandi, on its derivation, like चक्रपाणि, in the case of Vishnu, it is used as a synonym of him and in other cases, any one wearing disc in hand, it is taken as literal. This is the difference in the interpretation of both.

  

The disc of Vishnu need not any specific battle with any specific demon, but usually it is used in any battle with any enemy. Only this much is intended, he explained its derivation in the literal sense, like Cakrapani, who always carry the Cakra in his hand as he is having 4 hands. Nandin, in contrast, who is an ox, the carrier of Shiva, personified as one of the commanders of Shiva, according to Puranas, wil have to carry the disc as a weapon, only in his mouth in any battle of Shiva with demons (which is always the case) and need not any specific battle of Shiva with any particular demon, as you have understood because of the explanation of derivation of the word in the literal sense.

  

As an ox, it can use its mouth or for that, its face, with its horns, as a disc, waving it circularly like disc against the demons when his master fights with his demons. This is the metaphoric explanation of Sayana. The difference again, is the literal etymological explanation and the metaphorical explanation of the word. And need not refer to any specific episode, as disc is the common weapon, used in any battle.
