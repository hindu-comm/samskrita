The Gayatri Mantra occurs in several places in The Taittiriya Arnayaka. plee see pp 699, 744-755 and 769-799 Anand Asrama series available at [archives.org](http://archives.org). Please see Sayanas commentary on X.1.This shows there were several varying resensions of Gaytris. Syana comments only on 6. Other recension probably had more Gayatris. Again in the same Aranyaka X, 1 invokes 12 more including Chakratunda- Nandi. The Maha Narayana Upanishad belonging to Taittiriya shakha has as many as 18 Gaytris invoking beside other deities.  
  
Chakratunda (Garra gotyla) are found in the Epics (Hora, 1951).  
  

These might be the possible place to look for their legends and stories.
