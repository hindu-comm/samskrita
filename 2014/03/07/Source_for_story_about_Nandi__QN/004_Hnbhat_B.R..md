The word चक्रतुण्ड occurs inचक्रतुण्डाय धीमहि TA.10.1.5d.

  

and in no other Gayatri and the explanation I have given is from the same reference to the derivation of the word.

  

Why to quote other Gayatri's as well in this connection which have nothing to do with the explanation of the word in question वक्रतुण्ड or the episode asked for in support of Nirmalananda's allusion to it as a legend in support of his allusion he has made?

  

If any episode in Purana-s or Vedic texts supporting the allusion to the espisode as mentioned by Nirmalananda in his translation is welcome.
