Dear list members,

Swami Vimalananda in his edition and translation of the Mahānārāyanopaṇiṣad, comments on verse 25 in section 1 that Nandi is called **cakratuṇḍa**because he wielded the cakra as a weapon in his mouth while Shiva was battling demons.

Do any of the list members know the origin of this story or more details about it. I wasn't able to find anything in Mani's Puranic encyclopedia under either Nandi or **cakratuṇḍa.**

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
