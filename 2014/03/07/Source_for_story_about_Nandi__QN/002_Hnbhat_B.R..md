Monier Williams has the word, चक्रतुण्ड, but not as the name of Nandin:

  

चक्रतुण्ड \[ cakratuṇḍa \] \[ cakrá-tuṇḍa \] m. ( \[ °krá- \] ) " circular-beaked " , *a kind of mythical being* Lit. Suparṇ. xxiii , 4

 a kind of fish Lit. R. (B) iii , 73 , 14.  

  

He could have given the source for his information as commentaries usually do. Or you may contact him personally and ask for the source of his information.

  

According to some sources it is the name of Shiva, in his Bhairava form:

  

रूद्र बटुक क्रोधेस कालधर,चक्रतुण्डदस पाणि व्यालधर ॥  

  

And in Mahanarayanopanishat, it is the name of Nandin. The commentary of Sayana, makes it as a metaphoric name and no mention of a any episode like Nirmalananda.

  

चक्रतुण्डं चक्रमिव तुण्डं यस्य (सः)। यथा चक्रायुधं विष्णुप्रयुक्तं समुद्यद् रक्षांसि हन्ति, तथा स्वारूढपरमशिवस्य रक्षोभिः सह संगरप्रसङ्गे स्वमुखेन तान्यत्तीत्यर्थः।

  

So there the use of metaphoric adjective of Nandin, could not appear in any of the synonyms in the Dictionaries or Purana Indices, which only lists proper names and not all the metaphors. And in this case, it is cassually explained with reference to the battle of Shiva and not any episode or legend as such. I think Nirmalananda also tried to explain this much as by Sayana in English and not referring to any particular episode.
