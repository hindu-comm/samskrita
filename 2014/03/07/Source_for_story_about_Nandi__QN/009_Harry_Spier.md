Thank you Ajit,  

I believe there are three versions of the Mahānārāyana Upaniṣad

  
a) Taittirīya Araṇyaka chapter 10 (shorter version 64 chapters)  
published by Ananda Ashram with Sayana's commentary (ānandāśramasaṁskṛtagranthavālaḥ volume 36) starting page689 (downloadable from [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) )  
I believe this version is also available with Baskara's commentary and may be downloadable from the DLI (Digital Library of India). The version of Taittiriya Aranyaka with Baskara's commentary I found on [archive.org](http://archive.org) didn't go up to chapter 10.  

b) Taittirīya Araṇyaka chapter 10 (longer version 80 chapters)  
also published by Ananda Ashram with a commentary by an unknown author in volume 36 as a pariśiṣṭa beginning on page783.  

c\) Mahānārāyanopaniṣad associated with the Atharva Veda with the commentary Dīpikā by Nārāyaṇa  
The edition by Colonel G. A. Jacob, Bombay Sanskrit Series vol 35 is downloadable from DLI (maybe from [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) I'm not sure)  

Swami Vimalananda says he based his edition on all of these three versions.

The Gayatri to Nandi that contains the name "cakratuṇḍa"

tatpuruṣaya vidmahe

cakratuṇḍāya dhīmahi

tanno nandiḥ pracodayāt

is in the Taittiriya Aranyaka longer version (Ananda Ashram edition
pariśiṣṭa page 797) and in Swami Vimalananda's edition but not in the shorter version of Taittiriya Aranyaka chapter 10. The Gayatri to Nandi is in the Atharva Veda rescension edition of Jacob but with vakratuṇḍa
instead of cakratuṇḍa.
