 Here is another analysis :

  

4. The Four slokas:

4,1 There is some difference of opinion about the four most beautiful and appealing slokas mentioned in 3.1. Acording to South Indian school of pundits these slokas are 6,9,17 and 18 of Acct IV. According to Kale the four best slokas are 6, 18,19 and 20of the same Act. As per commentator Satavadhana the slokas 17,18,19,20 of the same Act are the best.

4.2.The beauty of expression and of meaning cannot be brought out in a
translation, however good, that too in a foreign language with a completely different cultural background. However, the text of all the above slokas are reproduced here in Devanagari and Roman scripts with their free rendering in English.

यास्यत्यद्य शकुंतलेति हृदयं संस्पृष्टमुत्कंठया

कंठ: स्तम्भित बाष्पवृत्तिकलुषः चिन्ताजडं दर्शनम् ।

वैक्लव्यं मम तावदीदृशमहो स्नेहादरण्यौकसः

पीड्यन्ते गृहिणः कथं नु तनया विश्लेष दु:खैर्नवैः ॥।

Yaasyatyadya shakuntaleti hridayam samsprishtam utkanthhayaa

Kanthhah stambhita baashpavrittikalushah chintaajadam darshanam

Vaiklayam mama taavadeedrishamaho snehaat aranyaukasah

Peedyante grihinah katham nu tanayaa vishlesha dukhairnavaih IV -6



The sage Kanva describes his emotions when Sakuntala is being sent to her husband’s place. He says:

“The very thought of separation from Sakumtala fills my heart with grief. My throat is choked by the tears I try to hold back. My eyes have become inert as I am deep in thought. If this is the depth of sorrow of a forest-dweller like me because of my attachment, then how much will be the mental agony of those householders at the prospect of separation from their newly wed daughters.?” 

पातुं न प्रथमं व्यवस्यति जलं युष्मास्वपीतेषु या

नादत्ते प्रियमण्डनापि भवतां स्नेहेन या पल्लवम् ।

आद्ये वः प्रथमप्रसूतिसमये यस्या भवत्युत्सवः

सेयम् याति शकुन्तला पतिगृहं सर्वैरनुज्ञाप्यताम् ॥



Paatum na prathhamam vyavasyati jalam yushmaaswapeeteshu yaa

Naadatte priyamandanaapi bhavataam snehena yaa pallavam

Aadye vah prathhama prasootisamaye yasyaa bhavatyutsavah

Seyam yaati shakuntalaa patigriham sarvairanujnaapyataam IV -9

Here Sage Kanva is addressing the trees, plants and creepers of the hermit in the following words:

“She who never wanted to drink water without watering you, she who had such love and affection for you that she never plucked your flowers or leaves though she was fond of adorning herself, she for whom your first flowering or bearing fruit was a celebration, that Sakuntala is going to her husband’s palace. May you all bid her farewell and good bye.”

अस्मान् साधु विचिन्त्य संयमधनानुच्चै: कुलं चात्मन-

स्त्वय्यस्या कथमप्यबान्धवकृताम् स्नेहप्रवृत्तिं च ताम् ।

सामान्यप्रतिपत्तिपूर्वकमियं दारेषु दृश्या त्वया

भाग्यायत्तमतःपरं न खलु तद्वाच्यं वधूबन्धुभिः \|\|

Asmaan saadhu vichintya samyamadhanaanuchchaih kulam chaatmana-

Stwayyasyaah kathamapyabaamdhava kritaam snehapravrittim cha taam

Saamaanyapratipattipoorvakamiyam daareshu drishyaa twayaa

Bhaagyaayattamatah param na khalu tadvaachyam vadhoobandhubhih IV-17

This is the message of Kanva to Dushyanta concerning Sakuntala:

“Considering us hermits whose only wealth is tapasya , your own birth in a noble family, the love of Sakuntala for you in bringing about which her relatives had no role, you, as her husband, should give her an equal status and love among your wives. Anything beyond this will depend on her bhaagya or luck, the relatives of the bride have no say about that. “

शुश्रूषस्व गुरून् कुरु प्रियसखीवृत्तिं सपत्नीजने

भर्तुर्विप्रकृतापि रोषणतया मा स्म प्रतीपं गमः

भूयिष्ठं भव दक्षिणा परिजने भाग्येष्वनुत्सेकिनी

यान्त्येवं गृहिणीपदं युवतयः वामाः कुलस्याधयः 

Shushrooshaswa guroon kuru priyasakheevrittim sapatnee jane

Bharturviprakrutaapi roshanatayaa maa sma prateepam gamah

Bhooyishtthham bhava dakshinaa parijane bhaagyeshwanutsekinee

Yaantyevam grihineepadam yuvatayah vaamaah kulasyaadhayah IV-18

This is the advice of Kanva to Sakuntala:

“Listen to your in-laws and elders and serve them, look upon the other wives of the King as your dear friends, even when you get angry with your husband keep your cool and do not act on impulse, be generous with your servants, do not be conceited about your good fortunes. By following these dictums you will acquire the status of a true housewife. Those who do the opposite cause great mental agony to the family.

अभिजनवतो भर्तुः श्लाघ्ये स्थिता गृहिणीपदे

विभवगुरुभिः कृत्यैस्तस्य प्रतिक्षणमाकुला ।

तनयमचिरात् प्राचीवार्कं प्रसूय च पावनं

मम विरहजां न त्वम् वत्से शुचं गणयिष्यसि ॥

Abhijanavato bhartuh shlaaghye sthhitaa grihineepade

Vibhavagurubhih krityaistasya pratikshanamaakulaa

Tanayamachiraat praacheevarkam prasooya cha paavanam

Mama virahajaam na twam vatse shucham ganayishyasi IV-19

Establishing yoursef as the laudable grihini (housewife) of your husband of noble birth, always being excited about the weighty matters of state in wich he is engaged and having given birth to a son before long like the Sun by the East, you shall not, my dear, worry about my pangs of separation from you.

भूत्वा चिराय चतुरन्त महीसपत्नी

दौष्यन्तिमप्रतिरथं तनयं निवेश्य

भर्त्रा तदर्पित कुटुंबभरेणसाकं

शान्ते करिष्यसि पदं पुनराश्र्मेऽस्मिन्

Bhootwaa chiraaya chaturantha mahee sapatnee

Daushyantimapratiratham tanayam niveshya

Bhartraa tadarpita kutmbabharena saardham

Shaante karishyasi padam punaraashramesmin IV-20

Remain long as the sapatnee (co-wife) of Mahee (the whole of earth
personified, being figuratively another wife of the King). Give birth to Dushyanta’s son who will later become a king of unmatched valour. Vest
in him the responsibilities of the family and the kingdom. Then will you again come back to this peaceful hermitage with your husband.
