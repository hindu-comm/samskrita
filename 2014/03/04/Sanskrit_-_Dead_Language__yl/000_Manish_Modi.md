Dear Usha ji,

Pranam

  

Thank you for writing with such precision and clarity on a subject which could have been dealt with in an extremely jingoistic manner. I love Sanskrit and Prakrit and Pali but it would be a considerable stretch of the imagination to say that anyone speaks these languages as their mother tongue.

  

Sure, millions of Hindus and Jains and Buddhists recite mantras and prayers in Sanskrit/Prakrit/Pali. But do any of us really speak these languages as our mother tongues?

  

However, why is it necessary for a language to be spoken as a mother tongue for it to be considered alive? Is it not sufficient that people consider the language to be close to their hearts and recite mantras/stotras/stutis and pathas in that language? If a language is used, if only for the purpose of divine invocation, it is still being used. So why consider the language to be dead?

  

There is a great deal of effort in India to revive Sanskrit as a spoken language. I attend various Sanskrit conferences and it is edifying to see the enthusiasm of pre-teens and teenagers in learning Sanskrit. However, those who wish to further the cause of Sanskrit and widen its base shall have to take steps to de-link Sanskrit from religion and caste.

  

Imo, students would benefit from learning Sanskrit at an early age when their memorising faculties are at their peak.

Sanskrit ought to be taught in schools as the fourth language after the first language (medium of instruction), the national language (Hindi) and the local language (depending on the state).

  

I learnt Sanskrit after I was 40 and hence struggle to speak it. However, it has opened several doors for me as far as ancient and medieval Indian literature is concerned. I am certain that had I learnt it at the age of 6 or so, I would be able to speak it spontaneously and translate it unaided. And also be able to compose verse and commentary in Sanskrit.

  

A Jain monk translated Richard Bach's English novel 'Jonathan Livinston Seagull' into Sanskrit. I have also seen (and sold) a brilliant translation of Pratibha Rai's Oriya novel 'Yajnaseni' into Sanskrit. And an excellent adaptation of Kavi Banarasidas' Brajbhasha masterpiece 'Ardhakathanak\*' into Sanskrit. More representative works of modern literature ought to be translated into and published in Sanskrit. I cannot think of a better way to promote a language than to make elements of popular culture available in it!

  

Imagine if Sanskrit-loving cricket fans had the option of watching their favourite team perform accompanied by a Sanskrit commentary! Wouldn't it be wonderful? I would love to see graphic novels in Sanskrit. And a whole host of publications in Sanskrit. Even a magazine for film buffs in Sanskrit!

  

We need someone with the marketing genius of Lalit Modi (without his less than transparent modus operandi) to really take Sanskrit to the masses.

  

I am game to participate in any effort to promote Sanskrit as long as it clearly and distinctly de-linked from any religion, caste, political party, gender, race, ethnicity, etc. Like any other language in the world, Sanskrit is for everyone. It does not belong to one religion/caste/gender/nation/race. Let everyone study it.

  

\* 'Ardhakathanak' is the first ever autobiography written by an Indian.

  

Best regards,

Manish Yashodhar Modi
