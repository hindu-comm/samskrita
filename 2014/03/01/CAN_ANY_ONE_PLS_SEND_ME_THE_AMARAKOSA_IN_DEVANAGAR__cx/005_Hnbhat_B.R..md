Thanks for clarifying the request. I too had given the same link. But it contains only pdf in Unicode Devanagari Text.

  

Here is the web page containing Amara Text typed in Devanagari fonts and I do not know whether it is Unicode Devanagari or not.

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/amarfin1_sa.html>  

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/amarfin2_sa.html>  

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/amarfin3_sa.html>  

  

The three parts could be copied and pasted in word file.

  

The text can be copied into a word file and he can get word document or rtf file or can use the page for searching purpose online. Here it is complete in the sanskrit vicki source.
