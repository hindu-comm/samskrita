Not trying to be augmentative here but isolated cases cannot be generalized. If this happens across a cross section of a population then one can consider that .  

SB circles have their mission to make Sanskrit a spoken language and ensure that more people learn the language to better understand our glorious past How does this change the linguistic model applicable for a dead language Thanks
