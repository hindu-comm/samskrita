Here is the solution for your doubts:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/eIFaVRj5q44/5N8NgRe6VkAJ>

  

Please check. I think in some other Sanskrit Groups also there should have been such circulations before each census and all Sanskrit Knowing people are requested to declare as their mother tounge.

  

And for your information, linguistic definition of "native speaker" I have given in my first post itself.

  

Here is the linguistic definition of "mother toungue"

  

as:

One's native language; the language learned by children and passed from one generation to the next.

  

Here is an explanation of the concept:  

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language>  

  

A first language (also native language, mother tongue, arterial language, or L1) is the language(s) a person has learned from birth

(^ Bloomfield, Leonard. Language)

and many other definitions and elaboration of the concept. And it is not the government that defines these terms.

  

By the first definition, any language learnt by birth is called mother language or 1st language and its speakers are native speakers of the language.

  

And to your other questions, relying on census, why not earlier than 2001 (many years after Mattur village was declared as Sanskrit Language), they were not recorded? Was they barred from recording it as their mother toungue or there was no colum 14 in the census form to gather such information. The last seems to be probable. But in that case, no such request in this group was needed in this group and in other related to Sanskrit.

  

This last remark has nothing to do with linguistic classification.

  

Anyway, a language linguistically declared as dead,(unlike medically declared person) can be declared as living language and need not be continued to be called as such, as in the case of Latin and Hebrew as I have shown in my first post. This is theoretically possible in the case of Sanskrit also.

  

No need of Govt. census nor Govt. Statutory notice or Declaration by Supreme judgement to declare it as living language, which is a hypothetical concept in linguistics.

  

The first question itself, was whether any book or article published in any journals considering all or any of the points raised by Mme. Usha and the reply is welcome on this point. I just reflected on the title as Dead Language and the linguistic concept.
