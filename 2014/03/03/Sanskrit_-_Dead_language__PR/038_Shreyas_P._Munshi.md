A line from Shri Naresh Cuntoor Sir's mail reads:

"Some people want to keep Samskrit reserved for certain things they consider sacred, and that';s their prerogative."  

I thinkthese are the people who come in way of Sanskrit becoming the language of the masses. They call Samskrit 'the language of the gods', 'girvaaNaBhaashaa' etc which has the hidden connotation that thislanguage is not for the common man. Unless this 'language of the gods' notion is wiped out, to me it seems, Sanskrit will never become the language of the masses. And today, perhaps because of this 'language of the gods' syndrome, wherever enthusiasts are teaching Sanskrit SambhaashaNa, the majority of students are Brahmins. I attened SamskritaBharati's 15 day residential Sambhashana course in 2010 near Delhi and found that, in my batch of some 50, only one was a non-brahmin, a bania from Somnath,Gujarat.
