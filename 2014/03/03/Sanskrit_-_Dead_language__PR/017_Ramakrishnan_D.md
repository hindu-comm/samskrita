Yes, I totally agree with Dr.Phanikumar .  In addition I wish to add that, the language Samskritam is quite living in our country since times immemorial, feeding all native languages and languages in neibouring countiries and even the Europian languages.  It is never dead. 
Because we were subjugated by the foreign rule, especially the British, who were intolerant to see that Samskritam is the base for all the subjects like Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Astrology, Astronomy, Arts, Music etc. etc., in India, and it was flurishing. They alienated
it by slowly introducing English into the native people to make them their slaves giving small jobs like clerical ones.

  

Even in those days Samskritam was never dead.  People were talking at least to the extent that many Veda pathasalas were there teaching samskritam, Peethams of swamijis were/are there in nook and corner using the language, preaching the subjects of Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas etc.
 It is a known fact to everybody that all the rituals in our families are conducted in that language knowingly or unknowingly.  Then, how it is a dead language ? 

It was only a conspiracy by the then rulers to make English as a ruling language for their convenience and make the natives their tools to serve.

And we accepted it as dead.  Even today, many of our scholors agree to be so. 

The time has come for us to say that it is not dead and it is quite alive.

At the same time we have to make efforts to make people learn the language, Samskritam, speak in it and make it your own speaking language.  It is not selfish to say so.  It is only with the greatness /richness of the language in all subjects that we have to study that. 
If it is made our National language/Official language of the country, that will be great.

Regards to one and all.
