I have nothing new to add, except that I do not see any significant new  
literature in Sanskrit. As I have posted in the past, a big gap remains  
between ground zero and the more  
abstract/technical/religious/ritualistic/priestly works that occupy the  
interest and attention of most people on this list.  
  
I keep hearing how children need to learn Sanskrit, but even if they  
learn the grammar, where is the context to apply that grammar. I refuse  
to believe that Sanskrit is only about chanting mantras, stotras, etc.  
If some of our scholars (no I am not one) could slowly create that  
environment in the form of written and oral literature appropriately  
suited for various age groups and graded from the simple to the complex,  
that would be nice. I guess even translations from other languages  
should suffice for now in this vacuum, though ideally original works  
would be the best.  
  
This is my very personal opinion, again please excuse me - but I wonder  
why people spend their entire time proving some esoteric point or the  
other - why not give some attention to truly try and bring sanskrit  
alive to some degree instead. I always wonder out aloud, if I can breach  
the barrier and be as fluent as people in the 10th or 11th century. Of  
course the environment doesnt exist anymore, and yet that fascination  
remains.  
  
Regardless of the technicalities, Sanskrit is dead for me so far (I am  
only progressing in the grammar which doesnt qualify it as knowing a  
language as a whole for me). Whether I can bring it back to life, at  
least for myself, remains a challenge. I should be able to pick up any  
unknown piece of work in sanskrit, and if the vocabulary is not  
specialized or technical pertaining to a certain domain like medicine or  
mathematics or etc --- then I should be able to read the same without  
resorting to bidirectional translation either inside or outside my head.  
Then it becomes living for me at least as far as the written medium goes.  
  
Thank you for reading,
