Sir, You need to read more. I have heard this reasoning before, "Samskritam was language of Brahmins and those on horse back coming into India and gave it to Brahmins etc". The question is not about what threshold of numbers defines a language to be dead or alive. It is your and nhbhat ji's contention that there are no people existing whose mother tongue is Samskritam anymore. Now you moved your goal post and say that few people could be people could be speaking Samskritam as their mother tongue so what? What nonnsense, have a firm stand and define your position. Is it numbers of speakers which define a language as living or the nativity? please make up your mind.  
  
And do read up more, to know if Samskritam was localized to Brahmins or was an universal language of the masses, please peddle your opinions as facts.  
  
Regards,  
Venu
