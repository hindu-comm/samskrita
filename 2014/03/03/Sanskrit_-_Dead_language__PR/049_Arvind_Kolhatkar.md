ken p,

  

I could not understand this remark of yours \<*Are students taught Sanskrit in it's original script or in it's modification to Devanagari script? Hindi promoters may not try to impose Hindi but trying to propagate it's script through learning Sanskrit so people can read Hindi.>*

Are you suggesting that there exists another script which is 'the original script' of Sanskrit? As far as is known, Sanskrit has been written in the Devanagari script after the so-called 'BrahmI' scriptdisappeared from use around the 8th century. (I call it 'so-called'because that appears to be an invented name for a script in which all epigraphical material - stone-carved inscriptions, copper-plate grants - is written. It was completelyforgottenlike the Egyptian Hieroglyphic, tillrediscoveredin the 1830's by theefforts of Prinsep and other workers. What was its name of it by which its users called it is not known. Also not known is how old it was and whether it too had a predecessor/s.)

  

So my question. What is the 'original script' that you are referring to? And are you suggesting that because Devanagari is not the 'original' script of Sanskrit, it should be given up and replaced by the Roman script so that the onslaught of Hindi over regional languages will be halted?

  

Devanagari-scripted languages like Marathi are certainly under the threat of being swept away by English and Hindi but the causes for it are to be sought elsewhere and not in the fact that Marathi also uses Devanagari as a script, just as Hindi does.. Marathi has been using Devanagari as its script since the earliest written records in Marathi known from the 9th century onwards. Marathi lovers and speakers are not blaming Devanagari for its current decline, nor are they demanding the removal of Devanagari. They are quite happy with Devanagari and will resist any attempt to replace it with anything else.

  

An attempt to replace all Indian scripts with the Roman script was made in the 1830s by Missionaries of Serampore and by a few evangelically-minded British officials in Calcutta. This, they thought, would help spread of Christianity among the 'heathens'. However, this attempt was foiled by the staunch support given to Indian scripts by 'orientalists' like Prinsep (This was at the time when, following Macaulay. a decision was reached that the Indian education system needs drastic changes and infusion of the English language and science.)
