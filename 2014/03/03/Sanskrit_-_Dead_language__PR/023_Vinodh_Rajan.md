I would suppose at least most (if not some) just wanted to make a statement of supporting Sanskrit by declaring it as a known/native language.

  

The following mail was sent to me in 2010 "encouraging" me to declare Sanskrit as a known language in the Indian census:

  

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  

After opposing the caste based census, \[...\] now wants citizens to voluntarily register Sanskrit as their

second language in the census.

  

\[...\] feels that if people register the language, the final census

data would reflect higher literacy of Sanskrit, which will force the

government to take measures to preserve the language.

  

“According to the last census, only 14,135 people knew Sanskrit and

the language ranked 118 among all Indian languages. The result was

that the government listed Sanskrit as an in-danger language like

Arabi and Pharsi,” said \[...\]

  

\[...\]

  

Emphasising the importance of the language, Deopujari said that

whoever speaks an Indian language knows at least 50 per cent Sanskrit

words as Sanskrit is the mother of most languages
