Namaste. I know of Sri Dorbala Prabhakara sarma'jis grand child learning sanskrit from his mother and conversing with her in sanskrit.I had the pleasure of staying in SB's guesthouse for a week at bangalore a year ago which was surrounded by residential qtrs. There I saw very young children of sri nagaraj mahodaya,sri lakshminarayana mahodaya,sri satyanarayana mahodaya converse in sanskrit with their mothers fluently as one would in one,s mother tongue. I understand so is the case in dr janardan hegde and sri chamu krishna sastryji's households as well.samskruta kutumbam is a well known concept in SB circles. Thank you.

Dear Venugopal,  

Ar Dr. Bhat has answered your question. Linguistically speaking of a dead language has nothing got to do with census, government policy , artificial existence of Sanskrit speakers are emotional writings of individuals. Linguistics is a precise and exact science and works on known and tested models for all languages including Sanskrit. Census is a statistical science, government policy is dictated by voters and linguists is based of certain axioms and on which theory and hypothesis is developed  

I have never heard or know of any person living or dead except perhaps in legends who learnt Sanskrit from his or Her mother for the language to be called mother tongue by any definition standards.
