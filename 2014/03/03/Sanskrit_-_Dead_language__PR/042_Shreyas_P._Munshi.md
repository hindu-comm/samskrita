A line from Shri Phani Kumar Sir's email:

"You think there ought to have been a prohibition against Brahmins? "

  

No Sir. No Sir. On the contrary, I strongly believe that there can not be and should never be allowed, tolerated or encouraged, any type of prohibition or restriction on learning by any individual or a section of humans anywhere in the world, just as lower caste-upper caste labelling, and then behaving in that manner,and also making others to behave in that manner, should never be allowed. So, without going into historical elaboration which Dr Ambedker has done in plenty in his writings, the point I was trying to make is that because of the elitist status given to Sanskrit by a section of the society,non-Brahmins do not easily volunteer for learning Sanskrit. They have a mistaken notion that Sanskrit is for Brahmins and not for them, and by tradition and inheritance, Brahmins do not need any persuasion for learning Sanskrit.One cant escape noticing that even in the fraternity in which we are communicating, the majority consists of Brahmins. And I feel that unless we propagate the idea among the common people that the language Sanskrit is like any other language and is fit for (and allowed to be learnt and used by) by all sections of our society, more so because Sanskrit by its very design is ever-modern and more computer-friendly,Sanskrit will never become the language of the masses that SamskritaBharati have envisioned.Of course nobody today prevents a non-Brahmin from learning Sanskrit (everyone is welcome), but to me it seems that there does remain a great need to motivatenon-Brahmins to learn Sanskrit.I thought the beginning could be made by wiping of the 'language of the gods' syndrome and calling it 'ourlanguage' or something like that which would make Sanskrit more inclusive. This was my humble submission as a beginning learner.  
With profound regards...Shreyas

Sir,You will forgive my inability to follow the drift of your thesis. I could follow the argument that sanskrit should be pulled down from its pedestal whether I see eye to eye with you on that or not. But I could not quite follow the point you were trying to make when you said that all participants save one in a certain course were brahmins. You think there ought to have been a prohibition against brahmins even If the participation in the course was voluntary, or no matter what you do only brahmins will participate in such courses?  
Dont you think,sir, it is time we raised the level of this discourse?

A line from Shri Naresh Cuntoor Sir's mail reads:

"Some people want to keep Samskrit reserved for certain things they consider sacred, and that';s their prerogative."  

I thinkthese are the people who come in way of Sanskrit becoming the language of the masses. They call Samskrit 'the language of the gods', 'girvaaNaBhaashaa' etc which has the hidden connotation that thislanguage is not for the common man. Unless this 'language of the gods' notion is wiped out, to me it seems, Sanskrit will never become the language of the masses. And today, perhaps because of this 'language of the gods' syndrome, wherever enthusiasts are teaching Sanskrit SambhaashaNa, the majority of students are Brahmins. I attened SamskritaBharati's 15 day residential Sambhashana course in 2010 near Delhi and found that, in my batch of some 50, only one was a non-brahmin, a bania from Somnath,Gujarat.  
Submitted in all humility...Shreyas
