Dear Ken

,  


  
I suggest you to please see the complete thread. This thread is too old and we are not adding anything substatntial to the debate. If you are talking about spellings and difficulty or easy to learn (Which is relative

 you may find Sanskrit difficult I find English Latin Greek difficult)

) as a criteria to determine if a language is dead or not you are mistaken

.

Don't advise me which group I need to join I am glad you are in Samskrita group. Its you who raised the topic ease or difficult to learn a language is a criteria to determine if a language is Living or Dead  

  

Regards
