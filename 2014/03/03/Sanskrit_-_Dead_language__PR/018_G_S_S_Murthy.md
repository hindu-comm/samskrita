Dear all,

Sanskrit is certainly not dead and will not die. But it is far from being a dynamic and vibrant language.

Large majority of Sanskrit scholars and lovers is only interested in studying and glorifying the hoary glorious past of Sanskrit. A language can be vibrant if it responds and has the capability to respond to changing times. Even those who are competent in fields other than Sanskrit and are also competent in Sanskrit do not attempt to create new branches of knowledge in Sanskrit.It is a pity that Sanskrit has become a hostage to traditionalists. Beyond editing and re-editing old manuscripts and texts very little meaningful contribution to Sanskrit is happening. It is a pity that even today the best of Sanskrit studies is getting done in foreign universities.

Regards,

Murthy
