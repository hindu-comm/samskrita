Usha ji,

  

Namaste, Not a scholar, but Samskritam is by no means dead. If day to day usage of a language is what defines a language to be dead or like, then Samskritam is no way dead yet. Currently there are 1lakh+ speakers. Some villages even have active speakers and also in one particular village in India, only Samskritam is spoken. Certainly as you wished, what I am providing is not academic, but proof in their own right that Smaskritam is not lost or that it is dead language.

  

pl see:

Yesterday in Samskrita Bharati annual meeting, they have said that the Samskritam speakers in India have rosen to about 1lakh+. If you search wiki on the web, certainly you will find Sanskrit listed as one of the dead languages. But this is not entirely true. Mattur village has active speakers who speak Samskritam in daily life.
