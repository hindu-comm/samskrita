Zeroth, but you didn't answer my question. Can, according to you, the kid who grew up speaking English in an 'artificial' English environment (to use your formulation) - call English his mother tongue? If yes, does that logic extend to a Samskrit-speaking kid? If not, why?  

  
First, comparison to Middle English, old English or such is not the appropriate because an average speaker of English today won't be able to understand the older forms, unlike with Samskrit. That was the point I made earlier with reanimating the ancients. In fact, why don't you try that experiment? Try reading Beowulf in old English!  
  

Second, regarding 'never a mother tongue in the past' - again, this has been discussed in the past and examples have been shown to support the counter-view - incidentally from the same Mahabhashya that was thrown by someone :)  
I am sure you can dig up the archives. But if one is only satisfied by pratyaksha pramaaNa, there isn't much to say unless we can figure out time-travel anytime soon. So I'll leave it at that.  
  

Third, about the future. What is natural to one society may be quite artificial to another, no? Or vice-versa. Would you say that a kid who has grown up articulating his/her thoughts in Samskrit from the beginning is any less natural than you? Is he/she waiting for a certification from a linguist to say that he is speaking in the native? Or is he/she simply going about his everyday life and throwing tantrums like every other kid?  
  

Coming back to the present - about census. Look, you and I know that there is a political element to this - 'political' not in a bad way, but in a sense that one wants to assert one's identity. We could talk about means and ends and what is justified till the chickens come home to roost or whatever it is that they do. But that is a response that evolved in today's context. And that's that.  
  
Without referring to anyone in particular, I find it amusing that it is usually people who wax eloquently about India's pluralism and all that care so much about counting the number of people, only to deny things to groups that are deemed not big enough. Miniscule minority or not, people exist. At least in the case of Samskrit speakers, it is possible to create a group that is too big to ignore! That, to me, seems the point of responding the way they did to census.  
  
  

Getting off my soapbox,  

Naresh
