Yes kids whose parents speaks English is a English speaking kid, whose parents speak Tamil is a Tamil speaking kid. My point is Sanskrit was never a spoken language of the masses. It was an artificial language of the elite which bound the elite. So why force a child to learn Sanskrit in an artificial way?

Will that preserve our heritage. I don't think so. Sanskrit is best preserved if it learnt and thought the way any language should be learnt and thought. Whats the best method I will leave that out to experts.

  
  

First, comparison to Middle English, old English or such is not the appropriate because an average speaker of English today won't be able to understand the older forms, unlike with Samskrit. That was the point I made earlier with reanimating the ancients. In fact, why don't you try that experiment? Try reading Beowulf in old English!

In linguistics, **language death** (also **language extinction**, **linguistic extinction** or **linguicide**, and rarely also **glottophagy**) is a process that affects speech communities where the level of linguistic competence that speakers possess of a given language variety is decreased, eventually resulting in no native or fluent speakers of the variety. Language death may affect any language idiom, including dialects and languages.The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one language becomes bilingual in another language, and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original (or heritage) language. I quote wiki here

.



  

Mahabhashya was quoted more as Subhashita why take it literally?



Even If you take it literally it makes sense to the current debate does it not?

Why Should a kid articulate or start thinking in Sanskrit why cant the kid do it in its own natural Mother Tongue



?. The future of the language is best secured if all study our culture in a dispassionate way taking more scholay interests producing greater relavent books and rasing the standard of research.
