Dear venu Gopal,  
  

Sorry if I sound bit blunt but this is the best way to put across what is needed now. I have and other members have indicated this topic has been discussed a thousand times over without any conclusions.  
  

You can read elementary Linguistics book which classifies how languages are dead which is a technical terms before you asks for proofs. If you cannot understand elementary points raised please say so. If Mahabhashya is not authority for you for me and for grammarians and sanskritists from thousands of years it is.  

  

Nobody in the past thousand years have claimed Sanskrit is their mother tongue except for Sanskrit enthusiasts who may not have bothered to read any source materiel primary or secondary Government and it policies or census department is not the source of Sanskrit language or its linguistics This much I can say in conclusion Thanks a lot for you time on this  

  

Regards
