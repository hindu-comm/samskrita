Let me now get into your line of thinking. Sanskrit existed for thousands of years because it is apart of culture it is the language of the elite. Sanskrit thus has an honored place. Let me add I love Sanskrit hence I am on this list.  
  
41,000 probable speakers out 100 crore population. Majority of the respondents would have said they speak sanskrit and understand not that it is their mother tongue. Even if it is their mother tonguedon't you think they have said so figuratively or they love the language they want to save it so they would have said so. Now does your stastics 24,000 out of 100 crore population make any sense not to me sorry.  
  

Linguistics is not based of this statistics or census survey conducted or government policy or enthusiasts over exaggeration of facts and arguments. I hope this helps.  
  

Let me end it here instead of going to point by refutation method. Thanks again
