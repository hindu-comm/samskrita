Dear Ajit ji  
  
Namaste, According to GoI 2001 census, even for that matter 2011 census, there are native speakers in India whose mother tongue is Sanskrit. What does that mean? is GoI's definition of native speakers wrong? or that native Sanskrit speakers do exist? if they don't exist and somehow GoI figures are wrong, why are they wrong? if for other reasons, one can rely on census, why not now?
