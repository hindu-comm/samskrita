If Sanskrit is spoken by ordinary folks it is because they have learnt it as language that doesn't mean Sanskrit is a language of a native speaker or it their mother tongue or is their own natural tongue all mean one an the same in common parlance.  

If your limited knowledge was about language Then do you propose all parents start teaching their children in Sanskrit not in their mother tongue which sanskrit is not. Thanks for letting me know India is a free country by quating plitically motivated census figures .  

Ordinary folks are for me people Ido day to day business none of them speak in Sanskrit and will ever probably you might but if you do no one will ever understand you I hope you get my point.  
  

Before you say I belabor my point pleas see the entire thread completely and you will know what I am saying.  
  

This is a one line point I have been saying over and over again and yet you keep harping with your point either with a story in Sanskrit which made no sense or accuse me of changing my stance.  
  

This is my point. Linguistically speaking Sanskrit is a dead language ( I have defined what a dead language is) except in Elite scholarly circles or with enthusiasts who want to speak in Sanskri
