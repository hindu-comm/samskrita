Sri hnbhat ji,

  

Thank you for the correction, then according to this 2001 Gov of Indian census of Sanskrit as mother tongue:

<http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm>  
  
Am I missing something? the above cannot be considered as native speakers? even though their mother tongue is Sanskrit?

  

Regards,

Venu
