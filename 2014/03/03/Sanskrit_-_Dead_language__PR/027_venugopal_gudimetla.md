Sir, this is circular logic which might be pleasing to your own reasoning quite a linguistic feat really. I would request you kindly entertain me logic than quote "your master's voice" or that you studied by rote. If Samskritam existed for thousand years in India, does it mean that it spoken or was it because it became a part of every day life? it is pathetic that Indians have to rely on western scholars to be told about history of their languages were. It is evern more pathetic that "scholar" like your self peddle nonsense in the name of scholarship. No Body even claimed Hindusim as their religion, who would know some "scholars" who come questioning it. I pray you use logic and data presented than memorized learning. What is the point of quoting Mahbhashyam when people have presented you with data that there could be some Samskritam speakers whose mother tongue could be Samskritam? it is a more a statistical question. I hope you are able to appreciate what I am trying to ask you. If there are 41000 probable speakers, what is the probability that some could be calling Smaskritam their mother tongue. If I am presenting your data, why are you asking me to refer some linguistic book? do you mean to say that linguistics cannot be ever be wrong? and people whose mother tongue is indeed is Samskritam are deluded?
