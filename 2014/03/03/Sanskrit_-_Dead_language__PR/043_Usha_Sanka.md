***Samskrtam as a Language***

This is strictly keeping aside the census, or otherLinguistic Survey of India orPLSIdata issues raised in the thread- I have been with Samskrtam since my childhood. I have a bondage with her. But it is not that emotion speaking here-

Before applying dead language definition, one should also try applying living language elements to Samskrtam.

I heard my Gurudeva speaking in Samskrtam. He speaks so fluently, never searching or stumbling for words. I also heard Shankaracharyas of Kanchi and Sringeri speaking in Samskrtam.

There are many a vyAkaraNa scholars in my state and others as well, whom I have heard (because of some good deeds I must have done) giving proficient elaborations on different Samskrtam and non-Samskrtam subjects in beautiful heart filling Samskrtam. The interesting thing is that never have been to Samskrita Bharati clases. The language has not come to them artificially. It was from a tradition, a continuous paramparA. They got it from their gurus, and they from theirs. Still they manage to speak idiomatically. That means Samskrtam is not bereft of the power of being spoken as a natural language, even of does not come from mother, at early childhood. Though she comes later than one's mother tongue, she has capacity to fully *become* one.



***Places where we find Samskrtam***

Mathas were great centres of learning the academic Shastras. One example from that paramparA.. a vidvat sabhA where exams are conducted in Samskrtam-

The sage of Kanchi was taught not only Vedanta but all academic shastras like logic, meemamsa, yoga etc. OK, considering their strong branding (as religious institutes), it is difficult for others to understand their academic value. Well, setting them aside, what about Vidyapeethas? My Tirupati Vidhyapeetha has many a Samskrtam scholars who fluently converse, give speeches in the Divine Language. They have never been to Samskrita Bharati classes and had speaking abilities even before Samskrita Bharati, or for that matter its maker, gave out first birth cry. (In fact the idea head of Samskrita Bharati himself originated from here.) Scholars here, from different language mother-tongued though, learnt her from very early periods of their lives, can write books, teach lessons, write poetry, sing songs, conduct quizzes, competitions in Samskrtam. One can find students learning, arguing, fighting, joking and even teasing each other in Samskrtam. New vocabulary is continuously building.. not just coined, but it is as good as that found in old texts. I just want to say, that like house hold speech (as cited by others in the thread), we have academic institutions as well, where Samskrtam as language fulfills all the conditions of a living language.

***Considering the definition ***

She has been more alive than English - as the point has already been made. English of some 100 years back is unintelligible today. Even Old Tamil has same fate. But Samskrtam- NO.So can we strictly declare her dead?May be the answer lies somewhere in between when it comes to Samskrtam issue. She is not alive in terms of 1. Being mother tongue 2. Having Native speakers 3. Having certain number of population.

But she is not dead *linguistically* in the sense that she is 1. understood without help first hand with even bare knowledge -when one reads texts like Ramayana and puranas (unlike Kavyas which are artificial), 2. she flows with nuances on the tongue of anyone who *learns* her(experience of many a student who learnt her including me)3. People create new ideas and works without artificial effort like we can see here in the avadhAnam-

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3GnorRNjXE>  

4. There *IS* original literature unstopped, flowing like River Ganga amidst all these adversities, all these years in the form of many a Samskrtam periodicals, (<http://sanskritdocuments.org/news/SanskritNewspapersandMagazines.html>)mahakAvyas \[<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/ASSP/Mahakavya.htm>\]There was a book published by Sahitya Academy which gave all post-independence literature in Indian languages, and one chapter was devoted for Samskrtam as well- It gives names of many Samskrtam original works!!

\[Are all these Samskrita Bharati motivated or created or artificial? Are they not natural in some sense of the word? at least?\] They arenot just translated works 5. She has avicchinna parampara in atleast some places like mathas and vidyapeethas which have been holding her for us to this day – the same natural idiom very much alive, not at all connected with Samskrita Bharati or Sri Chamu Shastri in any way. (so – she is not “created” again like Hebrew)

******

***Ever Spoken?***

Coming to the question- her ever being a spoken language, yes- it is again unlike issue of Mother tongue and natural language, but ever very much spoken as we come across many such Panini sutras (उदीचामातः स्थाने यकपूर्वायाः ७।३।४६ -<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/7.3.46.htm>उदीचाम् आचार्याणां मतेन यकारपूर्वायाः ककारपूर्वायाश्च आतः स्थाने यो ऽकारः, तस्यातः स्थाने इकरादेशो भवति। उदीचां ग्रहणं विकल्पार्थम्। इभ्यिका, इभ्यका। क्षत्रियिका, क्षत्रियका। ककारपूर्वायाः चटकिका, चटकका। )which are meaningless is she were only a “written” language. Many sentences in Ramayana and Mahabharata have natural flowy idiomatic expressions, full of liveliness and vigour. We have arthashastra, subhashitas, jyotisha, ayurveda, pasushastra, ganitam and even kAma shastra- (do not know if there was a krodha shastra as well :) ) etc. books written in Samskrtam. Is it possible that writing books for a non-spoken language be practical? Why would everyone choose to write only in Samskrtam if none spoke her at all? She was never imposed on anyone like what happened during Non-Indian rulers' times with *Parsi, Arabbi* etc. No rulers imposed her as a language or her subjects (Yes- it happened with Buddhism during King Ashoka's rule - but they were Pali-ists and Prakritsits, not strictly Samskrtists) Nor was ever she made to be used inevitably like present day English (without knowledge of which one is not considered "Educated" at all!! So- indirectly imposing!!)



It must be a want of reason issue. I have not existed in those times (even if I did, would not be allowed access to those memories; even if I had access, I would have to answer many questions before people would be convinced), so I cannot answer. I only think in simple terms like observing– what we do today. We write books in English, other languages because we know there are people who speak them. One cannot just write so many day to day issues, life and worldly issues if she were not spoken in any point of time in history at all.

***vyAkaraNa for a non-spoken language?***

And what for will a vyAkaraNa be written? Can you write vyAkaraNa for a strictly a non-spoken language? Recently declared state Telangana has a Telugu (called Telangana) entirely different from what can be called as Andhra Telugu, and a professor I know has written first Grammar book for her. One cannot barely write a vyAkaraNa just like that for a bookish language. And it was not just Panini, but many others later wrote many grammars. Was it all for a non-spoken language? She would have died a natural death had she ever been only written, bookish, elite language.



***Elite-brAhmaNa-priestly***

So, here comes next issue- one more branding- that She is elite, brAhmana, priestly, ritualistic language alone; No- it is one of "created" impressions by haters of this language and country something done deliberately like AIT. Even if it did, then we should be happy that "elitists" "brAhmanas" and "priests" saved her for us, to this day!!!!

And she was never used by women is even more disgusting abhiyoga!!! No, there have been women authors in Samskrtam as well. There are even vedic RShikas!!We find women characters conversing in Prakrit only in dRshya-kavyas. That cannot be given as an evidence for women being non-Samskrtam.When we see Ramayana / Mahabharata/ Bhagavata there is no distinction for women’s language. (this is how I understood the issue) Hanuman only says- if I speak too polished, posh a language (because he was nava-vyakarana pandita) then Sita might confuse me for Ravana (as that fellow was good at all scholastics and put them aside conveniently)- not that she does not know Samskrtam. People did not want women to be burdened with knowledge affairs (because of many sensitive and prone areas in her life) and they had always non-academic things to perform more, so were less conversant and fluent in Samskrtam- that’s a different issue.



Mathas as they often are "branded", cannot be treated wholly as priestly. In the centres like Vidyapeetha, it is not always brAhmanas who learn her academically.In Vidyapeethas she is not limited to “priestly” affairs.In fact my Vidyapeetha has special center for non OC categoried students! And we all learnt the shastra in Samskrtam! vyAkaraNa etc. shastras are taught in Samskrtam medium strictly academically (to all castes, creeds and sects) and have nothing in common with “priestly” affairs. Initially I did not know much Samskrtam when I joined newly there, but once I started, I picked up in few days, and never found her unintelligible. Point to be noted is she was shastra level Samskrtam!! Yes, it is very much true that one who is conversant competent in an Indian language is 50% knowledgeable in Samskrtam. This is the experience of many a learner of Samskrtam- either Samskrita
Bharati way or another.



***Present relevance of the Dead-Alive issue***

Indian youth are running away to other countries because present generation always learnt that all science is Non-Indian origin. There is nothing worth in India. It is fact for them because they least know about Samskrtam. All Indian knowledge is preserved in language who belonged to her from time immemorial. The thinking, the vision, the content of those precious texts have been eclipsed because of Mecauley education system. And when Samskrtam was tried to make academic in modern ways, she suffered a death blow. So it becomes an issue of importance that not only that Samskrtam is alive, but she owns worthy a literature to make the whole world proud. One Bhagavadgita, one Ramayana can change the present want-of-peace, unrestful situation and ancient texts contain answers to many a problem of the world. Ayurevda, yoga, jyotisha are not merely bookish things, but they are applied sciences, tried, tested and proved by time immemorial. Every Samskrtam scholar is aware of these issues which need no elaboration. Calling one sweet, scholar-feeding and divine language as dead has resulted in great devastating state of lack of pride in youth and we are losing them. Many Science graduates, technology people, and modern sciences stalwarts are themselves turning to Samskrtam, looking for answers to their inquisitions. If Samskrtam remains sealed “dead” then not much work will be done with her and precious treasure of knowledge (still remaining in the unedited manuscripts) will always wait for discoverers.

******

***A case in contrast-***

Now coming to dead language definition, yes, it is completely applicable to Prakrit. Because lately I never heard anyone speaking, writing books or creating a flowy speech in Prakrit, (not even Paisachi, Magadhi Pali). (Pardon if I am missing something here. Let me know if anyone heard of it). So she may be a language being studied as a dead language and the definition completely applies to her.



That’s why I was puzzled, Keeping aside census datas, politics, efforts of revivals etc., I did not understand how a dead-language definition applies to Samskrtam. Without making the issue further complicated, may be the definition needs a re-consideration when it comes to Samskrtam?

Thankyou.
