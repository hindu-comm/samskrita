The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one language becomes bilingual in another language, and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original (or heritage) language.  

  
If we go by the above definition Sanskrit is not completely dead  
  
By contrast to an extinct language which no longer has any speakers, a dead language may remain in use for scientific, legal, or ecclesiastical functions. Old Church Slavonic, Avestan, Coptic, Biblical Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Ge'ez, Ardhamagadhi, Pali, Sanskrit and Latin are among the many dead languages used as sacred languages.  
  
A dead language is a language which is no longer learned as a native language. Some well known examples of dead languages include Coptic, Ancient Greek, Latin, and Sanskirt, although there are numerous other dead languages from regions around the world, including huge numbers of Native American languages which died out with European colonialism. Some dead languages are topics of study because of their cultural, linguistic, or social importance, and some dead languages actually have numbers of speakers which exceed those of modern or living languages, languages which are learned as native tongues.  

So what is language death? In the simplest terms, a dead language is one that is still used in specific contexts but does not have native speakers. Contrast this with so-called living languages, which continue to grow and evolve due in large part to the number of people using them in everyday speech. Dead languages, therefore, have not completely disappeared. They’ve just become linguistically inert — dead in the water, so to speak.

I think this is what Dr. Bhat said
