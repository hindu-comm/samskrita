Again - you are ignoring the point made about examples to illustrate Samskrit being used by ordinary folk, and not just by poets.

I didn't talk about heritage. My limited point was about Samskrit and it's use as a language.  

Isn't it the parent's prerogative to educate their children in the best way they see? And where is this outrage of yours when it comes to parents who are "forcing" children to learn English "in an artificial way"? The thing about goose and gander is that they are both geese.

How is this related to what I was saying? Random wiki quote?!

Mahabhashya as subhashita? I don't know what that's supposed to mean.  

Taken literally, what you said previously does not make sense.

So now I see a shift from 'native speakers' or 'mother tongue' to "own natural mother tongue". What next? "Really own, not yours, only my mother tongue?" :)  

At any rate, last time I checked, India was a free country - relatively speaking. Parents were free to choose how to educate their kids.  

I have been passionately dispassionate in making my points. Although it is difficult to resist being dispassionately passionate when arguments are ignored!

I am reminded of the quote, with one leg on the past, and another leg on the future, .... you know the rest!  

Listen, I am not questioning anyone's commitment to Samskrit. And of course, I recognize that many, including you, want good things for Samskrit. So I see no need to belabor that point.
