1. Is it not high time academicians such as linguists pondered over the question of why there is a resistance to the use of terms such as “dead language” in reference to languages such as Sanskrit? Is not this resistance based on the fact that all the languages that are brought under the category of ‘dead language’ do not possess the same characteristics and the users of this term are able to see that the term ‘dead language’ is not able to communicate the idea that Sanskrit has many distinct features vis-à-vis the other similar languages which have very few or no mother tongue speakers ?



2. The statements such as "most observers would agree that, in some crucial way, Sanskrit is dead" by western scholars such as Sheldon Pollock (2001)(["The Death of Sanskrit"](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pollock/sks/papers/death_of_sanskrit.pdf), *Comparative Studies in Society and History* **43** (2): 392–426, [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier "Digital object identifier")) were contested by western scholars only.



Hannender (2002), for example, contests Pollock's statement by saying,



"On a more public level the statement that Sanskrit is a dead language is misleading, for Sanskrit is quite obviously not as dead as other dead languages and the fact that it is spoken, written and read will probably convince most people that it cannot be a dead language in the most common usage of the term. Pollock’s notion of the “death of Sanskrit” remains in this unclear realm between academia and public opinion when he says that “most observers would agree that, in some crucial way, Sanskrit is dead”?( "On "The Death of Sanskrit", *Indo-Iranian Journal* **45** (4): 293–310(18)),



Hatcher, Brian A. (2007) too contests Pollock's idea in ["Sanskrit and the morning after"](http://ier.sagepub.com/content/44/3/333.abstract), *Indian Economic & Social History Review* **44** (3): 333–361.



3. Hannender's words, "Sanskrit is quite obviously not as dead as other dead languages " shows that it is this distinction of Sanskrit in comparison to theother languages that are declared as 'dead' that makes most people rebel against the characterization of Sanskrit as a 'dead language' .



4. The term 'dead language' and its definition in some books of Linguistics are not so sacrosanct and unalterable that the term and its textbook definition need to be applied to Sanskrit and Sanskrit should be called a 'dead language' under that definition.



5. The contemporary state of Latin and the contemporary state of Sanskrit, though appear to havesome similarities that prompt scholars to group the two languages under one category,in fact havemany differences. Hence even if Latin is accepted as a 'dead language' by the experts in that language for any reason(s), Sanskrit need not be accepted as a 'dead language' for those reasons.



6. It should be noted that the call for rejecting the characterization of Sanskrit as a 'dead language' is not an emotional call but a well reasoned out academic call for a more meticulous comparative study of languages which are presently grouped under the same category without such keen analysis.



7. It will be more fruitful and useful in this regard to contribute information on how the creative works in Sanskrit continued , in fact, more vigorously during the more recent centuries (post 16th ) , in the fields of aarthika side of vyaakaraNa and the prakriyaa side of the same, in the fields of alankaara such as new theories of Chamatkara, new concepts of Naayikaa-bhedas, naayakabhedas etc. emerged, new creative works at least in the form of translations of vernacular poetry new play-works (such as vyaayogas and bhaaNas), new Vedanta works such as Achala Vedanta , later Gaudeeya VaishNava works etc. , came out without the assumed interruption found in the analysis of scholars such as Sheldon Pollock. I request scholars in this list contribute allsuch information at their disposal, if necessary, in a different thread.



8. That way we can reassure to ourselves that groups such as BVP or Samskritaare not post-mortem study groups.

Nagaraj
