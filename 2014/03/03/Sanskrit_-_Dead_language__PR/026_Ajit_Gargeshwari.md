Will this make Sanskrit a native language as a linguistic entity or are we reviving a dead language artificially? Even now there are many speakers in Middle English or old English who use and understand them
Many may write and start speaking Latin artificially but it is never natural. Sanskrit was never a mother tongue for any one now and was not so the past. It might become artificially in the future as you have indicated. Thanks for allowing me to express a view on this topic
