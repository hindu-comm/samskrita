I am sure you will agree that simply repeating a point does not make it true - especially when presented with a counter-example. In that spirit, would you consider the English-speaking child (from previous email) a native speaker of English? His parents aren't, and neither are people in his circle. If you consider him a native speaker of English, on what basis do you exclude a similar child who grow up with Samskrit from his childhood?  
  

I am not proposing to teach anyone anything - all I am saying is that if some parents want to educate their children in a particular way (and I say this with no personal stake in this matter) - they should be free to do so without a sort of critical outrage.  
  

As you said, please read the thread - I did not quote census figures. In fact, I set them aside.  
  

I know quite a few ordinary folk with who are perfectly able to speak in Samskrit fluently and they have been doing so for a long time - some from prepubescent times. And our conversation is hardly ever about glorious heritage or whatever. This is not to say that Samskrit today is widely spoken. It is not. So what? Does a Tulu speaker stop speaking Tulu becomes 98.2% of the country does not understand his/her Tulu? (I just made up that number to make a larger point).  

  

Some people want to keep Samskrit reserved for certain things they consider sacred, and that's their prerogative. Just as some people thought the idea of an opera in English was ludicrous. Operas were meant to be in Italian or such. But languages belong to people who use them. Rest is well, besides the point.  
  
  

This will probably be my last post on this thread for the next couple of days at least. I have said what I have wanted to say in reaction to the discussion so far. Unless there is anything significantly new, I'll step off this thread.
