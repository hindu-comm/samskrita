For Sanskrit is taught as a ‘Dead language’ which is defined as a ‘ language no longer spoken by living people and in circulation in society’ (!) .   
  

Please see the definition of Dead Language below:

To be frank, I do not know whther such book or any article was published, or available online. Just google and you will get some articles,

 

  

  

  

If you are not specifically on



by any Samskrtam scholars

you can consider my reply which draws from western dictionaries and linguists and not by samskrutam scholars.Otherwise, you may simply ignore the following replies by me, like those by western scholars. Sorry I did not notice the above specific point in your request.

  

  
Was looking for something where the issue is systematically, academically and point-wise way analysed in these lines-  
  

> 1. What is a dead language?.

  



A language, such as Latin, that is no longer learned as a native language by a speech community.

  

[/dead+language](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dead+language)  

  
  
A dead language is called as such, where there are no native speakers of the language. And not any language spoken by dead languages or could not be spoken by living languages. Any living human being can speak any language either it is classified as dead or living, by special training as he is endowed with articulatory organs of speech unlike animals. This is what is meant by dead language, that is not spoken by any living people as the native speakers. (i.e.) note the usage of "native speakers" and not those who are capable of speaking any language with articulatory facility.  
We generally call as mother toungue in general usage.

  

Definition:

 Language Death:

  

  

A linguistic term for the end or extinction of a language.  
  
Distinctions are commonly drawn between an endangered language (one with few or no children learning the language) and an extinct language (one in which the last native speaker has died).  
  
Definition given by richard.

Native Speaker:  

  
Definition:  
  
A speaker who uses a first language or mother tongue.  
  
"A child may be a native speaker of more than one language as long as the acquisition process starts early and necessarily prepuberty. After puberty (Felix, 1987), it becomes difficult--not impossible, but very difficult (Birdsong, 1992)--to become a native speaker."

> 2\. What are the basic criteria for a dead language?

  

I had already explained in short in the above paragraph and the difference between a living language and dead language.  
In contrast with living language, which is the native speakers are living, it is called living language and the language the native speakers are no more living, is called dead language, precisely.  
And not the dead people are speaking, is a dead language. There is a language called पैशाची which is said to be spoken by पिशाच-s and there is a literature also. The story by गुणाढ्य was written in पैशाची language according to legends.  
  
Please read the above book on Language Death  
  

and also speech community:

Note the use of native speakers and speech community in the field of Language Study and Linguistic Study:

The Hebrew



language was once a dead language and it is said that the Hebrew people, (in the



early

 1

9th century) made it a living language, as the native language by their effort

 which is called Modern Hebrew

.  
  

[Modern_Hebrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew)  
  
Just like Samskritabharati workers  
are trying today for Sanskrit. The difference is that Hebrew people were limited in population and without caste and creed as in India today. Hence it was possible with little effort. The case of Sanskrit is quite different and India is the 2nd largest country in population, and contains more than 17 languages based on which the country is divided even though India is one country politically and many other unlisted spoken languages only with oral literature, up to 371 languages.  
And Sanskrit was used as priestly language for many centuries, like Hebrew  
and the reviving efforts are recent ones in many corners and with different interests as yu have raised in your next question. Latin also a priestly language, no more spoken, while its derivative languages like French, Italian etc. are formed as spoken forms of the independent European Countries where they are the national languages, unlike India, which contains innumerable languages as already noted above. Hence reviving effort of Latin is also on the swing, see:  
  

Contemporary_Latin

  
  
Yet it is still classified as Dead Language

 in comparative linguistics as it simultaneously continues as the language for church services, in spite of the users of today.

  
  
  

> 4\. Samskrtam status, standards and role as a language in modern world > context..

  
  

This is discussed in many forums with similar interests in reviving Sanskrit and no such effect in real life, like finding technical terms for English and Latin technical and Scientific words and finding Vedic Science to be utilized in modern world of other. But without users of such technically coined terms, in research projects, it is equal to be a dead list of words or any group of users may know who do not do any scientific research and write in Scientific language. If you mean by modern world, the scientific renaiscance period through Sanskrit or Sanskritising the Indian and World population, make use of Samskrtam to their daily needs.  
Depends on your intensity of emotions and aspiration to use it as a language in modern context and its practicability.

  
  


> 5. Indian traditional approach on this issue vs non-Indian standing.

  
  

Indian tradition had no doubt as such whether Sanskrit is a dead language or living language. They used it for serving their needs, learning Literature and different Shastra-s, without spending much time on such issues. Westernal Scholars who had a wider knowledge of languages of the world, in addition to Sanskrit, (with which they came familiar only after colonilization) became interested and engaged in Comparative Linguistics, and were the first to classify the languages of the world as Living and Dead, and as they were introduced, samskrutam was no more a living language in the strictest sense of the definition of the classification, and even then they were attracted to study its literature. That is how we have Sacred Texts of the East in 50 volumes, as a testimony to their intensity of interest. That doesn't mean Indian Scholars never studied Samskrutam before the western Indologists engaged themselves in the study.

  
  
  
  

> 6. Special condition of Samskrtam  
> Or what lines one should think and approach on this issue?

  
  

Answer to this depends on the inclination of the person and his choice. One can chose any approach and free to think independently and arrive at a conclusion.

  



  

> Is it always to be divided between indifferent non-samskrtam and > emotional samskrtam standards..?

  
  

You may explain this point with sufficient grounds. What I have written in the earlier paragraphs, you can look into any book on Historical Linguistics or Comparative Linguistics which deal with the topic of dead and living languages. I just wrote from my memory of reading them in the books I refered for Historical Linguistics  
, some links I have given.  
Or one may despise and reject or replace with his effort, the Indian counter arguments and books to counter the assumptions and hypothesis, (than dedication to

 learning

Sanskrit as an ancient language and literature preserving its culture).  
  

Hope others will have their answers on these points.
