Namaste

*For Sanskrit is taught as a ‘Dead language’ which is defined as a ‘ language no longer spoken by living people and in circulation in society’ (!) . *  

  

Apart from discussions, opinions, points made individually in different contexts, ***is there a full-fledged paper/article/book/seminar*** where this issue has been ***academically dealt*** by any Samskrtam scholars? (Searched BVP and samskrita groups for the points-)  

Was looking for something where the issue is ***systematically, academically and point-wise way analysed*** in these lines-

1\. What is a dead language?

2\. What are the basic criteria for a dead language?

3\. Samskrtam vis a vis other dead languages of the world

4\. Samskrtam status, standards and role as a language in modern world context..

5\. Indian traditional approach on this issue vs non-Indian standing.

6\. Special condition of Samskrtam

Or what lines one should think and approach on this issue? Is it always to be divided between indifferent non-samskrtam and emotional samskrtam standards..?
