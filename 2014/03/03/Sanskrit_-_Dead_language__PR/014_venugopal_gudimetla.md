Dear Sri Ajit ji,  
  
Not so fast. Census shows that there are native Sanskrit speakers. Whether they adopted it as mother tongue or not or whether it is indeed their mother tongue is debatable, doesnt mean you know for sure that you can brush it aside just with opinions. Sir, secondly, Linguistics is not a science that you can lump with tested models what ever you mean by that, no idea what the role models have in deciding whether Sanskrit is a mother tongue or not. I do know what census is sir, it has nothing to do with collecting basic information, raw data is raw data, prior to application of any statistical tools, so what is your point?  
  
Just because you didn't hear of anyone mentioning Sanskrit as their mother tongue doesn't mean they dont exist.  
  
Regards,  
Venu
