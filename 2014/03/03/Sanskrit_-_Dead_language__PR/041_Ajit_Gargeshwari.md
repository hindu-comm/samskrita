 I have already expressed my desire to be out of this discussion as I have clearly said what i needed to covey. Yet you keep poking me. I never mentioned any ones mother being insulted here. If you are an emotional person how will it change facts? Please leave out rehoteric and come up with some good points i may then respond.

 Don't prattle without understanding what I said. Many who participated in this discussion are neither Linguists, Sanskritists or Indologists including me but I know linguistics well. You may heard about census report but have ever heard Linguistic Survey of India?. PLSI as a nation wide survey is being carried out by members of respective communities, writers, cultural activists, scholars of intangible heritage, practitioners of oral arts and traditions, responsible citizens interested in working out alternate ways of development and scholars who believe in maintaining organic links between scholarship and the social context. According to them the number of Sanskrit speakers or people who wrongly claim Sanskrit as their mother tongue their numbers have increased ever since a politically motivated survey and census report was circulated

The discussion was not about whether Sanskrit is artificial language or not That can be discussed in a separate thread.

But all I know it is an artificial language so whats new?  

Mahabhashya was quoted in this context please read its message well. A linguistic entity can either be a living or dead language. An artificial language without it ever being a mother tongue of any can still be an age old language because of its usage in sacred and religious acts and purposes. May be if you make a loose definition of mother tongue your views fit in.

You have the right to consider and keep a view point its your choice and to express my views is my choice.
