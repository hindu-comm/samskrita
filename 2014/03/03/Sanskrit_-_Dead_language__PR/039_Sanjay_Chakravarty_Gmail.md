Ajitji,



I couldn’t help jumping into the debate. I feel as if my mother is being insulted.



Going by the definition of language death that you have mentioned



In linguistics, **language death** (also **language extinction**, **linguistic extinction** or **linguicide**, and rarely also **glottophagy**) is a process that affects speech communities where the level of linguistic competence that speakers possess of a given language variety is decreased, eventually resulting in no native or fluent speakers of the variety.



I think I see enough linguistic competence amongst the people on this list. They are able to converse in Sanskrit amongst themselves, and can do so orally if given a chance. Perhaps just 300 people, still a community. Artificial, maybe, still a community which wants to preserve the language as it has been. Period. संस्कृतम् अमृतम् चिरंतरमेव.



Was Sanskrit ever a living language? Instead of believing the western scholars, just as Nareshji says, I am more inclined to think by logic. That a language cannot survive for 5000 years without being part and parcel of everyday life. And that can be only when it is spoken everyday. If we say, it was an elitist language like English, where the mother tongue is something else but children are brought up in English today, well even English, to be living, has to be the mother tongue of some race. An elitist language cannot drop from the sky as one which belongs to no race on earth. Therefore, Sanskrit had to be the mother tongue of some race. If not in Bharat, whose mother tongue could it have been?



Languages metamorphose in 500 years. The English of 16^(th) century, as Nareshji says, is not the English of today. What makes us think that Sanskrit survived for millennia just by being an elitist language? I really like Nareshji’s points here. We cannot go back in history, so pratyaksha pramana is not there. Shall we ignore the anumana as well?



As I write, I also read your email signature, taken from the Geeta. It can equally well describe the Sanskrit language. अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणः



Warm Regards

Sanjay
