Argument so far just to summarize:  
1. For a language to be considered living and in constant use, there have to be native speakers whose mother tongue is that language as the first language, language of daily use.  
2. Esteemed members like Phaniapard ji, Murthy ji, Ramakrishnan ji have provided GoI census data and other relevant data to say that there is considerable population that claims Sanskritam as their mother tongue.  
3. Esteemed members like hnbhat ji, Ajit ji say that these are mere speakers but not those whose mother tongue is Samskritam.  
  
Now I understand that hnbhat ji is eminent and respected Sanskritam scholar. But given the data that there could be genuine speakers as listed in census whose mother tongue is Samskritam, claiming that it is false, begs to be proved thus. Since scholarly arguments need to be proved through one's data, I beg nhbhat ji to prove that of the thousands of Samskritam speakers all are lying that their mother tongue is not Samskritam, no sizeable population exists whose native language is Smaskritam. Definition and concepts are alright, but all arguments need to be supported through either logic or through data. Just quoting Mahabhshyam may not be sufficient. How does one know that of the thousands of Samskritam speakers, none exist whose mother tongue is also Samskritam? just because you said so and think so? do you think that is good enough sir? facts need to be backed with data, if not, the answer is uncertain or not known.
