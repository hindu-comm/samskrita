Samskrtam comes to Brahmanas natural way because they are related more and connected more to it through their rituals. Anything else can die easily, but not their rituals- fortunately. So many of the pooja, mantras are in that *Divine* language. They would naturally want to know the meaning,. and there is nothing wrong in it.

Coming to Devabhasha- it is language "for" the gods.. not just "of" the gods., if that word ever would describe her. (And why feel bad using devabhasha-? In fact we should be proudly speaking her.)

But it is not the actual intended sense of that word- deva-bhasha means a language that has divine element in her!! Her construction, her Grammar, her sciences are all inspired from the Divine. All sounds bear an energy and they are perfected in Samskrtam!! That's how Samskrtam words give power to the speakers. Each letter bears the power of a mantra if used properly..! That is why chanting some shlokas even will enhance brain cells for more memory and understanding powers. The language helps you penetrate deeper into your brains' unexplored areas even without your knowledge. Unfortunately there is no study taken up anywhere in these lines!! It is done for Music and other areas, but not Samskrtam because of these misconceptions and wrong notions "deliberately" induced into the mind of innocent non-brahmana Indians!! (Please note there is an issue called "colonizing" if you are familiar with that term!)

No body ever stopped anyone from learning. It was "natural" that others stayed away because there was nothing that connected them to Samskrtam or Shastras in their lives. We all know that our life styles are different. We have many disparities - and we are bound to accept. Noone created them. They are there since beginning of this earth- everywhere- where there are no brahmanas also!!

People fought for Vedas being kept away from them!! Now they are on roads. How many buy them? How many read them? Out of that how many understand them?

Pardon, please. But now things have changed. Please do not raise irrelevant issues here! Misconceptions can be there about anything and everything when they are deliberately introduced with missionary zeal by some people! I pray- do not fall prey to them.
