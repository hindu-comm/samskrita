Dear Learrned Scholar  

Pranaam  
  

Its easy to get rid from the samshay by asking solution for particular issue but while resolving any issue, samshay wont be resolved completely. For that Jnan is necessary. Even Lord Krishhna says same thing in Gita:  
  
अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति।  
  
नायं लोकोऽस्ति न परो न सुखं संशयात्मनः।।4.40।।  
  

and then he resolve the issue by giving a solution:  
  
तस्मादज्ञानसंभूतं हृत्स्थं ज्ञानासिनाऽऽत्मनः।  
  
छित्त्वैनं संशयं योगमातिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ भारत।।4.42।।  
  

Theregore I request you all to gether proper knowledge and then there will be no sanshay.  
  

Regards  
  
Ashish Sharma
