It is true that even the illiterate folks compose songs rapidly and that is of various rhythms in which

increasing or decreasing the number of letters is permissible because of contraction or expansion in singing. Sometimes we can observe that even small boys can imitate wellknownsongs , compose new songs with their own wordings(for pleasure). That is possible because in the main set of rhythm, so many varieties of tempos and sub-tempos are allowed .

They can not do the same with metres like Shardulavikridita, Sragdharaa, Maalinii, Shaalinee etc.. that do not tolerate this kind of freedom.

By practice, some poets become aashu-kavis. Their practice does requirepaperwork. Of course, reading or listening the poems of other poets is essential. Anybody can create verses rapidly without need of writing when Aashukavitva state is reached. Before that, practice of
composing verses in writing is a must.

Chando-gati is of (verse)literature while Taala-gati is of music. Even though both may touch mutually in some points, basically they are different. Wordings(In Samskrta it is called Vaak) are major concern in the first, while, letters that to be sung(Geya in Samskrta) is focal point in the second .

I am not arguing that Taalagati is easier than Chandogati. (Since I experimented withboth, I do know that some times both Chandogati and Taalagati are challenging) What I am saying is, for some, practicing of composing songs (in the initial stage) may not require paper work, but that is not true for practicing of composing verses in metres like Sragdharaa etc…

  

That an Aushukavi can dictate the verses rapidly composed by him(without help of pen/sheet of paper) to a person is different matter.
