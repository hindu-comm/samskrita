I think writing is not a necessary tool for composing poetry and Valmiki didn't find a pen and paper to compose his first verse

  

मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः।

  

which is said to be spontaneous creation of the first poet and the first poem flown at the sight of the killing of the Krauncha birds by a hunter. If you believe this story as handed over by tradition, it is no wonder that poets need not writing material to write down

  

क्रौञ्चद्वन्द्ववियोगोत्थःशोकः श्लोकत्वमागतः .. ५.. विविधवाच्यवाचकरचनाप्रपञ्चचारुणः काव्यस्य स एवार्थः सारभूतः . चादिकवेर्वाल्मीकेः निहतसहचरीविरहकातर- क्रौञ्चाक्रन्दजनितः शोक एव श्लोकतया परिणतः . शोको हि करुणस्थायिभावः .

  

according to the writer of Dhvanyaloka.

Recording the voice was not made in writing for the Veda's as you have suggested and only for the composition it is not necessary that it should be written down first.

  

The sages or disciplines may write down or they could memorize the verses. The first students were Kusha and Lava who were taught the composition of Valmiki and popularized by singing aloud.

  

The same is true of Veda-s as they are handed over to the disciples orally. If you believe history, writing was a later invention in the language system and first became speech. And many languages which do not have their own scripts, have their own oral literature which were never put into writing and yet handed down by tradition. This is what I know about language and literature and writing.

  

In other words, writing is not at all a necessary for the composition of literature, in which case you cannot have any literature for the languages which do not have any script. On the other hand, writing is a tool to record the compositions in one or other form using any script available for the users of the poetry in permanent materials preserved for next generations.
