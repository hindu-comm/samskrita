Dhanyavaadah, Mahodaya.

  

Thanks for your response and suggestions.



Regarding the topic of written vs oral:

\(1\) If it is true that there was no written tradition initially, it is amazing to imagine how the entire corpus of work such as vedas, brahmana, etc were conceived/formulated without writing them down. So, was Astadhyayi also composed without writing it down? (by Panini)...what about Ramayana?....If this is true, I find all this amongst the most'amazing intellectual feats' of mankind.

\(2\) Another point is, when the work has, say, 2000 verses, if you do not write it down, how do you remember them all, in the exact order, the exact words, letters, etc.??

  

Kindly let me know your thoughts...



Regards,
