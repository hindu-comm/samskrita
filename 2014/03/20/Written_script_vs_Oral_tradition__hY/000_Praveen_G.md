Namaste,

  

I have read in multiple books that in Sanskrit, the written script came much later, and initially it was a completely oral, unwritten language. I had a question about this: If a poet wanted to compose a Kavya, if there was no written script, how could they compose the Kavya in their mind such that it follows the meter? in my humble opinion, without writing it down, you cannot put down the 'Guru' and 'Laghu', and therefore cannot know the pattern of the meter (Aarya, Mandaakranta, etc...).

So, is this theory of 'no written script' flawed? or, am I missing something here?

  

Requesting your esteemed opinions/comments.

  

Dhanyavada,

  

Praveen.
