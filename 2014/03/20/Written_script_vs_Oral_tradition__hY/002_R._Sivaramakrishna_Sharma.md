As Murthyjee rightly points out, Kavis do not 'write down' their compositions.  
  
To further clarify, there are two types of poets, Sahaja-Kavi's and Kritrima-kavis. Sahaja-Kavis have the extraordinary ability to compose metrical verses without resorting to pre-compiling thoughts, arranging of words/syllables etc. Whatever flows out of them is metrical. For example Valmiki etc.  
  
Kritrima Kavis on the other hand think, albeit a little to do their compositions, select words etc.  
  
And as for those who pen their compositions, mark the laghu gurus etc. they are really not Kavis, for if a person cannot visualize the shabda and the nada arising, he cannot be considered a "real" Kavi.  
  
A fine example of a Sahaja-Kriti in would be Vedanta Desikacharya's Paduka Sahasram comprising of 1000 verses composed in mere 4 yamas (equivalent to approximately 12 hours). That goes without saying, Valmiki Ramayana; when Valmiki's curse on the Nishadha was itself in Anushtup. Did Valmiki pre-contemplate the laghu and guru's, the matras etc. before uttering the curse ? Did He ever intend of uttering a curse in metre ?
