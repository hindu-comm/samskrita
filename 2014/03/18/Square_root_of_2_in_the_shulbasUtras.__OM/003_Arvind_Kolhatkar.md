I am reminded of a documentary I had once seen, showing how the ancient people of Britain might have brought the Stonehenge stones from quarries located a few hundred kilometers away and erected them to create the Stonehenge marvel. ErectingStonehengetoday would be veryeasy, with the help of modern transport, mighty cranes and powerful barges. Yet it is interesting to study how the ancients built Stonehenge with the very primitive tools at their disposal.

  

Finding square-root of any number is child's play today when you have a pocket calculator in your hand. Yet, how the ShulbasUtrakaras solved this problem when they had no aid at their disposal at all - the zero-based place-value system and basic arithmetical operations were still a few centuries away - is something worth studying for its own sake.
