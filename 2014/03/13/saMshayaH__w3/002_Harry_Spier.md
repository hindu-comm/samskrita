Apte uses गंगा in his dictionary but Monier-Williams uses गङ्गा in his.

If you look at page v of the introduction to Apte's Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary he explains the "convenience for printing" reason he deciding in his dictionaries to use anusvAra instead of the class nasal.

He writes in his "Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary page v:  
"As in the English-Sanskrit Dictionary, I have here throughout used the anusvAra instead of the nasals, (e.g. anga or santApa is written not as अङ्ग , सन्ताप but as अंग ,संताप ), which practice, whatever may be said with regard to its correctness, is very convenient for purposes of printing.

He writes in his English-Sanskrit dictionary introduction page ix:  
"With regard to the method of writing the Sanskrit equivalents, an objection might possibly be raised. Throughout the work the usual practice of representing every anusvAra in the body of a word by its corresponding nasals has been rejected and the anusvAra sign is invariably used, where usually a nasal would stand. I have not been able to understand the principle on which scholars reject this system and betake themselves solely to the other; though the anusvAra system is most convenient in printing, and occasionally saves much misunderstanding. Besides, it is a practice generally followed in our old Manuscripts, and is sanctioned by Panini as being optional. For these reasons I have scrupulously followed it in this Dictionary, but more especially because it is very convenient in printing."
