Respected scholastic members,

  

I am ignorant of grammar rules.

  

I only remember the Slesha  

  

सर्वदोमाधव:पायात् स: योगंगामधीधरत्  

  

which praises bothमाधव: and उमाधव:. This is impossible if anuswara is not used for Ganga. Further Panini is applicable to speech and not to writing.

  

Pranams

R Subrabhmanian
