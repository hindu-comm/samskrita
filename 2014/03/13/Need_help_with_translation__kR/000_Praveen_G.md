Namaste,

  

I joined this group today. I am so happy that I found it. As a beginner to learning Samskritam, I am amazed at the knowledge of you all.

I had a humble request: in the course of my learning (for the Parichaya level of Samskrita Bharati), I wondered how these sentences can be written in Samskritam:

  

Using the word 'Parnam' for 'leaf', how do we translate the following:

  

'I saw a fallen leaf'

'I saw a falling leaf'

  

'I see a fallen leaf'

'I see a falling leaf'

  

'I will see a fallen leaf'

'I will see a falling leaf'

  

Thanking you in advance,

  

Praveen.
