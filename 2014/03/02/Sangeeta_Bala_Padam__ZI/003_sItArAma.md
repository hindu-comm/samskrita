Dr. Bhat,  
Thanks for your prompt reply, we have these MP3 audios, we are looking for written text.  

In spoken its said "Bala Padam" so commonly that until you pointed it out it did not occur to us that the correct way to saying it would be Bala Patham = Lessons for beginners.  
  

Thanks for sharing the above link  

regards  

Raama
