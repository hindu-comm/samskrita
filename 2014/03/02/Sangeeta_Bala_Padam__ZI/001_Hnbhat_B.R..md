I don't know of any such text. But the Sangeetha Balapatham class is taken by Smt. Vedavalli and it is available for listening in Music India online:

  

<http://mio.to/album/10-classical_carnatic_vocal/30671-Sangitha_Bala_Padam/#/album/10-classical_carnatic_vocal/30671-Sangitha_Bala_Padam/>  

  

in two parts.

  

After that you can learn the other parts if you want to learn Carnatic Music Lessons by listening to audio Cassets. If u want to learn, I can share the complete set in mp3 form of the series of teaching.

  

I don't think you can learn by reading the books.
