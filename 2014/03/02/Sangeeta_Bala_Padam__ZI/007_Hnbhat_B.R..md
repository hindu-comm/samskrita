It is only natural to Tamil. In प्राकृत languages, ठ becomes ढ, but Tamil has got in its alphabet, only the first of the वर्ग letters, पाढ is பாடம் but pronounced as pāḍham which is common to Malayalam pronounciation also, for ठ written, but pronounced as ढ. In Prakrit languages, using Devanagari script, it is always written as पाढ. "ठो ढः" प्राकृतप्रकाशः (२।२४) is the general rule for Prakrit conversion of Sanskrit words.
