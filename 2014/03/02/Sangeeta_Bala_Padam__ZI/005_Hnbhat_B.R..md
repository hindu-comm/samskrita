He was looking for the text of of the audio lessons of Smt. Vedavalli, he is having, with the title "Sangitha Bala Padam Music Lessons" which he could not understand the word "padam". So I just explained is as the correct word *balapaatham*in Sanskrit as lessons for the beginners (Beginers' lessons) the correct word in Sanskrit.

  

He is not in need of any other Beginner Lessons in Music, but only wanted to know the correct word in Sanskrit. Here is already having the cassets and got the text also which also in Tamil.
