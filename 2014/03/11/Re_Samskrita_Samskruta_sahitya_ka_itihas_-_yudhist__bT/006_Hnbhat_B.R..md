Very good reply. Now we have to ask the authorities, who prepared the syllabus or anyone who has passed the Examination with the prescribed syllabus. How they learned the Sahithya Shastra Ka Itihas. Any of the members who have passed the examination may answer also if they read the textbook by Yudhishthir Mimamsak prescribed for them.
