Dr Bhat,

Someone told me the name of the book is "Samskrit sahitya ka Itihas"

I started looking for it and could not find any, so I asked the group. In reply to my question I got Anunadji's reply saying that it correct name could be SanskritVyakarana Shastra ka Itihas.

I also confirm this through Ramlal Kapoor catalog.



It was mistake on my part to ask the question here based on what I learned from a friend.



The correct name is "Sanskrit Vyakarana Shastra ka Itihas "



Regards

Raama
