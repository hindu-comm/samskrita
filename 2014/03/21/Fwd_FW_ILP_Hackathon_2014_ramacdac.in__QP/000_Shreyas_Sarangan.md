ILP Hackathon

*What is ILP Hackathon?*

ILP stands for **Indic Language Processing**. ILP Hackathon a fun two-day, focused group-programming event to jump-start the creation of useful tools for processing Indian languages, especially Samskrit, using available computing technology. The objective is to kindle interest in this fertile area of innovation among the programming-savvy youth to benefit the Indian community and themselves both intellectually and culturally.

A focussed group effort such as a hackathon always produces something useful quickly, provides a much faster learning curve to its participants, and builds excellent teams.

*Which Projects?*

1.  Speech-to-text converter for Samskrit via sound segmentation at
    akshara-level. 2.  Text-to-speech synthesizer for Samskrit shlokas and prose: Unicode
    text to its spoken rendering in your favorite voice.

*When?*

-   March 22, 23 2014 (Saturday and Sunday), 9am to 5pm. Demo at 5-6pm.

*Where (venue)?*

Department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA), IISc Bangalore campus.

*Prerequisites:*

-   A laptop with Linux and Windows installed (preferably Ubuntu),
    audacity software. Wi Fi Internet will be provided. -   Proficiency in a modern scripting language (Perl or Python) and
    Java/C++. -   Basic knowledge of Indian alphabet (devanagari). -   Optional: Hands-on experience with M/c learning techniques and tools
    like Matlab or R. -   Optional: Speech processing expertise a big help. -   Optional: Android app development experience will enable developing
    a cool phone app.

*How to Register?*

**Send an email by 2pm on Friday Mar 21, 2014**to the following people. Only the first 6 people with the best available skills will be accepted to ensure good productivity. Youâ€™ll be notified by 9pm. If accepted, show up at the venue by 8.30am for orientation, and the fun begins.

-   **Prof. Gopinath**, IISc CSA dept (**[go...@csa.iisc.ernet.in]()**),

&nbsp;

-   **Sai Susarla**, NetApp (***[sai.s...@gmail.com]()***,
    [99020-39123](tel:99020-39123)) -   **Sri P. Ramanujan**, Assoc. Director, CDAC, Samskrit scholar
    (**[ra...@cdac.in]()**)

*Logistics:*

-   Juices and snacks served, will go out for lunch together (self-paid) -   Access to a networked Linux server with Internet access provided by
    IISc.

*Why ILP? Why Samskrit?*

Despite significant advances in computer-assisted natural language processing of English and other languages, the technology for Indian language processing has not matured due to lack of adequate attention by the scientific community. Several tools and methods have been developed for various aspects of handling Indian languages in various research institutes in India and elsewhere, including OCR, sentence parsing, conjunct analysis etc. But their unavailability and lack of interoperability in a reusable framework severely inhibits their mainstream use and further enhancement by the community. The dwindling number of scholars in Indian traditional shaastras is a looming threat to preserving and enhancing precious traditional knowledge in areas such as Ayurveda, eco-sciences and naturopathy. Samskrit is undoubtedly the key to this knowledge, and is highly amenable to automated processing due to its regular structure. Most Indian languages share the tech-friendly traits of Samskrit and hence can benefit from these processing tools as well.

The availability of reusable tools and technologies for large-scale automated processing of Samskrit and other Indian language texts has the following benefits:

-   it **democratizes access**to the vast Indian knowledge base by
    employing the latest in information technology to lower the barrier
    to self-study significantly. -   it gives **a fillip to widespread comparative study**of and
    research into the vast Indian literature in areas relevant to the
    present day. Govt statistics indicate at least half a million
    unpublished and unscrutinized manuscripts on various secular
    subjects in Indian languages, just in Samskrit. That illustrates the
    scale of the problem. Without modern tools to assist, exploration of
    these texts is a painstakingly slow and error-prone process that
    discourages many otherwise interested students. -   it **opens up a largely unexplored area for innovation in computer
    science**, namely, exploiting the regular structure of Indian
    Samskrit-based natural languages to significantly improve natural
    language processing and its applications in India.
