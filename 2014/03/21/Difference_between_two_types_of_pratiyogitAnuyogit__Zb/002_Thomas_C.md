Thanks for the direction. I really appreciate it.

  

It helps. However, I still find that this doesn't exactly clarify the full range of the use of pratiyogitā and anuyogitā. I find myself asking basic questions like: "In the sentence 'ज्ञानविषयो गटः", why is the प्रतियोगिता 'ज्ञाननिष्ठा', and why is the अनुयोगिता 'गटनिष्ठा'? Is this because in Navyanyāya we can speak of the cognition as resident in the object?That is, the definition of pratiyogin as "पूर्वं योगः समबन्धः विद्यते अस्य" doesn't clarify *why*the construction of'ज्ञानविषयो गटःwithpratiyogitā and anuyogitāis the way it is.

  

Also the commentary definesप्रतियोगिता as विरोधिता, but in the construction ofज्ञानविषयो गटः, there is nothing "opposing". This doesn't make sense to me. Does this definition ofप्रतियोगिता as विरोधिता only apply to cases ofabsence, as in घटाभावस्य घटः प्रतियोगी but not to cases likeज्ञानविषयो गटः?

  

Also the commentary mentions the type of example I am curious about with upamā. The commentary defines प्रतियोगित्वं as वित्तिवेद्यत्वम् . They use the same example I mentioned in my original post (slightly reworded):  यथा चन्द्रवन्मुखमित्यादौ चन्द्रप्रतियोगिकसादृश्याश्रयम् मुखम् इति बोधः . My problem then is thatवित्तिवेद्यत्वम् remains undefined. What isवित्तिवेद्यत्वम् ? I can guess, but still I would like to see what the actual definition is. The definitions given ofpratiyogitā and anuyogitā given in this work still don't make perfect sense in the case ofupamā. My best guess is thatप्रतियोगि is sort of equivalent to निरूपक and अनुयोगिन् is sort of equivalent to आश्रय, but again this is me guessing, and this doesn't exactly fit with the definition "पूर्वं योगः समबन्धः विद्यते अस्य" nor with the definition ofप्रतियोगिता as विरोधिता.

  

Would it be possible for you to give me some additional explanations or the titles of some more basic works that give more definitions and examples? Honestly, the more material I can look at to make sense of this, the better.

  

\*I'm going to post this last part again as aseparatetopic so that it may be more visible for other people who have the same question.

  

Thanks so much, I really appreciate it.
