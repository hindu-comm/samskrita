Hello,

  

May I ask someone's help to explain the difference between the two uses of pratiyogitānuyogitābhāva? Any additional illustrations or expanded constructions with the pariṣkāra method would be most appreciated.

  

I understand the first usage where pratiyogin is translated as "counter-positive". 

  

As in, "yasya abhāvah sa pratiyogī". And "yatra abhāvah sa anuyogī".
To take the example: "ghaṭābhāvavadbhūtalam" ="there is an absence of the pot on the ground/the ground possesses an absence of pot". Here, ghaṭa = pratiyogin; "pot = counter-positive". bhūtala = anuyogin; "ground = substratum". Therefore, "ghaṭe pratiyogitā", and "bhūtale anuyogitā". Then "ghaṭaniṣṭapratiyogitānirūpitānuyogitāśrayambhūtalam" = "the ground is the abode of substratum-ness determined by counterpositive-ness resident in the pot". This is all very clear to me.

  

The second usage, however, is not clear to me; can someone please explain to me the second usage where pratiyogin means "adjunct" (i.e. conditioner/nirūpaka), and anuyogin means "subjunct" (i.e. locus/āśraya)? Again, illustrations and expanded constructions with thewith the pariṣkāra method would be much appreciated. The only description I have been able to find is in Dr. Bimal Krishna Matilal's book "The Navya-Nyāya Doctrine of Negation". This is a wonderful work, however it speaks to an audience familiar with the technical jargon of the western philosophical tradition, which I am not. I am not versed in the symbols and meta-language of Western analytical philosophy; I am trained as a Sanskritist. Unfortunately Dr. Matilal does not give examples from the Sanskrit which I would be able to understand.

  

Also, any references to basicNavya-Nyāya texts and teaching materials where I could further study this and go through additional examples would be most appreciated.

  

I am particularly interested in understanding how this concept ofpratiyogitānuyogitābhāva comes into play inAlaṅkāraśāstra in the definition ofsimile (upamā). Any help here too would be much appreciated.

  

In Nagesha's commentary on Jagannatha Panditaraja's Rasagangadhara, Nagesha puts forward a new definition ofupamā with this concept ofpratiyogitānuyogitābhāva: "yatra candrādyupamānapratiyogikatvasādṛśyānuyogikatvabuddhikṛtah camatkārahtatra upamālaṅkāratvam". I can translate this, but it still doesn't really make sense to me: "where there is aesthetic delight (camatkārah) produced through the cognition which has similarity for itslocus/subjunct and the moon etc. for its conditioner/adjunct". Is this statementelliptical? It seems it must be as there is no mention of the upameya.

  

Any help with all this would be hugely appreciated!

  

Thanks in advance
