This is a place where interesting books from Aurobindo and group are translated into Samskrtam. I saw that even English prose is translated as verse in Samskrtam. in Chintanascha Chidunmeshah. Felt great. So sharing. May Samskrtam learners enjoy reading divine thoughts in divine language. Aurobindo society has been active in promoting Samskrtam language. And I used their Samskrtam beginner's course- "सरल-संस्कृत-सरणिः" in beginning days of my learning. sAvitri is a great work from Aurobindo's pen. For reading it in Samskrtam one needs log in it seems. Worth trying it out.  
Thankyou
