Dear all,

  

I am interested in knowing the exact point of meeting of Karna with Duryodhana. Under what circumstances did Duryodhana made him the king of Anga desha? Is it during Draupadi's swayamvara or during Gurukula of pandavas & kauravas?

Source from Vyasa bharatham is solicited.

  

Thanks.

Namaskarams

Ramesh.
