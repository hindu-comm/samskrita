Check Mahabharata:

  

Karṇa (I)--born of Kuntī as a virgin and abandoned

by her; brought up by Adhiratha; became a king and father

of Vṛṣasena.

\<F>1) Bhā. IX. 23. 13-14; X. 49. 2; Vi. IV. 14. 36; 18. 28-9; V. 35. 5

and 7; 38. 16.

  

5\) How Karṇa became the King of Aṅga. The Pāṇḍavas

and Kauravas were studying archery under Droṇācārya

together and Karṇa also was among them. When their

education was complete a day was fixed to exhibit the

skill of the students. The public also was invited to see

the skill of the princes. Everybody showed his best and

Arjuna displayed super-human skill so that the vast

assemblage was lost in wonder and admiration. Then

strode Karṇa to the scene and not only did he duplicate

with ease Arjuna's feats but he did show something

more. The assemblage was dumbfounded. Arjuna turnn-

ed pale. At this moment Kṛpa stood up and questioned

the right of Karṇa to compete with those with royal

blood in them. Then rose Duryodhana and said: “If

the combat is not in order simply because Karṇa is not

a prince it is easily remedied. I crown Karṇa as the

King of Aṅga”. Then there came to the scene the aged

Adhiratha, the foster-father of Karṇa, and as Karṇa

saw him coming he went and bowed before him and

Adhiratha embraced him with tears in his eyes. (Chap-

ters 134 to 136, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
