Hello,

  

Can someone either confirm my suspicion or otherwise explain the difference between bimbapratibimbabhāva and vastuprativastubhāva? (Both conceptual explanations and examples would be much appreciated.)

  

My thought is that the former, bimbapratibimbabhāva, "the relationship of image & reflection", occurs when two similar yet distinct properties of the tenor (upameya) and standard (upamāna) of the simile are represented as *one* common property by referring to both through the use of only one word.

  

E.g.

  

guNadoShau budho gRihNan indukShweDaaviveSvaraH \| SirasA SlAghate pUrvaM paraM kaNThe niyacCati \|\|

  

"The wise man grasps good and bad qualities like Shiva grasps the moon and poison; he praises the former with his head and restrains the other in his throat."

  

That is, the word gRihNan, "grasping", in the case of the wise man (the tenor of comparison) means to cognize, whereas in the case of Shiva (the standard of comparison) the word gRihNan means to physically take hold of. The mention of these two distinct qualities by one word (gRihNan) allows the difference to be obscured and the simile to be made.

  

  

Then the latter, vastuprativastubhāva, "the relationship of part & counterpart", occurs when the common property of the simile is referred to by two separate words.

  

E.g.

  

tApena bhrAjate sUraH shUrash cApena rAjate.

  

"The sage blazes with his austerity; the hero shines with his bow."

  

Here the one common property - shining/blazing - is represented by two separate words.

  

My question is:

  

\- is this the correct way to distinguish the two concepts? I've deduced this understanding from examples in KuvalayAnanda, but I haven't found a discussion on concept vastuprativastubhAva.

  

\- do any other authors have a different understanding of these concepts?

  

Any insights or comments would be much appreciated!

  

Cheers.
