Thanks!

  

My understanding from this is that when one common element in the simile is mentioned twice it's vastuprativastubhAva, but when two elements of the tenor and standard of the simile 'reflect' each other although they're not exactly identical, it's bimbapratibimbabhAva. In the example Appayya uses for bimbapratibimbabhAva, the difference between the two elements is obscured by using phrasing which can be common to both the tenor and standard of the simile, but when applied to the tenor and standard separately the shades of difference appear.
