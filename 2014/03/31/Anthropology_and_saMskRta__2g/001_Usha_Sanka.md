Namaste

The article though short is good and systematic in approach. Thankyou for sharing your thoughts.

Here is my feed-back. (Article statement in italics)

*  
*

*But the above mention of “What is anthropology” brings to my mind a new perception to Purana-s – an anthropological perception, shall I say !  
*

  

Great and correct way of looking at that brilliant encyclopedias. Yes, if once given back their importance and significance in our culture, they shall serve to add many other missing links between us and our olden days. So says the sage of Kanchi- One can find his ideas on same subject here-

Can browse the links for more understanding on this country's ancient sciences.

  

*The British, possibly in their urge to demean anything Indian, which possibly was an essential part of their strategy of governance, gave to पुराण-s, the name “Mythology”, considering पुराण-s to be similar to Greek Mythology. The word mythology has the component “myth” (fiction, untrue) in it. But more the modern science is learning, rather rediscovering various aspects, it is becoming clearer that पुराण-s are not myths. They are not mythology, not entirely.  
*

  

No. purANas are no way mythology. No way. Never. Not even a single word.. except for some "prakShipta" parts (which need a study). Yes, not only British, even before them there were some native people who disliked them in their content and matter because purANas stress on following dharma. adhArmikas never liked them. So advent of British was like a feast to them. These adhArmic fellows had become their "intellectual servants" and they did more damage than the non-Indians did to the purANic culture.

  

*I guess, one can look atमहाभारत as a great treatise on anthropology since it covers all four areas of anthropology.  
*

I think much much more than a modern mind can comprehend, and which any non-Indian discipline can never lay principles for.

  

*द्रौपदीhad five husbands !*  

Sir, it was not order of the day. It was an exceptional case. Only one of its kind. Unique. An accident- that was tried to be justified with many many many interior deep points by sages. Still remains a question in many minds even today. No one liked the idea even then. But it had to be so.. because of a small mis-communication.

No other similar, parallel case has been recorded in purANas or anywhere. So please leave her alone.

  

*Now, that modern science does acknowledge cloning and test-tube births, it seems all the varieties of births mentioned inमहाभारत are not just fiction.  
*

  

As the sage of Kanchi says, may be science has not advanced much for us to understand the ancient scriptures. Let us wait. More is to come. But before that at least one should be aware of these things; learn to look at them as not merely some cock-and-bull stories. If the youth of this country comes forward to work, take up a systematic study and do research in this direction, purANas is going to be very very big area of study, which would perhaps need a separate university..! No atishayokti meant. The one bhAgavata is still under study- new depths discovered every day!!

  

Thankyou for the wonderful article on this auspicious day of ugAdi. (our New year's day. =yuga-Adi- linguistics again!)

Wish you and everyone in the group- a very happy ugAdi.

Thanks again.
