\_Wow\_!!!

  

I have been waiting for this link for many decades. So ten \_Wow_s.

  

Your link (below) to the Kôln University's online edition of Apte's English-\_saMskRta\_ Dictionary.

The Skt. is from Apte's usual sources.

  

The Engl. is the post.Victorian dialect spoken by the British Colonial Officers of Apte's day. There is no dictionary quite like it, Definitely (in the present case about How kathaM &c) you can begin to explore \<how>. You can sniff like a bloodhound or root like a pig.

 It is the most recent project of the University of Koln (Cologne), which has maintained and constantly improved its format to be accessible in DN (\_devanagarI\_) format or in my favored HK (\_Harvard-Kyôtô\_\]. They have been my constant resource for over a decade, almost since they came online.

I would be interested to hear any remarks about relating the Skt. \_kim\_ to today's internationalizing English. Perhaps some wise reader can think of the uses of \_kim\_ . How would a Modern Hindi speaker translate the word, versus how would the British \_rAj\_ utter it?
