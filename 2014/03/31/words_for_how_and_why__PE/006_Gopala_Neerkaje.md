Dear Group,

  

My humble reply:

  

kimarthaM perhaps may be used for why as in the case "Why did you go to city?" may translate to "bhavAn kimarthaM nagaram agachata?".

  

How can we reach the goal? may translate as "vayam kathaM lakshyaM prApnumaH?"

  

Is my use of word 'prApnumaH" is correct in the above sentence?

  

N. Gopala, Mumbai
