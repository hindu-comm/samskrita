namaskar to all group members,



I would appreciate if you can let me know the following:



What are the closest terms in Sanskrit that convey the interrogatives “why” and “how” ? for example to best distinguish - why did he …. ? and how did he …..?



Indian languages, including southern languages (eg, tamil En and Eppadi resp. ) , seem to have them. Where could have Kyon and Kaise in Hindi come from?

None of the case endings of pronoun “kim” seem likely,
