Thank you all for your responses.

 The references provided Bhat-ji are indeed useful esp. the link to spoken Sanskrit dictionary.

Kimartham and Katham seem ok for the context I had asked in my mail.

  

I would like to pose a few follow-ups:

Is Kimartham ‘traditional’ or a ‘modern’ usage? (if the former, can I have a quotation as an example, as Kolhatkar-ji has given for Katham)

Any ideas on where Kaise and Kyon of Hindi could have come from?

  

After someone told me that Hindi Shaayad (in the sense of ‘perhaps’) could be from sanskrit ‘Syaat’, I had been thinking about the etymology of common words in Hindi (like Kal for yesterday and tomorrow) - many which are not Urdu based but don’t seem to resemble anything that I am familiar with in Sanskrit.
