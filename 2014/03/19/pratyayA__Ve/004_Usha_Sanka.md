Namaste

1\. <https://sites.google.com/site/samskritavyakaranam/>  

Dr. Pushpa Deekshit lessons- all in audio as well as e-material. Please see and use it- for step by step process.

  

2\. <http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/en/learning-sanskrit-verbs-2-1/450#Ganas>

For some basic introduction.

  

साहित्यराशि is literature - preferably any introductory books available on dhAtus.

One that I can suggest is -MR Kale's "A Higher Sanskrit grammar". It will help a lot. (Some one had translated it into Hindi- could not find it now.) English one is here-

A PDF of smaller grammar is available here-<https://archive.org/details/ASmallerSanskritGrammar-MrKale>

-best wishes

Usha
