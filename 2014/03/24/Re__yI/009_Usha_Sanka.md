But 1000 names of any God mostly are their "adjectives" not fit to be called as "names proper" - atleast for this purpose on which request is made.

Request was this-

*please suggest me a name for my home in sanskrit.*

*My favorite god is Lord Sri Rama. i think the name may be Sri Rama., but this general one. i want some extraordinary Sanskrit name .*

That made me give those names of "rAma" other than "rAma" itself.

I personally like "dASarathi" - so thought even if it is not extra ordinary- it would look beautiful as a house-name. Something like dASarathi-nilayam.

From 2.5 shlokas of beginning of the 1000 names - Taking nilayam for "home" (and leaving out SrIrAma)

We have- 1. rAjIva-locana-nilayaM, 2. SrImAn nilayaM, 3. raghu-puMgava-nilayaM 4. rAmabhadra-nilayaM, 5. sadAcAra-nilayaM, 6. rAjendra-nilayaM, 7.jAnakIpati-nilayaM 8. agragaNya-nilayaM 9. vareNya-nilayaM, 10. varada-nilayaM 11. parameSavara-nilayaM 12. viSvAmitra-priya-nilayaM 13. dAnta-nilayaM 14. Satrujit-nilayaM 15. SatrutApana-nilayaM

  

Out of these- only 3, 4, 7 only will mean rAma proper. Others are mere descriptive and adjectival. That causes real inconvenience when it comes to names. And not all synonyms for names of houses suit our aestheitics. :)

Not that happy one sir. 1000 names cheated me many times while hunting for names.

Someone asked for a name which would mean an adjective of "success", other than common "vijaya" etc. some years ago. Then I was not part of this group. I could not satisfy them, then.

I find that the suggestions for this querry are really interesting. :) Blessed am I

Thankyou.
