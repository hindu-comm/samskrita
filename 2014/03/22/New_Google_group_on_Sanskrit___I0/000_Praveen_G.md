Namaste,

  

A new Google Group for Samskritam has been created!

Its is called **'Sanskrit Learning'**

  

This group is meant for anyone interested in learning **basics of Sanskrit language and literature**. You could be taking basic classes, for eg. at Samskrita Bharati, or doing a self-study. You can ask questions, doubts, express opinions, answer other's questions, start a discussion topic, etc. All of this is aimed at enhancing our understanding of the Devabhaasha.

  

Kindly try it out.

  

Dhanyavaadah,

  

Praveen.
