That's what I get for my carelessness: this is drutavilambita (samavṛtta). The verse I posted has some typographical errors. The corrected version is:

  

स्मरहुताशनमुर्मुरचूर्णतां दधुरिवाम्रवनस्य रजःकणाः ।

निपतिताः परितः पथिकव्रजानुपरि ते परितेपुरतो भृशम् ॥

  

What I find interesting is that despite these typos, the verse was still grammatical and well-formed.
