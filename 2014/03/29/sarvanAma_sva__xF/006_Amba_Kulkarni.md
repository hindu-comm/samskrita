Namaste Prof. Bhat,  
  

The current sanskrit word form generator needs some improvement in the interface.  
  

It assumes that the praatipadikam 'sva' is always a pronoun. But, as we know 'sva' can also be used as a noun in the sense of  

'bandhu' or 'dhana'. And when it is used as a noun, as you have pointed out, it will have the forms 'sve' in saptamii ekavacanam, svaat in pancamii ekavacanam, and svaa.h in prathamaa bahuvacanam.  
  

But since the current generator, by default assumes 'sva' to be a pronoun (always), it generates only the pronominal forms, and does not generate the above forms.  
  

I should modify the interface to allow the user to select sarvanaama/naama as well.  
  

Thank you for your comment.  
  

With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
