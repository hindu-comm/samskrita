Ram Ram.

  

अयोध्या, मिथिला, चित्रकूट, आम्रकूट, किष्किन्धा and so many names associated with Rama in Ramayana.

  

I think there is some book indexing the names of persons, things, names etc. in Ramayana.:

  

<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry503.htm>''  

  

select any name as all are related in one or other way with Rama and his adventures in Ramayana.
