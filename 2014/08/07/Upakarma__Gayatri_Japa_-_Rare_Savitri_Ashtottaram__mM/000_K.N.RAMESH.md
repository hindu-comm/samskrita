Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. I did not expect to do two postings for the same event but it just so happened. When I had made a plea about **Savitri Ashtottaram** and **Sahasranama** in my previous mail last week, one member in my Distribution List pointed me to a posting of **Savitri Ashtottaram** in a blog and another two offered to visit **Adyar Library** shortly to find out whether they can secure a copy of **Savitri Ashtottaram/Sahasranamam**. Words fail me to express my gratitude for their magnanimity - let me simply say, Thank You!

  

I am attaching the **Savitri Ashtottaram** after recodification/reformatting for everyone's use. There is no reference to the source of this hymn but I presume this is the same as the one available in Adyar Library. The brief **Phalashruti** mentions that one who chants this gets all desires fulfilled.

  

The attached **Savitri Ashtottaram** is somewhat similar to the 128 names of Gayatri which appear at the end of **Gayatri/Savitri Panjara stotram** which I had shared two years ago (not exactly same but very similar).

  

Perhaps I should get started on Version 2 of the Gayatri book and prayers to Mata Gayatri for the successful completion of the same.
