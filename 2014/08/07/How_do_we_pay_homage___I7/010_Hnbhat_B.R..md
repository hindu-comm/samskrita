Advaita and other philosophies do not preach what is after death and whether it is to be by the prayers.

  

Bhagavadgita has certain reflections, but it does not say anything, that the "gati" is attained by the prayers by others. It believes in rebirth theory which is unique to Hinduism. And according different religions, they have they are their own beliefs and you have go through the history of religions and some books written of religious believes. But Indian guide to principles of Upanishads-

  

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि ।

तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा- न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही ॥ श्रीमद भगवदगीता – (२:२२ )  

  

and for the betterment of the soul, after the death, it is due to the Aatman himself, and not due to any prayer from anybody living:

  

उद्धरेदात्मनाऽत्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत्‌ ।

आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः ॥  

  

So there is no question of resting in peace at a place by the prayer of anybody. ONLY the good deeds yields पुण्य, and bad deeds, yield पाप and the souls enjoy the results of पुण्य कर्म in स्वर्ग, and पापकर्म in नरक, and reborn on earth either in any body to enjoy the resultant कर्म-s.

  

ते तं भुक्त्वा स्वर्गलोकं विशालं क्षीणे पुण्ये मर्त्यलोकं विशन्ति।

  

So according to Indian Philosophy and Hinduism, which believes in कर्म theory and पुनर्जन्म there is question of resting at a place.

  

For other religions, you may have to look for the followers of other religion and their belief.

  

Jainism, which has only the state of the soul after death, is only the position in the ether, high and low levels, according to their deeds.

  

Buddhism, which do not recornize the rebirth or soul after existence, than the concience pure or nothing else.

  

This what I can say to your question in short. The ritualism in Hinduism, prescribe many Vedic rites for attaining Svarga, after this life and many things in life. Hence it is not by the prayer of others relatives, nears and friends that their souls rest in peach.

  

Bhagagavan Srikrishna, suggests the way to escape restless journey of birth and death cycle:

  

आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोSर्जुन \|

मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते \|\| गीता ८/१६ \|\|  

  

  

The question about life after death, was first raised and discussed with the death of God Yama, by Naciketa:

  

येयं प्रेते विचिकित्सा मनुष्येऽस्तीत्येके नायमस्तीति चैके ।

एतद्विद्यामनुशिष्टस्त्वयाहं वराणामेष वरस्तृतीय : ॥२०॥



You may read the discussion and the reply by Yama himself, in कठोपनिषत्।

  

'आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यः' – 'Ãtmã vã are drashtavyaha shrotavyo mantavyo nididhyãsitavyaha' (Bruhadãranyaka Upanishad: 2/4/5)

  

This is the starting point of Vedanta philosophy in general, and the relationship with the God or Brahma. All the means to attain the knowledge of the soul, which would result in peace by merging or resting in Brahma. This is the stand of philosophy.

  

Sorry I didn't concentrate on all the sides of your question, as I do
not have the knowledge of all other religions and their beliefs. Only I replied on the Indian Philosophy, the stand of Vedanta philosophy based on Upanishads. I have given the sources for my reply but certainly not for your questions, how people say.
