Namaste

I do not know about specific matas- but generally Hindus believe in next world-- so they say "May the soul reach better worlds-" (उत्तमलोकान् प्राप्नोतु..) \[And that lokas depend upon specific beliefs-- in general it is svarga\]

Or they say- "May the soul get सद्गति .."

According to my understanding, whole अन्त्येष्टि course directs towards this very goal. Their intention is "May departed souls and loosen ties with this birth and find their way to next step (next birth) easily.. "

  

When it is case of a सन्यासी or a realized soul, then they say- they attained समाधि or became ब्रह्मलीन etc.

  

*I heard* that आत्मशान्ति is a wrong term.. because it is not आत्मा (?) that leaves body, but the सूक्ष्मशरीर = subtle body (consisting of 17 parts = 5 organs of perception, 5 organs of action, 5 प्राणs or vital forces, the manas, and the buddhi) which contains impressions from the birth or life-time just-spent. This might be causing disturbance for the soul to move ahead, and all prayers by nears and dears are headed towards that aim- making the soul's journey off-subtle-body, smooth.

Hope it helps.

Thankyou
