I have observed the following in Hindu Temple in New York: Hindus (some) offer the ritual of "ahtottara" or " sahasra naama" in the name/s of their ancestors (generally the recently dead relatives like parents/grand-paarents, older siblings etc.). The priests mention "aatma shaanti" during reciting the "sankalpa!" -- they pronounce "aaatma-shaantyaartham" (or similar phrase/s). I assumed that such "phala-shruthi" seeking the "phala" of "aatma-shaanti" for your beloved departed is normal, accepted and regular ritual. Am I wrong? To do so is an "apachaara" against one's pitrus? Should we do "praayashchitta" for that?

  

I am a little anguished because I (a female) has done it in the name of my parents, grand-mother, older and younger siblings and an older sister (atthey) of my father -- whom I hadn't even seen, but my father had never forgotten her and did "shraaddha" for her throughout his life time! 

  

I hope, somebody will help me out. My father passed away (30 years ago) on the day following Upaakarma which falls on August 11th of this year.
I am not sure, if I should do it or not. HELP!! Please!!!
