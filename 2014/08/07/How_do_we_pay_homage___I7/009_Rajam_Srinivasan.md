Dear Shreemathi Vineeta;

  

Thank you most kindly for this post which definitely helped me a lot.
My knowledge of Samskrit is very VERY close to ZERO. (I have been abroad for more than 50 years -- left India rather young; I was not really trying to abuse my non-existing Samskrit knowledge!) Actually the Temple Vaadyaar (priest) agreed with you about the inappropriateness of the term -- aatma-shaanthi, he said when the devotees request for any specific puja, such as 108 or 1000 naamaas, for the sake of "aatmashaanthi" of their beloved departed ones, the priests simply follow their "order" (as if it is some kind of menu in a restaurant :((!

  

Thank you again, your answer came just in time and also thanks to Prof.
Bhatt for the web-page; the priest suggested that I seek -- Raamaanuja-aachaarya's sacred lotus feet! I am so very happy for it because my father was very fond of our Aachaarya; he and his elder sister actually worked in Melkote (the final earthly abode of the Aachaarya -- I think) and my own sister's marriage was to a family in Melkote, which served the main Temple of Sri Sampathkumaara Perumaal which also houses Raamaanuja's shrine!!

  

Dear all, please accept my sincere gratitude for all your posts -- I am really VERY VERY HAPPY:))
