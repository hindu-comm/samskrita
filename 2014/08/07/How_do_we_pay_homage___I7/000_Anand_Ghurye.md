Dear Friends ,  
  

When someone dies a Christian says " May the soul rest in peace . "
What we say depends on our belief and our faith . A Charvakian may just keep quiet . What do the followers of other philosophies say ? For example an Advaiti ?  
  

Will you point some sources where I can get more information ?  

  
  
  
Regards ,
