Happy to find your question answered madam.

More details about departed souls can be had from Garuda Purana. It is a very detailed account on this subject.

  

We cannot say "Rest in peace" or perform poojas in their names- but I heard from elders - that we can recite whole Akshara-parabrahma-yoga- the 8th chapter of Bhagavadgita - and devote the fruit of its chanting to the departed soul.. It is the general practice.. and they say that its fruit reaches them. I do not exactly know source of this practice.

  

One more thing- (Just to clear- as it happened once before also-) My name is not vineetA- It is Usha. :) It does not appear in gmail even when I write in the end without fail-- because the google fellow trims it off- So I did write it in Devanagari.

I do not know how to make it appear always- may be include it in signature kind of thing. vinItA is like- इत्थं विनीता- in our culture..

Namaste
