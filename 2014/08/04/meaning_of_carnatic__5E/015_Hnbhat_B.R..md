Certainly Karnatic or Carnatic compositions were not composed from English language or British didn't contribute any composition and it is purely guess. But karnataka music should have been lyrics in Karnataka, the father of Karnataka music, composed in the language of Karnata or karnataka land and not of British land. Hence the discussion itself about the English word Carnatic or Karnatic is useless in the samskrita group and meaningless.
