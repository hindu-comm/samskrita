Sir,

  

As per Sheldon Pollock, in his 'The Language of the Gods in the World of Men' "

Kannada is the language of Kannada (KarnATa\[ka\] in Sanskritized form) the "culture-land *(naDa \< nADu*) of the black soil (*kar)".*

*KannaDa* is the *tadbhava* of *KarNATa.*

*With reverence*

*R Subrahmanian*
