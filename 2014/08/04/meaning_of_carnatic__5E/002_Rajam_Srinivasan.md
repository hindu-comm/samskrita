I am from Karnataka. There is another interpretation which I have read a long (very very loooong) time ago! In some medieval literature from one of those formidable Kannada Poets -- Ranna, Janna, Pampa, etc. etc!
The term "Karu Nadu" from which Karnataka is supposed to have derived, means the "black" land -- referring to the most fertile "black" soil which made the kingdom become rich by enabling the farmers to grow high quality cotton, rice and sugarcane. The western spelling "C" and "K" makes no difference in Kannada script which has only one single symbol which is pronounced with the sound of 'K' the first letter in the "ka-varga" of vyanjanas (consonants)--which is true of all Indian-origin (most) languages. 

  

There are several folk tales also-- Once baby Krishna started crying with real deep-felt "dhukka" --sadness. No one could figure out the infant's distress! Lo and Behold -- there comes the Deva Rishi Narada!
He figures out that the baby is missing a friend of his -- a most beautiful "karu" a calf --a white calf with pitch-black hoofs, similar ears and beautiful eyes lined with "KaNNu kappu" the eye make-up(natural) or Kaajal! Through his television, Narada discovered such calves roaming around in the groves on the banks of Kaveri, river.
He was delighted and sang in praise of Lord Narayana for allowing him to witness this "leela" (drama), and also prayed to Lord Shankara; who obligingly and gladly transported one of those calves (probably which was happily running around in one of his temples) to the crying baby!!
(Of course, don't bother to check the historicity of such temples being built in that era!!) and everybody lived happily ever after, including the original "karu-friend" of KrishNa who had wandered away and sauntered in to find a "surprise" -- his own double!!

  

Thus this land supplied "karu" to KrishNa, fully decorated with "KaNNu kappu!"  And therefore it is Karu NaaDu -- KarNaataka!  Of course, your teacher was probably referring to another similar story. Most parts of India have very strong traditions of highly sophisticated folk theater. Relatively more recent forms of theater (dance, drama, music) actually are off springs of these traditions. Bombe Aatta (dolls), Bayal-aatta (performance in the open field or bayalu) koodiaatta etc,etc,.  to name a few in southern part of India. The "fable" your teacher probably was referring to is as follows: Shiva/Shankara once on his casual wanderings riding on his Nandi-the bull, came across one of these bayalaata's being performed! As it was a story about Paraashakti (probably story of Mahishasura Mardini, which is an all time favorite drama of all kinds of theaters) he was intrigued and stopped by! Of course, he was enchanted and from then on made it a habit of dropping by such events. Eventually Parvathi noticed his frequent absences, AND she wondered about it. Saraswati -- his friend, mother-in-law(?) who chanced to observe this asked Parvathi about her musings! After this, both of them decided to surreptiously follow the erring Shiva and ended up in one of these events. They were also vastly pleased with what they experienced and All of them got addicted to these performances. More than that, Nandi started making a bee-line to these events, whether or not his boss wanted to do so. Once the surprised Shiva asked Nandi, why he did so, Nandi -- a formidable scholar of rhyme and rythm answered that his ears "karNa are to blame because they have rarely experience such beauty created by mere mortals.

  

Thus this land became that which created (ka) KarNa= ear-pleasing, AaTa = performances. Even now, all the folk performances start with the "Nandi-kamba" -- Nandi-pillar entering the stage at the very beginning, heralding the ensuing performance. It should surprise no one that classical music of India is "KarNaatak" music!!

  

I know I should stop here, but can't control the enormous temptation to mention another story: When Aadi Shankara was returning to South from Kashmir followed by Saraswati/Sharada on his footsteps, She stopped right at SRINGERI in KarNataka, instead of going all the way following her devotee further Southwards! Because she knew and recognized her beloved and talented Kannadigas:))!!

I know there are many similarly scientifically proven factual info:))
You don't believe? !! Too bad, modernists have no faith:)))

  

However, to me Indians are so endearing when their unconditional, immense love for their Land is displayed in so many ways -- be it stories, fables, rites and rituals, temples, shrines -- you name it they have covered it! It is so very sad and pathetic that for all these, they are mocked as superstitious, irrational, backwards and what not.
