I think the word Carnatic' introduced by British people,before that we cant get any reference about this word. Our music known as SAMGEETHAM only on those ancient days. No separation as Hindustani music and Carnatic! British called the south region as Carnatic Region and,came the music as Carnatic music!! Karna and Atathi are blunders !!
