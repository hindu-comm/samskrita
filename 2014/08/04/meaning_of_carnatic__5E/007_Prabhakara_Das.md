What is the difference between karnatic and carnatic? It is a partial phonetic transliteration of the bharateeya padam कर्णाटक. The "ic" at the end of it makes it an adjecrive, which quqlifies a noun, in the present context "music". Now what कर्णाटक (whether written with "c" or "k" is immeterial) means in the word "kaRNATaka samgItam" (ITRANS) is very much debated. If as his teacher said karna here is taken as sanskrit word for ear then we need to interpret what is अटक (aTaka) in sanskrit. Ti my best knowledge of sabskrit aTana is travel. So may be traveller which here is irrelevant.
