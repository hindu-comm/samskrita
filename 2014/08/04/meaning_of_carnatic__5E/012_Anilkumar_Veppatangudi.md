**The whole of Southern Peninsula was once ruled by the Vijayanagar Empire and was referred to, especially by the British as Carnatic. There was a Nawab of Carnatic in the East Coast. Sangeets Pitamaha Purandara Dasa and Vaggeyakara Venkatamakhi both Kannadigas were well known for laying the standards for Karnatic Music. There is a tendency among Musicians in Chennai of not giving Kannadiga Musicians due credit. Hence this ridiculous -Carnena Atati stuff. As has been mentioned Atati means 'To Roam'.**
