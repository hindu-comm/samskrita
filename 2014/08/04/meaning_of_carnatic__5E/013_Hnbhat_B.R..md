I have no opinion about the claim by many that the definition do not  
make any justification, to the use of the word Karnatik or Carnatic as  
the system of music used still by many music.  
  
Any music should pass through the ears and hence any music, even  
Hindustani, Western, Pop music could be KarnATic and the derivation of  
karnATaka is ridiculous, if it is applied for the system called so.  
And it is equaLLY ridiculous, if one takes the derivation of the holy  
word गो meaning applied to many things, pashu, vaag, vajra, etc. and  
it is derived as गच्छतीति गौः which implies every animate beings or  
any thing that moves could be called गौः, myself and all the members  
make movements themselves. And the derivation given above could be  
ridiculous.
