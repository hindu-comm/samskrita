Krishnamachary

 Samskrutham is fit to be our national language instead of of Hindi for simple reason (1) it lost to Hindi by just one vote in constituent assembly(2)It has several words in all languages of India also (3) it provides no undue advantage to a particular language viz Hindi and maintains equality for all and naturally no one shall resist

  

To reply in jñāna mode:

  

Objection!

1\. Samskrutham is fit to be our national language instead of of Hindi.

 Hndi is not 'our national language'. - There isn't one.

The Constitution has given Hindi the status of the official language and not the national language.  
... that particulars of declaration should be in Hindi in Devanagari script or in English, and it's their prerogative to use English.

Hear! Hear!

2\. for simple reason (1) it lost to Hindi by just one vote in constituent assembly(2)

 Losers are not winners!

 Perhaps you meant to qualify your demand with ' (another)' one of our' ...?

  

3\. Anyway reason (logic) is subject to scrutiny.

 There is smoke on the hill.

 Where there is smoke, there is fire.

 Therefore there is a fire on the hill.

 viz,

 à la *Navya nyāya*

 Smoke? It's fog!

　

 or to put it another way

 the Constitution has more fitting priorities
