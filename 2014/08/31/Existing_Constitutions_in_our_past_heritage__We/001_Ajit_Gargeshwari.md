You may not find exactly the word constitution but various Dharma Shastras Arthashstra and Niti shastra texts were law booksof the past and for personal laws many of them are still used with various amendments as per the constitution on India.  

There is vast literature written on it you may want to refer to P.V. Kanes history of Dharma Shastra available at DLi and [archives.org](http://archives.org).

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
