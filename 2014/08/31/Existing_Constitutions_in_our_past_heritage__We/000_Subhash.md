While a discussion about translating the current Indian constitution is ongoing  
( <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/p2Z1TdeA1J4> );  
I want to inquire if there are any existing constitutions from our rich heritage (probably in Sanskrit) that we've inherited.  
  
When we hear साम्राज्यं भोज्यं स्वराज्यं वैराज्यं परमेष्टयं राज्यं महाराज्यं... what were the governing rules of these?
