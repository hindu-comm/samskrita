Namaste,

There is an elaborate ritual of invoking vaidika & tAntrika devatas for worshipping the “prajA-pratinidhi” (King) in those olden days. This ritual is codified and compiled in the form of "rAjyAbhisheka kalpa".
Firstly, the simhAsana (the throne) of the king is worshipped and there are a set of tantrik & vaidika mantra prayogas for invoking the grace of raNa-chaNDika and other dEvatAs. The devi's vAhana ie., simha (lion) which represents the "dharma dEvata" is invoked on all the 4 sides of the throne. Typically, the throne also consists of the “simha” motifs on all the 4 sides. These 4 simha motifs are worshipped and later the king is recharged with certain spiritual powers since the king represents the dharma mUrti in the form of Vishnu. This is followed by the king's kula devata ArAdhana and Ayudha pUja. All the ammunitions / arms are worshipped including the animals of king’s army like gO, ashwa, hasti etc. This is followed by rAjyalakshmi upAsana. After this, a shubha muhurta is decided and the king assumes the role of prajApati and sits on the throne. During the paTTAbhishEka muhUrta, this mantra is chanted.

Unfortunately, this rAjyAbhisheka kalpa prayOga has become extinct now and nowhere to be seen.

Regs,

Sriram
