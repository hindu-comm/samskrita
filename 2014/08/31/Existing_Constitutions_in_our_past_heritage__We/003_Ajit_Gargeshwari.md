Each King and their dynasty follow their local customs and traditions. Rjayaabhisheka is still done the ritual in parts of full by many Kings and their successors even now but since there are no more Kings the rituals have symbolic value post independence An instance the ceremonies cunducted privately by the Mysore Royal family during Dussera festival.
