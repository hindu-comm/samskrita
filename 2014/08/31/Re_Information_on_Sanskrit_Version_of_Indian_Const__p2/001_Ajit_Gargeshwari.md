I do not now disagree with the groups stalwarts on the utility of Indian Constitution rendered in to sanskrit. As many members have pointed out there is anedd for this very substantive work which requires support and encouragement from one and all and I agree There is nothing to mock about what you say you are right I don't understand you high sounding words Ethnocentric and universality. I stand corrected. thanks to all those who have help me in correcting my views
