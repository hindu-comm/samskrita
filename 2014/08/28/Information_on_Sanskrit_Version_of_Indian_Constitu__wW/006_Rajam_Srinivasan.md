Why translate anything -- in this case the Constitution, into Sanskrit?
Why not? Unfortunately my knowledge of Sanskrit is close to zero; but whatever I know, gives me so much contentment and "santosham." I can think of many reasons -- off hand, for enriching Samskritam by translating all kinds of great books into it. 

  

1\. Can you believe the richness added to the world if we adorn Samskritam with Shakespear, Homer, even such "diggajas" as Newton, Einstein,etc., and topics, such as--Microbiology, Chemistry, especially Physics textbooks written by knowledgeable scholars (for students of all types) available in Samskrit!  
2. Our youngsters whose education is in Ashramas, MaTHa, (mostly studying for the profession of priests -- in fact, in early days if some used the word "profession", people used to assume that the boy is a priest!) develop slightly diffident attitude (not any more, I hope) because they have no chance to be exposed to "modern" things. If there are ALL kinds of books in Samskrit, they can do their "swaadhyaa"; in fact, their current teachers-- the aachaaryaas themselves may becoome fascinated by these "new fangled" things in spite of not knowing English or Latin etc. Also, in return they may add fresh insights to the analysis of these "classics" in all fields. We should be aware that those who are exposed to unadulterated (by modern mode of education) Samskrit learning develop a very keen sense of erudition and analytical abillities (being exposed to all that tarka-shastras, niruktis, PaaNini, Patanjali, Shankara and countless others of the same ilk).

3\. Samskrit has given so much to the world, why not accept a little bit of reciprocity from the world?

4\. If Samskrit students and scholars can be exposed to modern literature, science, math, technology, engineering fields, --wouldn't their reactions to these, enrich us and everybody else. As you said, not only lawyers may argue their cases in courts in Sanskrit, but the manuals of astronautics and computer programming may be in Samskrit which may require non-Indians to study their translations into modern languages!!! Wouldn't that be FUN?
