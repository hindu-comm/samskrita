I am all for translating any type of writing into Sanskrit. If Sanskrit has to be a vibrant language, we need to have the best of literature in the world to be available in Sanskrit. Constitution of India is definitely a work which should be available in Sanskrit.

If scholars restrict themselves to studying existing works in Sanskrit, Sanskrit can never claim to be a living language.
