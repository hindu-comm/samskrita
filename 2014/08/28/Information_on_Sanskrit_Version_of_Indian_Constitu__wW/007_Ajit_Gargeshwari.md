Dear Ajit Krishnan,  

I am not dictating terms what should be written or what should be not I was curious to know the utility of Translating Indian Constitution to Sanskrit. I know the utility of Translating English French or other language stories and books to Sanskrit but Law books if one starts translating what use will it be apart from lawyers who will not able to use it as Supreme court doesn't allow you to argue or conduct transactions in Sanskrit. I hope you see my point ats all. I find the translation Indian constitution to Sanskrit itself amusing
