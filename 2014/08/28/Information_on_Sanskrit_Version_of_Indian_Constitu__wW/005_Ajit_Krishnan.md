namaste,

  

I find your post amusing, given that you wrote the following on a different public list -- "Why should you advise scholars what to compose and what not to compose. "

  

People compose and read works for their own reasons. Personally, I enjoyed reading excerpts from the sanskrit translation of the constitution several years ago. I read it for it's own sake, as did several others.

  

sasneham,
