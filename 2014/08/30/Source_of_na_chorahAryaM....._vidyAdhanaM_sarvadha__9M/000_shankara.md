Namo vidvadbhyah

  

Please help me to locate the source the following subhashita -

न चोरहार्यं न च राजहार्यं न भ्रातृभाज्यं न च भारकारी । व्यये कृते वर्धते एव नित्यं विद्याधनं सर्वधन प्रधानम् ॥   

  

Assuming that it is from Niti Satakam of Bhartihari, I searched it, but could not find this verse in Nitisatakam. Subhashita Ratna Bhandagara Khemraj edn mentions that this subhashita is from Panchatantra. But, I could not find it in Panchatantra too.

  

Subhashita Ratnakara compiled by Krishnasastri Bhatwadekar gives a text named 'Sabhataranga' as the source of this book. But, I couldn't get any more info on this book or verse. Any help to reach the source of this verse, will be highly appreciated.

shankara
