Namaste All,

May be this was asked before but I could not find it. How do I convert the text from this site to Devanaagari.

<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/1_gram/panini_u.htm>

1.01.001 vṛd-dhir āT=aiC  
1.01.002 aT=eṄ guṇaḥ  
1.01.003 iKo guṇa-vṛd-dhī  

This is sample from ashtadhyayi. there are other texts here that I want to see in devanaagari as well.

Thanks for your help
