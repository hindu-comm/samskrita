Not very sure if this is what you were looking at  
  
This edition with Accent markings for Taittiriya upanishad  
  
<http://tinyurl.com/k54rlk9>  
  
This is for the entire yajur veda and the Upanishads can be extracted with accentual markings

Similaly one can extract from the printed editions of the vedas printed with Accentual markings relevant Upanishad section**s
