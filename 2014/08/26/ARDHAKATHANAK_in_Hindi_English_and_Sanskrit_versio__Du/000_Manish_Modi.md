It was more than three hundred and seventy-three years ago, in the winter of 1641, in Agra, that Banarasidas, poet, philosopher and merchant, completed the writing of a unique and remarkable text. The Ardhakathānak, as this text is known, is the story of Banarasidas' own life.

  

When he wrote his story, Banarasidas was fifty-five years old. He believed that another fifty-five years of life remained to him since according to tradition, a man's allotted life span is a hundred and ten years. He therefore called his story his 'aradh kathān', his 'half a story'. Banarasidas died two years after the completion of his Ardhakathānak, so that ironically, what he thought to be his half story became his full story.

  

Banarasi had no precedent in literature or tradition that might have inspired him to write his life's story, or guided him in his task. His motivation to write his story seemed simple: 'Let me tell my story to all'. The result was an account that is more modern than medieval in tone, and which transcends formulaic conventions and stylized ornamentation.

  

Banarasidas composed the Ardhakathānak in 675 stanzas, mainly in the dohā and caupāī metres. He relates his story in the third person, and recounts the main events of his life in a fast-flowing narrative which he interrupts only to muse on the nature of human existence.

  

Banarasi's story is set against a backdrop of Mughal history, spanning the reign of three great kings - the Mughal emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shahjahan. Banarasidas does not provide us with any political or social commentary of the times, but he does give us some glimpses of a merchant's life under the Mughals. This makes the Ardhakathānak important not only from the literary point of view, but also as a historical record of the period.

  

Banarasi charms us with his transparency and frankness, revealing as much of himself as possible. And he punctuates the fast-flowing narrative of his life every now and then to muse on the nature of human existence.

  

At the end of his 'half a story', Banarasi becomes as intimate to us as an old friend; the ups and downs of whose life we know almost as well as we know our own, and whose intellectual and spiritual struggles we identify with, and perhaps even share.

  

Other works by Banarasi include his magnificent dramatic adaptation of Acarya Kundakunda’s ‘Samayasāra’ known as the ‘Samayasāra Nāṭaka’ and ‘Banārasī Vilāsa’ which is an anthology of spiritual verses by Banarasi.

  

Rohini Chowdhury has translated Banarasidas' Ardhakathānak from the original Braj into modern Hindi and English. Both her translations are elegant and flowing and serve to give us a glimpse into Banarasidas’ writing style. Both books are handsomely printed and sport a beautiful cover.

  

The Sanskrit translation by Radhavallabh Tripathi is impeccable. Unfortunately, the Sanskrit version does not have the original text in Braj.
