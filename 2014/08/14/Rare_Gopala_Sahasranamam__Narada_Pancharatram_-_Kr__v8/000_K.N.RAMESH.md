Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As **Sri Krishna Janmashtami** falls on 17-Aug-2014 (Sunday), I am happy to share a rare **Gopala Sahasranamam from Narada Pancharatram, 4th Ratram, Chapter 8.** This Sahasranama is different from the normally known **Gopala Sahasranama from Sammohana Tantram**. This is also known as Balakrishna Sahasranama.

  

Lord succinctly says that even he can describe the benefits of chanting this Sahasranama. The brief description of his verses are included in the preface as usual.

  

Although this Sahasranama appears in a **Vaishnavite Agama**, I think this has enough citations where **Bhedas** in the form of philosophy and Almighty form are shunned as we can see from both the Namas as well as qualifications for the receiver of this Sahasranama. This once again corroborates that such differences are later-day and man-made creations of myopic human mind and the original texts neither subscribe nor prescribe them.

  

May We Pray To Lord Krishna on Krishna Janmashtami day,
