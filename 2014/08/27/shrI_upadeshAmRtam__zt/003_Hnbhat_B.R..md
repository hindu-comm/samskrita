Not in English Titles for Sanskrit Books. English Titles in Roman follow the convention of English language and so the title would mean only "The Upadeshamrita" of Srila Roopagoswamy.

I think it is the book. Published by the Bhaktivedanta It is a fashion to add "

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī  

  

Commentaries by Rādhā-ramaṇa dāsa, *Śrīla Bhaktivinoda* Ṭhākura, *Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura* and *Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktivedānta Nārāyaṇa Gosvāmī Mahārāja"* to titles of the authors and the books, but it has no significance in the Bibliographical convention and need not be a pattern. Moroever, the title being in Roman, need not follow any convention of Sanskrit grammar, just the title for any English book. Srimad Bhagavata is an English Title, Sanskrt correct form Srimadbhagavatam declined form. We cannot look for the grammar in the titles of books, in Roman Script and English Titles for the book.
