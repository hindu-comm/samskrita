Thank you Dr. Bhat,  
  
I was referring to the section of Stavamālā of Rūpa Gosvāmī, called Upadeśāmṛtam or Upadeśāmṛta.  

There are 11 verses in Sanskrit.  
  
<https://archive.org/details/SriUpadeshamrita>

I do not know Bengali.  
This work seems to be entitled Śrī Upadeśāmṛta,  
  
The titles of the works should not be in the nominative case?  
  

Thanks  

Valerio
