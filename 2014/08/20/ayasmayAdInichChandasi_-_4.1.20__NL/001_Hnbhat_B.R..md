You cannot get a complete list of आकृतिगण-s other than listed in the  
गण.The list referring to Vedic usages, where भ-संज्ञा, or पदसंज्ञा not  
following the rule "यचि भम्" are found, such examples are to be  
collected as you find them in Vedic Texts. Only he has colected  
अयस्मयम्। instead of अयोमयम्. Only वृद् गण-s have fixed members in  
them.
