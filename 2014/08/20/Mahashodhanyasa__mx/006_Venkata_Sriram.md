Namaste,

  

This forms a part of elaborate srichakra navavarana archana vidhAna.
This nyAsa paddhati is given in detail in yogini-hridaya, nityAshODashikArNava tantra, nityOtsava of umAnandanAtha, jnAnArNava tantra, gandharva tantra, parashurAma kalpa sUtra. Most of these are printed by Chaukhamba.

  

Some of the nyAsAs vary from sampradAya to sampradAya which again depends upon which guru-parampara one belongs to. So, it is better to seek a guru who is initiated in srIvidyA AmnAya krama and learn these nyAsAs in detail. 

  

The word "chOrakUpa" comes in "shriSTi-nyAsa paddhati" of shrI-krama upAsana parampara where the mUlavidya is placed on brahmarandhra, phAla, karNa, ghrANapuTa,gaNDa, danta-pankti, Urdhwa & Adhara OSTha, jihvA, chOrakUpa, priSTa, sarvAnga, hridaya, stana-dvaya,udara,linga respectively.
