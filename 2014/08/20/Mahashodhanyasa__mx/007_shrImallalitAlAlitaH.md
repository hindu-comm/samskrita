I request Sumit to produce the source from which he took the word.  

Some works define it as कण्ठाधः ।  

As Prabhakara Das said, it is mentioned in mahAShoDhAnyAsa.  

But, I was unable to find the same mahAShoDhAnyAsa in nityAShoDashikArNava, etc. as shrIrAma claimed. What is described there is called as ShoDhAnyAsa.  
mahAShoDhAnyAsa is present in kulArNava-s that part which is lost - is mentioned in some paddhati-s.  
So, the problem persists. You can not even decide that chorakUpa is correct place for nyAsa without tantra-pramANa.  
The meaning thing is superficial if you are trying to get the correct place of nyAsa. First, you should decide that the place is according to tantra-s or at least nibandha-s, which are otherwise called paddhati-s. Then we will see what the word means.  

If you wish to get some help from original books, which are mainly in Sanskrit, you should hear what H N Bhat requested, and never neglect it.  

No one will try to help if one can't even tell us about the source of question!!
