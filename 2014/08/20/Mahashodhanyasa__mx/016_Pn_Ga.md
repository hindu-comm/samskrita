Namasthe Sri Rajamji,  
The Ist page of the work which I have attached with my mail is from  
"Srividya Ratnaakara".As the name suggests the book contains a lot  
about SV worship.  
I understand that you wish to know about SV Nyaasaas only though there  
are different nyaasaas for different deities.  
I am attaching it's title page and some pages of index so that you can  
know if it is the work you are seeking as well as availability of the  
book.The book was first published in 1972 and its revised edition has  
been published in 2012 where most of the printing and other errors  
have been rectified.You can have the book from the publisher image of  
which is also attached.  
If you wish to know about the importance of Mahashodhanyaasa please  
read about Sri Bhaskara Rai Makhin's life the great SV upaasaka.Many  
of the learned scholars in this forum have also hinted about the  
nyaasa in the foregoing discussion as well as about various books to  
be referred.  
Jai Sri lalithe  
Pandey
