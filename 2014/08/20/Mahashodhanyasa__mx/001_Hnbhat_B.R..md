Please reproduce the relevant text in full in the Nyasa, than some part. I don't think what you have cited is not any part of the body, as the word is not found in Shabdakalpadruma or VS Apte's English Dictionary. If you are sure, there is no print error, you may have to refer to any commentary available on the text.
