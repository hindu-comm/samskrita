Namaste,



Shri.Karapatri Swamin in his couple works like srividya-ratnaakara & srividya-varivasya has taken parashurama kalpa sutra and nityotsava for reference. Infact, srividya-ratnaakara is the concised edition of nityotsava which was later edited by his chief discple dattatreyanandanatha.



Right now, i don't have those twoworks of karapatriji with me as i have given it to one of my friends. Once i get back, would refer.
