Namaste,



The area between the breasts & armpit. While doing the nyasa, you shouldstretch your thumb & index finger and place the same below your left & right armpits. The nyasa at the right side should be done with your right hand thumb & index finger; the nyasa at the left side should be done with your left hand thumb & index finger.



BTW, one should be extremely careful while doing mahAshODa nyAsa and one should be initiated in mahAshODashi vidya and should undergo tAntrika mahApUrNAbhiSEka.



While performing this nyAsa, the bowels should be clean as one is invoking mAtrka, graha, nakshatra, 64 yoginis onto oneself.



If your curiousity is just for academic purpose, then it is OK.
