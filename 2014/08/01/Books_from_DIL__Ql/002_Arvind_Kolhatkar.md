Apparently there are several privately made freewares available to download books from DLI - BTW the name is Digital Library of India or DLI and not DIL - and I have used at least two so far. I currently use a freeware called 'dli-downloader-4.4-jar-with-dependencies'. It works quite well and delivers a .pdf copy of anything that you download, IF, and this is a big IF, DLI cooperates and the download does not terminate in the middle for no apparent reason, which happens quite often.

  

My complaint against DLI is its poor management and pitifully small output. Its indexing is extremely whimsical. There is standardized way of spelling names and titles. The output promised is in several formats but the only one that works is 'ptiff', where direct download from DLI is possible only by downloading single pages at a time, click by click. Why DLI cannot develop systems like those of [archive.org](http://archive.org) or [book.google.com](http://book.google.com) to download whole books with one click is something I have never understood. For a computing superpower like India and institutes like IITs and Ayuka, this should be cakewalk, but no, DLI can give you only single-page downloads!

  

Its collection is also very small in quantity, when you compare it with, say, the collection at [archive.org](http://archive.org). I just checked and found that Marathi has only 3904 books in it so far, Kannada has 3335 books! After almost a decade of existence it is surprising that DLI has managed to capture only this pitiful number in these two languages. I am sure the same is the case with other Indian languages.

  

This litany of irritating and frustrating inconveniences can go on endlessly. I shall conclude only by saying that overall DLI gives a poor experience.
