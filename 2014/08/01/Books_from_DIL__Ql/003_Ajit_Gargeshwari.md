The reason for not keeping files on PDF formats is DLI doesn't have multi million dollar funding like archives. Consider the server load if terabytes of data needs to be download. Indexing is bad but lets look at the positive. Its not all doom!! as you portray. This is after all an indirect Government initiative



as no one in private domain want to do anything substantial towards preserving or digitizing books all they want is money like Google Books.

The reason for this on archives any one can upload any books whereas DLI books are free of copy write
