Yes given the difficulties DLI faces I must say they are doing a very good job!!!. I have downloaded several useful and hard to access books from DLI and have been benefited. Indexing people often talk about. The famous editor of Nirnaya sagar press is his name Durga Prasad or Durga Prasada or Durga Prasad shastri or Durga Prsad Sastri you will find all the names with variant spellings on printed books now  

Another example Byakaran Vyakrana Vyakran are titels given for the same books by different editors and publishers  
How does one index?. I agree spellings and typos and quality uniformity on Scans needs to be maintained. We have subject experts, Librarians and curators have any body offered help to DLI team instead of complaining? Lets please look at solutions Thanks
