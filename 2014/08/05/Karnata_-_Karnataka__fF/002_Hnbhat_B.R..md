ಕಾವೇರಿಯಿಂದಮಾ ಗೋದಾವರಿವರಮಿರ್ಪ ನಾಡದಾ ಕನ್ನಡದೊಳ್\| ಭಾವಿಸಿದ ಜನಪದಂ ವಸುಧಾವಲಯ

The above is the word used for Kannada language by Nripatunga in his  
Kavirajamarga. Now about KarnaTa or KarNAtaka, and its definition, I  
am looking for the source of both either in Nagavarma II, or  
KarNatakashabdanushasana of BhaTTAkalankadeva, a grammar for Kannada  
language written in Sanskrit language which is expected to give the  
derivation of the word karNATa,ka used by him in Sanskrit language in  
the title.
