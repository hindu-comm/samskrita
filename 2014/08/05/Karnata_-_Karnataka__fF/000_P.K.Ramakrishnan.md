Karnata has come karinata - place of black soil. The northern part of

todays Karnataka has block soil suitable for growing cotton. The original name was karinata which later became karnata. Later ka was

added which has the same meaning just like bala and balaka. This was applicable to the land. But it became kannada for the language.
