Thank your explanation. I think this is exactly what Mahabhashya has said in his discussion, what is the word गौः? i.e. the nature of the word cow?

  

गौः इति अत्र कः शब्दः । किं यत्तत्सास्नालाङ्गूलककुदखुरविषाणि अर्थरूपं सः शब्दः । न इति आह । द्रव्यं नाम तत। यत्तर्हि ततिङ्गितं चेष्टितं निमिषितं सः शब्दः । न इति आह । क्रिया नाम सा । यत्तर्हि तत्शुक्लः नीलः कृष्णः कपिलः कपोतः इति सः शब्दः । न इति आह । गुणः नाम सः । यत्तर्हि तत्भिन्नेषु अभिन्नं छिन्नेषु अच्छिन्नं सामान्यभूतं सः शब्दः । न इति आह । आकृतिः नाम सा । कः तर्हि शब्दः । येन उच्चारितेन सास्नालाङ्गूलककुदखुरविषाणिनां सम्प्रत्ययः भवति सः शब्दः । अथ वा प्रतीतपदार्थकः लोके ध्वनिः शब्दः इति उच्यते । तत्यथा शब्दं कुरु मा शब्दं कार्षीः शब्दकारी अयं माणवकः इति । ध्वनिं कुर्वनेवं उच्यते । तस्मात्ध्वनिः शब्दः । (पाणिनीयसूत्र ३)

I think your idea is reflected while when the Mahabhashya starts its discussion of what is grammar and its purpose:

  

(कात्यायन वार्तिक)सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे(वार्तिकान्त)

and concludes the purpose of grammar is to just analyze the relationship of the word and its meaning already established by usage and not to create new words not in usage. This is the general perspective of descriptive grammar of Panini and it could well be used as prescriptive one, but with limitations.
