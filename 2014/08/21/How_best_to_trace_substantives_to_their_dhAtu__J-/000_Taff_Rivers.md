All,

 How best to trace substantives to their dhātu?

This may seem an obvious question, but in practice I have yet to come across a method that doesn't get to be a little tedious. 　

Even using a dictionary arranged according to the dhātu system, such the MW, can be a hastle.

When the MW does name the root in the definition, which isn't very often, it still requires a little cutting 'n' pasting of the named root to look it up, the while to keep tabs on the substantive.

 e.g. the entry for **yoga** names √ 1. *yuj* for the root.

**yoga**  
 • *m.* (√ 1. *yuj*; *ifc. f. ā*) the act of yoking, joining, attaching, harnessing, putting to (of horses), *ṚV. MBh.*

**

 . . .

But mostly, it is a matter for manually working back through the preceding entries, looking out for the preceding verb, jumping around if required - usually though, to disappear into the ether.

 viz.

**nārī**  
 • *f.* (of *°ra*, q.v.) a woman, a wife (in older language also *nāri*), *ṚV. &c. &c.*

nārī ==> nāra

**nāra**  
 • *mf(ī)n.* (fr. *nara*) relating to or proceeding from men, human, mortal, *Mn. Kāv.*

**nāra ==>** **nara**

**nara**  
 • *m.* (cf. *nṛ*) a man, a male, a person (*pl.* men, people), *TS. &c. &c.*

**nāra ==>** **nṛ**

**nṛ**  
 • *m.* (*acc. naram*, *dat. nare*, *gen. abl. naras*, *loc.*, *nari*; *du. narā*, *narau*.  
 • *pl. nom. voc. naras*, *acc. nṝn*.

 • \[may also stand for other cases.  
 • for the final, *n* before *p* cf. *Pāṇ. 8-3, 10*\], *instr. nṛbhis*, or *nṛbhis*.  
 • *dat. abl. nṛbhya* or *nṛbhyas*, *loc. nṛṣu* or *nṛṣu*\[vi, 1, 184, *gen. narām*. *nṛṇām* or *nṝṇām*\[vi, 4, 6\]) a man, hero (used also of gods), person.  
 • mankind, people (mostly *pl.*), *ṚV. &c. &c.*

** ...**

  

  

  

  

So, I get as far as to understand that 'women' **nārī** is a derived from 'people' **nṛ** as indeed (mostly) she is, so this does make sense.

But I am still at a substantive, so preceding to nearest dhātu:

**nuḍ**  
 • *cl.* 6. *P.* *nuḍati*.  
 • to hurt-strike, kill, *Dhāt.* xxviii, 92 (*Vop.*) \[567,2\]

Whereby I am in the ether and derived of sense ...

 Surely, these day, it should not be necessary to have to endure of **Pāṇini,** simply to arrive at a grammatical etymology?

It only requires a decent substantive-to-root relational database, does it not?

Maybe a learned one can advise how to makerooting more *sukha* than *duḥkha?*
