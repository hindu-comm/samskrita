To answer my own request, which I post, as it may be of value.

  

I have come acrosscomplete synsets\*of **semantic relations on the Web.**

  

For those interested, they are frreely available (and free)inWordNet 3.1

(<http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn>).

They have actually been therefrom 2001.

Such word relations always apply, regardless of language.

There aredownloadable Windows/Unix versions.

I have found such, very useful for obtainingthe exact word(s)needed, withthe precise meaning, transferable within or between languages.

\*synsets

  

Most synonym sets are connected to other synsets via a number of **semantic relations**.

  

These relations vary based on the type of word, and include:

[*Nouns*](http:///wiki/Noun)

[**hypernyms**](http:///wiki/Hypernym): *Y* is a hypernym of *X* if every *X* is a (kind of) *Y* (*canine* is a hypernym of [**dog**](http:///wiki/Dog))

[**hyponyms**](http:///wiki/Hyponym): *Y* is a hyponym of *X* if every *Y* is a (kind of) *X* (*dog* is a hyponym of *canine*)

*coordinate terms*: *Y* is a coordinate term of *X* if *X* and *Y* share a hypernym (*wolf* is a coordinate term of *dog*, and *dog* is a coordinate term of *wolf*)

[**meronym**](http:///wiki/Meronymy): *Y* is a meronym of *X* if *Y* is a part of *X* (*window* is a meronym of *building*)

[**holonym**](http:///wiki/Holonymy): *Y* is a holonym of *X* if *X* is a part of *Y* (*building* is a holonym of *window*)

[*Verbs*](http:///wiki/Verb)

*hypernym*: the verb *Y* is a hypernym of the verb *X* if the activity *X* is a (kind of) *Y* (*to perceive* is an hypernym of *to listen*)

[**troponym**](http:///wiki/Troponym): the verb *Y* is a troponym of the verb *X* if the activity *Y* is doing *X* in some manner (*to lisp* is a troponym of *to talk*)

[**entailment**](http:///wiki/Entailment): the verb *Y* is entailed by *X* if by doing *X* you must be doing *Y* (*to sleep* is entailed by *to snore*)

*coordinate terms*: those verbs sharing a common hypernym (*to lisp* and *to yell*)
