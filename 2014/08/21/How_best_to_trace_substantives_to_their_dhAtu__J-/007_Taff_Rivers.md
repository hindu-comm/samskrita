Thank you professor,

  

 I have sentfeedback viathe links, but<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in>, is unresponsive.

  

Sanskrit WordNet works just fine when browsed in IE 11 under Windows 8.1 Pro on my desktop.

However, the download of Sanskrit WordNetfrom <http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webswn/downloaderInfo.php>  
has files not conforming to the naming conventions expected by my windows Word Net 2.1 installation  
 viz. index.verb, verb.idx, etc. not to mention .tcl and .dll ...  
  
It would be nice also, as an English only reader, who isobliged to have to convert the Devanagari, before and after using the interfaces,for Sanskrit WordNet to have the option of a Roman (diacritics) interface.
