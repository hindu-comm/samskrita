Professor,

Thank you for your patient reply.

 Inow realise that what I am seeking does not exist, and unsurpringly does not have a name.

　

Therefore a clarification by way of descriptionindeed becomes necessary.

My understanding is that the 'Pāṇinian Dhātupāṭha is a *list of roots* that is an essential constituent of Pāṇini’s grammar and that is required by the set of rules in his Aṣṭādhyāyī for the derivation of innumerable verbal forms and nominal derivates'.

I read 'list of roots' as 'list of verbs'. ([*Shastri’s editions of the Mādhavīyā Dhātuvṛtti and Nāmadhātuvṛtti.*](http://l))

Now, and with some difficulty\* I have found thewords - dfficult, because the words in question aren't always there to be found.

In short, I seek **a lexicon of verbs ordered by semantic relationships viz. hypernym and ****hyponym**.

Linguistically, there are relatively few hypernyms ( 'main/root verbs').

　

Now, our mutual cow will Graze. Graze being a hyponym of eat, which in turn is a hyponym of do.

Our cow being a 'substantive' grammatically speaking, is but one of the trio 'Śabda artha pratyayānām'.

These three. understood as 'word object meaning', where word is but a sound, object an individual material entity, meaning as a mental 'picture' residing inside the head.

Artha's in their turn are also 'threefold'. Such 'Objects',(viz. substantives), whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, behave (viz. verbs).

Where there is cow, there is behaviour - cow will be lying down, sitting, standing, trotting.

Where there is a behaviour, there will be that which so behaving. Never the one is encountered without the other.

Nor without the third -'location' an 'object' will always have a particular somewhere and somewhen.

I must properly locate my words, as being not in the context as of word to sentence, but of word to object.

 As far as I can tell, from random browsings of the specialist linguistic articles,2,000 years on, such a lexicon remains at the discussion stage.

　

Thank you for the your insight.

\*difficulty

**

*Webster's Unabridged* does not have an entry for hypernym.

*Oxford Talking Dictionary* while its does have both terms, is not at all clear about their all important relationship.

WordWeb Pro

Noun: hypernym

 1. A word that is more generic than a given word

 Noun: hyponym

 1. A word that is more specific than a given word

Webster's Unabridged

* n.* hyponym

  a term that denotes a subcategory of a more general class: *"Chair" and "table" are hyponyms of "furniture."*

*Wikipedia*, connects the two
