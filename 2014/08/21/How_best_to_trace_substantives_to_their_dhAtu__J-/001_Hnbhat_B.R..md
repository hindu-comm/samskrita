I am afraid I am not able to understand your question clearly. As far as I know, the primary derivatives are the participle suffixes and conjugational suffixes. which give participle from a धातु, unless you are under impression that all the substantives have necessarily be traced back to any of the roots, like the followers of Shakatayana of Grammarians and Nirukta school.

The above explained difference is to make your work tedious. Simple process, to get derivatives, one can go from गम्+ participles, suffixes etc.

  

गच्छन्, गच्छन्ती, etc. and गतः, गमन. and then little far going, अवगमन, सहगमन, निगमनम्, etc. in which the relation to the verb, unprefixed or prefixed, do not vary from their relevant roots. Then, गमेर्डोस्, गच्छतीति गौः, अश्नोतीति अश्वः, etc. move much more from the verb, गौः means cow and not anything else, that is moving. and अश्वः means horse and nothing more than that, and does not mean anything that spreads. So this is the process Panini has followed for etymology and has followed certain derivatives to their meaning like जालमानायः - आनायः is derived from the root नी in the sense of net. This is the process where the relation is obvious, but little more extended in meaning, without totally ignoring or restricting the meaning, as in अश्वः, and गौः. Other than these, there are many where one has to guess from the substantive forms and many of the roots listed under Dhatupatha are just traced back from their substantives, with little or not change from the substantives. For example, गण्डः \> one can trace back this to a verb गडि वदनैकदेशे, which is obvious that the verb is not used in the sense, गण्डति = distorts one's face. For the simple words, like मुख, नख, etc. one can trace back to some roots, but there is not any relation, with the roots so traced back, and this makes the work tedious and useless. In these cases the meaning itself clear for the substantives even without tracing their root or their verbs.



  

And dictionary sometimes may follow this reasoning, with Comparative Etymology with relation to other Aryan languages or Paninian system. So it is not always simple as it seems to be. So they do not always list the words under the root, unless the relation is clear or specified either by शाकटायन or निरुक्त. Even Paninian system accepts many words underived and consider derived words by उणादि suffixes, the purpose of etymology depending on their relation to Paninian.

  

कमेः सः कंसः परान्श्र्णाति इति परशुः इति । उणादयः अव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि । (कात्यायन वार्तिक)वृद्धावृद्धावर्णस्वरद्व्यज्लक्षणे च प्रत्ययविधौ तत्सम्प्रत्ययार्थम्(वार्तिकान्त)

  

This is the finding of Mahabhashya. So one can try his intellect with dictionaries and proceed to tracing the substantive to some roots, but in many cases, MW himself accepts of doubtful origin. This is what I found.



Now the traditionaly grammarians too failed to understand the relation. Hence the Vartikakara derives, the word नारी from both the words, नर or नृ, both words used to denote man, or people in general.

  

"नृ-नरयोर्वृद्धिश्च" वार्तिक under (शार्ङ्गरवाऽद्यञो ङीन् ४।१।७३)

One can use उणादिसूत्र-s of शाकटायन also, or some Sanskrit dictionaries, which also give many words traced back one or other root. Yet you will find the same reasoning and make yourself the tedious attempt, like मुख, सुख, दुःख as yourself acknowledge without much success, if you are still looking for support for your assumption all the substantives are traceable. I have given the views of Patanjali and Vartika in the above extracts in this respect.
