    Amarakośa  
-   <http://www.aupasana.com/file-cabinet/amara-context.tar.gz>
    Synonyms, with context from Amarakośa  

  

I downloaded them directly through the ColorDict app, per the screenshots at <http://www.aupasana.com/software/stardict-android>

(Note: On Android 4.4, there are no issues with the Devanagari output.)

  

After they have been downloaded via ColorDict, they are also available in the GoldenDict app (the free version has a limitation of 5 dictionaries; ColorDict seems to allow arbitrarily many).  

  

I wish to express my deep gratitude to Ajit Krishnan for making these dictionaries available.
