Namaste,

I have successfully downloaded the GoldenDict application with Apte, Monier Williams, Kalpadruma and Shabdakosha onto my laptop (as per the instructions on the Aupasana site). However, I am trying to find out if I can do the same on my Android tablet. GoldenDict is available as an app on Android, but I can't seem to work out how to install the dictionary files in the app once the app has been downloaded.

Has anyone else tried this and can advise?

Thank you very much

Venetia
