You may use all dictionaries which you are using on PC in golden dict. Same files will work. Extract and place them in aforesaid folder.  
I'm using almost all stardict files which aupasana website offers.  
  
All links are available on aupasana website.  
Download them.  
Extract them.  
Copy and paste in dictdata folder on internal memory of tablet/phone using USB connection with PC.  
  
Someone posted link of instruction. Have a look.  
I hope people are familiar with copying files to tablet/phone.  
  
Now, Open colordict and it will scan all new dictionaries.  
  
Golden dictionary doesn't allow use of more than 5 dictionaries on android, while colordict does not restrict use of more dictionaries. So, colordict was recommend.
