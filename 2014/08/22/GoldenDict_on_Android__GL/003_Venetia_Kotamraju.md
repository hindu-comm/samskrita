Thanks very much for the help. I have successfully downloaded Colordict and the Monier Williams dictionary file (in Roman) on my Android tablet.
Is it possible to use the other dictionary files (Apte, Kalpadruma, Shabdakalpa) in Colordict too and if so does anyone have the hyperlinks that need to be used? 

Thanks again
