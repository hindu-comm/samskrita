Thank you again for this help. We were able to directly download the dictionary files using those web links and all seems to be working fine now on the tablet.

  

One more query - I installed GoldenDict on my teacher's laptop and it was working fine for the first couple of weeks. Now though he is getting an error/exception message which doesn't allow him to even open the application. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the programme but exactly the same error message appears. I have posted on the GoldenDict forum in the hope someone there can lend technical support, but if we are not able to resolve it can someone here recommend a good alternative for Windows computers for GoldenDict? As far as I can see ColorDict is only available for Android.

  

Thank you again
