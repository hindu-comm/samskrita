Namaste,



Difficult to decide which one is earliest appearance of sloka. As usual with other slokas, these are pATa bhEdAs w.r.t to dakshinAdi and uttarAdi sampradAyAs.



Shri.Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni has taken the pada "vishnu" and interpreted the sloka from Bhagavan Ramana Maharishi's perspective. Bhagavan is shuklAmbaradharaH as He is "shukla kaupIna dharaH" ; He is also vishnu owing to His sarvAtma-bhAva (vyApana shIlAm viSNuh" says Ganapati Muni.



Which implies that this sloka with "vishnu" as pATa bhEda was popular too !!



regs,

sriram
