Anyhow I had never thought of the earliesr appearance of this sloka, for this verse I knew from my child hood.

  

It appears in Mantreshvara Phaladipika, in the first chapter as the first verse:

  

<http://adhipurusha.com/?p=88>  

  

and might be appearing in some more verses. It appears at the beginning of several अध्याय-s in Mahabharata also (noted as Prakshipta in the Critical Edition).

  

One can see all the occurrences in गवेषिका --- from a number of sources:

total 6 occurrences of the verse in Mahabharata, and all are noted as Prakkshipta.

  

  

But this shows the copyists used to insert this verse in the beginning at least in some regions and crept into the manuscripts.
