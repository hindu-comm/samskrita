Valerio,

  

स्विद् isadverbial!

  

Prescribing the manner in which a seeker of the soul is to go about accomplishing the task, and his/her/its attitude towards'wealth' and 'riches'.

  

So, gender, of any kind, doesn't come into it.

  

The idea being,to look upon'wealth' and 'riches'only as a means to an end, not an end in itself.

  

But first, the means. . .

  

  

 Taff Rivers

  

 I am assuming the context is the Īśopaniṣad.
