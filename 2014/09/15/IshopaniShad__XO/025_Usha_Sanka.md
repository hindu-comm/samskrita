Namaste

I would like to share a video at this point which says something about translating Samskrt words.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhlrMcQA2U>  

  

He says- certain Sanskrit words as non-translatable. I back exactly same view. AtmA is the first in the list.

Thought, it would be relevant for everyone.

Most of the confusion arises because of that translating effort at places.. I had tried for same some time ago, but realized its futility..(atleast without the original in brackets.)
