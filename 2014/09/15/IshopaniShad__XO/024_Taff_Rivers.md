Valerio,

  

 If I may provide a perspective on this subject.



 As detailed in the **Darśana\*, t**here are always threeaspects toverbal material, whetherwritten or spoken.

  

The material in question may or may notfirstly require Translating- (word for word) conversion of text from one script/language into another.

  

Regardless of translation, the three are:

  

 1. The word itself - as mere sound or visual marks.

  

 2. Meaning - as an abstract concept/thought, occurring in the mind.

  

 3. Reference - the particular thing being referred to.

  

Which brings us toInterpretation- (commentary) orthe Meaning -
aspect number two.

... and the difficulty. Aspect number three, Reference is of necessity, absent.

  

Both 'self' and 'Self' are also 'things' inthe head.

  

I can communicate the idea 'cow', simply by showing you one, or at least explain howyou can see one for yourself.

  

But nobodycan showthe inside of theirheads, wherein these two reside,

thereis butthe arduousroute of explaining howyou can 'see' i.e. experience them for yourself.

  

To use thedual senses of theverb to see, as seeing (looking) with the external organs of sight, and seeing (understanding) with the inner organ of sight.



Suchan explanation on this very topic as may be of interest to you can be found at [http://vedabase.com/en/iso/7](http://vedabase.com/en/iso/7)

  

 Hope this helps,

Regards,
