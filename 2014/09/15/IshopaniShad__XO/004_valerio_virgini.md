thanks for the clarification.  
I still have a doubt arose from the numerous translations of this work.  
  

**असुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृताः । **

**ताँस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥ ३॥  
  
  
**The word "ātmahanah" is translated:  
  
"Slayer of the soul"  
  
But I think it is more appropriate "suicide" (the kṛdanta ātma-han)  
  
because, as taught by the g*ītā*, the ātman can not be killed.  
  
Moreover, considering that ***han*** also means "injure, harass,"  
It may mean "those who torment" any person (ye ke ca)?   
  

thanks
