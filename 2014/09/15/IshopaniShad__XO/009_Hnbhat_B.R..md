The same reason as per Bhagavadgita applies here also.

  

नैनं छिन्दन्तिशस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः।

न चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुतः ॥२- २३॥

अच्छेद्योऽयमदाह्योऽयमक्लेद्योऽशोष्य एव च।

नित्यः सर्वगतः स्थाणुरचलोऽयं सनातनः ॥२- २४॥ *अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयमविकार्योऽयमुच्यते।*  

  

The sould could not also be tormented. Hence only figurative meaning has to be taken, for the translation as the commentators have done.

  

By ignorance of the above fact, those who ignore the nature of the self as if absent. like Carvaka-s. say there is no soul at all, other than one's body.

  

But simple translation "those commit suicide (say there is no soul at all), go to hell where there is no light (of Sun - knowledge), and only darkness (of ignorance) after this life. Or literally, those who commit suicide, go to hell, Literarily, they never get the light of knowledge.
