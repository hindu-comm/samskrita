I thank all of you for your clarification.  
  
From your considerations, I realized that, only with the knowledge of grammar, it is not possible to know all the objectives of a sacred text. But I think the knowledge of grammar can be useful to understand "what is not said." That's right?  
In this way one can "thin out o prune" the meanings to be explored.  
  
Follow the teachings of a guru is definitely the best way to acquire transcendental knowledge, but the choice of a guru implies a previous choice of philosophy; is not it?  
  
  
I think that the study of the sacred texts may show the various Darśana and one should choose the one that feels most right.  
  
Thank you again for your contributions.
