This is true.  
Without the knowledge of the culture, even a modern language can not be translated correctly. What about the Sanskrit!  

I try to do everything possible, but I am aware of my limitations.  
For this reason, this group of Sanskrit is very precious to me.  
  

Regarding the 3 levels of interpretation, it is possible that an author may have thought a work with 3 levels of understanding. This is definitely true. But the differences between a comment Sankara and Madhava are not due to these 3 levels. They are absolutely different philosophies ... and add mutually incompatible.
