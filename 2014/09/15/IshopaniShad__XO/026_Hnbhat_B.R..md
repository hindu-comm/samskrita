And in addition, as shown in the above snapshot, it has got many meanings and the translator can choose his own according to his idea of Philosophy. It can be used in the sense of Body also, than Self and ब्रह्म.and परमात्मन् also. Sanskrit English dictionaries may give more from Vedic usages. Only the choice from multiple meaning makes it difficult.

Just like the absorbed terms like yoga, etc. it can be used as the term and leave the reader to choose from the multiple meanings which are available in the dictionaries. Or otherwise, one can chose as one deems to be logical to his thinking. For example

  

आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः।

  

could be interpreted with different meanings. But the difficulty is in finding the meaning intendended by the author of the verse. This what Mm. Valarie is facing.

  

The mind itself is the friend of oneself, and the mind itself could be enemy of himself.

  

This just running and simple translation, and is very true. When one's mind is controllled by Yoga, = cittavrittinorodha as explained by Patanjali, the mind मनस् itself becomes under controll as a slave and we are not slaves of the passions of the mind. This seems to be the logical interpretation. Here without the explanation, the sentence itself seems to be self-contradictory and repetition of word आत्मन्. The concordance of it with Upanishads, makes some more sense into the words:

  

मन एव मनुष्याणां कारणंबन्धमोक्षयोः। बन्धाय विषयासंगो मुक्त्यै निर्विषयं मनः ॥ \~ अमृतबिन्दूपनिषद्।

  

This gives alsong with other sentences of Upanishad-s give a philosophical touch to these words and meanings. But it does not change the word meaning.

  

There is a Concordance of Upanishad-s and also Bhagavadgita, one can utilize before endeavouring to translate. And the policy in deciding the purport of a topic is an important factor in deciding the context and contextual meaning:

  

षड्विधतात्पर्यलिङ्गानि श्रीगुरुभ्यो नमः पूर्वमीमांसाशास्त्रोक्तषद्विधतात्पर्यलिङ्गानि वेदान्तशास्त्रे एवम् सङ्गृहीतानि सन्ति -

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारावभ्यासोऽपूर्वता फलम् ।

अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये ॥  

  

The above is just a guideline, besides the general linguistic factors in the cases of polysemy:

  

संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता।

अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य सन्निधिः।।

सामर्थ्यमौचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वरादयः।

शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः।।

.  

The above factors are deciding factors in a general sentence in the case of नानार्थ words.

  

This is just a flash of though followed by Indian Commentarors for understanding the meaning.
