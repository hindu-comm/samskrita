I began to study Sanskrit because I was confused by reason of the numerous translations (not just interpretations).  
That surprises me. it is possible that all these different translations are all grammatically correct?  

I'm seeing translations of famous people, quite discordant that does not seem to be grammatically correct.  
  

**यस्मिन्सर्वाणि भूतानि आत्मैवाभूद् विजानतः । **

**तत्र को मोहः कः शोकः एकत्वमनुपश्यतः ॥७॥**

  

Max Muller  

When to a man who understands, the Self has become all things,  

what sorrow, what trouble can there be to him who once beheld that unity?

  

Ernest Hume  

In whom all beings  
Have become just (eva) the Self of the discerner--  
Then what delusion (moha), what sorrow (śoka) is there,  
Of him who perceives the unity\]  

  

Senderson Beck  
In whom all beings have become one with the knowing soul  
what delusion or sorrow is there for the one who sees unity?  
It has filled all.  
  

Aurobindo  
He in whom it is the Self-Being that has become all existences  
that are Becomings, for he has the perfect knowledge,  
how shall he be deluded, whence shall he have grief who sees  
everywhere oneness?  

  

Bhaktivedanta Svami  
One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks,  
in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of  
things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him?  
  

Jayaram  

He who has known that all beings have become one with his own self,  

and he who has seen the oneness of existence,  

what sorrow and what delusion can overwhelm him?

  

Paramananda  
He who perceives all beings as the Self’ for him how can there be delusion or grief,  
when he sees this oneness (everywhere) ?   

  

I think that literal translations should not deviate too much from each other.  
The differences should be alone in the various comments.  
is that right?  
  
  
This is my translation (anvaya):  
  
For one who has discernment (*vijānataḥ*)  
  
it is only the \[supreme\] soul (*ātmā eva*)  
  
which has become (*abhūt*)  

that in which (*yasmin*)  
  
are all creatures (*sarvāṇi bhūtāni*)  
  
  
\[the second half is quite similar for all\]

  
thanks
