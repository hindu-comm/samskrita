Valerio,

  

**\>\>**

**Based on what you say, it would seem that in India there is only one philosophy. Until now I always thought that there are many philosophies and some of them incompatible with each other. Is not it?**

  

**Maybe it only happens in the West, we receive Indian philosophies (Comments) conflicting and incompatible. The study of Sanskrit is a tool to try to understand what is the right philosophy. We are God? We are not God? We are God and we are not God at the same time? \<\<**

  

I am not a Sanskrit scholar and not the right person to answer grammar related questions in depth. However since this question is more general in nature related to Indian philosophies, I would like to share my limited thoughts. My sincere apologies if this is off-topic for this forum. I feel this is a genuine question faced by many and warrants limited explanation.

  

You are correct in understanding that there are many philosophies in India. Let us not talk about the non-Vaidic philosophies - who do not believe in VEda PramANya - which do exist in India.

  

VEdA’s are apaurushEya, ever present, not composed by anyone, however in the beginning of creation taught by god to others and created guru parampara. “VEda apurushEya” topic has deeper implications which may be off topic for further discussion in this forum. Different schools of Vaidic philosophy, based on VEda prAmANya, arrive at different conclusions, pramEyA’s. Since they have to justify their conclusions using VEda pramANA’s, they come up with different interpretations, explanations of VEdA pramANA’s and present their findings and conclusions. This is where you see the same text being interpreted and presented based on the knowledge, wisdom of the matAchArya.

  

Somewhere I heard that “science is the process of evaluation, VEdAnta is the conclusion of experience”. If everyone agreed to one single conclusion you didn’t need multiple philosophies that exists in India even today. The differences are not in the TEXT which is VEDA for every school of Vaidic philosophy. The difference is in their approach to interpreting the VEdA’s and present their conclusions (Tattva’s, end results). They ARE DIFFERENT, some minor, some major. To answer the question - HOW did you arrive at that conclusion - they reference VEda PramANa vAkhyA’s in their BhAshyA’s or TIkA’s or VyAkhyAnA’s.

  

They use either the PANinIyam grammar or Vaidic grammar to base their interpretation. VEdA’s existed since anAdi. Please note that PANini DIDn’t invent the grammar. PANini codified the grammar, formulated the rules, solidified the Sanskrit grammar (similarly other following him in time like Patanjali, KatyAyana, Bhattoji Dikshita, many many more contributors….). Why is it important to know this timeline? Sanskrit as a spoken language and Sanskrit spoken grammar precedes way way before PANini. NOT everything in Vaidic text is codified or formulated by grammarians starting from PANini. There are exceptions which grammarians didn’t codify. There are supposedly texts like Maha VyAkaraNa (composed by VyAsa himself) which documents the Vaidic usage much better. Some of the Vaidic usages does not necessarily fit within the framework of PaNini / other rules of current Sanskrit grammar. It doesn’t mean that they are Wrong.

  

The challenges the current generation facing is the loss of guru parampare and loosing the Vaidic context which came through the lineage. Learning the Sanskrit purely as an academic interest is great, however sometimes backfire when one try to interpret the Vaidic literature. This is where the different schools of philosophies pass on the knowledge from generation to generation. This is not necessarily taught at the academic level. There are many many reasons why the philosophy is not in the mainstream education in India, let’s us NOT discuss that here.

  

Some of the current day scholars end up questioning certain Vaidic texts and argue that those usages are not following the grammar. If they keep the history in mind, this question is a childish question. Why should Vaidic texts follow the PANinian grammar? They should ask why did PANini or the other grammarians didn’t codify or formulate those usages. Then they are doing justice to the Vaidic tradition. Those who argue that
ALL Vaidic texts should follow ONLY PaNinian grammar should be educated.

  

However majority of the modern Sanskrit literature do conform to PANinIyam grammar rules and this discussion becomes mute in the non-Vaidic context. People who want to understand Indian philosophies, which deal with Vaidic texts this is a very very important point to keep in mind. Most of the AchAryA’s who established Vaidic philosophy (I know Madhva for sure) did go beyond PANiniyam grammar to arrive at some of their interpretations which are valid.

  

**\>\> The study of Sanskrit is a tool to try to understand what is the right philosophy. \<\<**

This is a tough question to answer. It may take a long long time to figure out what is right for an individual. This is where the belief system plays an important role. I think one has to start with an end-in-mind. What is the end goal of the philosophy you want to look at, what are the conclusions, PramEyA’s? Does that end result resonate with one’s belief system? Would someone like to probe further? Would someone like to invest quality time to get explanations from QUALIFIED resources? and so on…

  

Best wishes,

Suresh
