Valerio,

  

 I think you have answered your own question!

  

There aretwovastly different cultures, vastly apartnot only in time, but space,

  

being viewed together on the one page at the one time, as if they are one.

  

  

This particularquestion of interpretationis an ancientone, andthe authors are not around to ask for clarification.Given the circumstances, the answer is not likely to appear anytime soon, though there are those today, that by somemysterious meanswouldpresume to answer!

  

Let common sense, aka that teacher, even of the ancients,prevail.

  

Those that acknowledge nought but the material, may be said to 'deny' the immaterial soul and it is said ofsuch, that they will rot in hell, where be demons.

  

Suffice to say, that 'tis wise to ask of oneself, and of others, by what fruits are they known, they that say such.
