Dear dr. Bhat  
certainly these verses of the gītā they want to teach that the soul is immortal.  
But they can not be inferred that the soul does not experience suffering.  
  

In addition, in the Bhagavata Purana, I met some verses in which who is the cause of suffering in the next life will go on worlds tamasic. (I can not remember the verses ...)

### it is said that the soul is सच्चिदानंद,  and when she undergoes the conditioning of māyā, she suffers... even though such suffering is a lack of ānanda.

For this reason I think that translating ātmahan with "those who cause suffering to the soul," may make sense.  
  
My only doubt is that this translation can not be supported by the grammatical point of view.

Thanks

valerio
