I have given the interpretation of Shankaracharya, who admit there is something illusionary called Maya, or Ignorance, and due to this one, who has not realized itself nature, it is not existent. That is meant by figurative meaning, which is not got by literal translation. i.e. It is not called ignorance, of the self, when covered by Maya.

  

Suffering is to the mind and not the soul, as you interpret. Saccidananda is the nature and there could not be any suffering at all. Including mind, is created by the Maya, creating the layer of ignorance around the soul. Figurative translations could not be supported, by grammar, but they should be supported by the principles of philosophy. Only explanation could do justification and not free translations.
