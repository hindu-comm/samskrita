Sorry for wrong typing but I'm using android mobile in which there is Google Hindi input which lacks some words like अवग्रह, द्+द। so sorry for that.  
  
Can I know sir what's this एनद् रूपम्? Its different from एनम्?  
by the way , any link for good discussion on तत्/ एतत्/इदम्/अदस् सर्वनाम् रूपाणि?
