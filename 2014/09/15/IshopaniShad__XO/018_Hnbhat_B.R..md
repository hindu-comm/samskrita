I think every translation could be grammatically correct. What you miss is the different ways of expressions of the same idea of a Sanskrit word, of which you know some meaning. For example, the complication of pronouns in an sentence far removed noun or nouns.

  

यस्मिन् - तत्र both are relative pronouns. It is continued from the previous sentence. The same idea of the two verses, is condensed in भगवद्गीता also in two verses:

  

*सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि*

*ईक्षते* योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्रसमदर्शनः \|\|6.29\|\|

  

यो माम्पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वञ्च मयि पश्यति

तस्याहन्न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति \|\|6.30\|\|

  

And in ईशावास्य, यस्मिन् the locative of pronoun यत् does not have any relative noun in the sentence, than another pronominal locative indeclinable, तत्र.

  

Max Muller has followed the interpretation of Shankaracharya, यस्मिन् - When, supplying यस्मिन् काले, the same adverb of time, explained in the above, Gita verse and the preceding verse of ईशावास्य. तत्र - at the time when one knows the reality and holds unity (with the creation and himself) every where.(this is indicated by अनु+पश्यतः) by context.

  

Now, यस्मिन् can refer to the Self itself Supreme,) in whom, (the individual self) everything created become one.And तत्र - in the Individual soul, which is indifferent from the Supreme soul,) there cannot be any sorrow.

  

तत्र may also refer to the creation also, one cannot have any मोह towards the creation or about the real nature of the creation, absolute Brahma (existing everywhere). This is the cause for the difference of translations embeded in the structure itself. without the interpretation, mere pronouns do not convey any complete meaning for themselves. तत्र can be interpreted as there, then, in that place, or anything referred to by the pronoun tat. (in it, in him, or in them, not any gender distinction).

  

Now, विजानतः and एकत्वमनुपश्यतः are only adjectives, and adjectival phrases, without any noun in the sentence to qualify. But only two pronominal words, यस्मिन् and तत्र, if detached from the previous verse.

  

If it is so simple and plain with Anvaya, there is no need for so many translations, or so many commentaries in Sanskrit.

  

I have a publication of ईशावास्य with 7 commentaries, inluding Shankara Bhashya. There is another commentary by ब्रह्मानन्दयोगिन् also.

  

Sorry for scribing my earlier reply in a hurry.
