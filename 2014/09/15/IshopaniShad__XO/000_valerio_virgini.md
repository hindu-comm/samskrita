**ईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् । **

**तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथाः मा गृधः कस्य स्विद् धनम् ॥१॥**  
  
In the above mantra, the word कस्य स्विद् is generally translated "to someone, that belongs to another." Evidently you consider the male gender कस्य.  
In case you were considering the gender-neutral (which is identical), it would be the correct translation "of any kind"?  
In other words, the verse could mean "every kind of wealth" instead of "the wealth of someone"?  
  
thanks
