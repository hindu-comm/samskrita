I think these aspects are discussed everywhere off and online and are too general. If you are presenting a new aspect, of the question basic relevant to the topic here, the literal translation, which could be possible or could not be possible, without any goal than getting a literal meaning, apart from the Philosophy/Philosophies it represent or a general way of wise statement.

  

In this case also it is possible and there is no grammatical question involved. And the Verses from Bhagavadgita, and other Upanishad-s come to thelp than grammar, for deciding the philosophical content, The two are different and one setting aside the other, can try his best.

  

Any new points or aspects if you want to add, to the discussion as a general discussion on Vedic Literature (including Mantra, Brahmana, Aranyaka, Upanishad-s) etc. could be started as a new topic than bundling them in a single thread. This is my sincere opinion.

  

Regarding Vedic Vyakarana, Panini has laid down many possibilities and has recognized many forms as आर्ष or छन्दसि and it would be premature to decide all the Vedic usage is not covered by Panini. Commentators are there on Vedic texts who come to help in such cases, who identify correct form according to Panini, giving allowance to archaic usage. Many of the verses of ईशावास्य are very simple like the verses of भगवद्गीता if one knows Paninian Grammar and will be able to identify the deviation from the relevant rules if any easily, after he has gone through the rules related to छन्दसि बहुलम्, छन्दस्युभयथा etc. The point is to identify the correct form to get the correct meaning, literally. Additional factors are listed in earlier posts.
