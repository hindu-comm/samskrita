I think you are suggesting of considering the masculine gender, it seems to suggest that "Don't grab wealth belonging any man" ( and could grab any wealth from women!)

  

Just joked. Anyhow your translation as "any kind of wealth" is wrong, as स्विद् is related with the pronoun किम्, only gives the meaning or any body like the indeclineable चित् is used with the pronoun किम्. and not with any noun as I know. 

"the wealth belonging to somebody else" would be the correct translation, i.e. not belonging to you (is meant).
