Here is my English translation strictly following the order of the verse with any deviation, would be correct:

  

**यस्मिन् = In whom,**

**सर्वाणि भूतानि = all the creations**

**आत्मैवाभूद्**

**became the soul (आत्मा+एव+अभूद्) only**

**विजानतः = one knows (the real nature of him),**

**(Note: यस्मिन् - तत्र are correlatives. all others are complementary parts for the complete sentence.)**

**  
**

**तत्र को मोहः**  

  

how can there be any delusion in him,

  

**कः शोकः**

**= how can there be any sorrow (Moha and Shoka could be interpreted differently in English with different words)**

**(Note the rhetoric question in which gives the negative meaning, than interrogative. **

**  
**

**एकत्वमनुपश्यतः when he sees unity everywhere.**  

**  
**

**This is direct translation. My translation may be not contain correct English words translation. The same idea is expressed by different translators and no difference in the purport, only the English order of their choice, which can express the same idea. That is always possible for Sanskrit Sentences and English sentences.**
