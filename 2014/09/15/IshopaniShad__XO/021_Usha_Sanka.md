Bhat Sir, Namaste

Thankyou for the explanation.

Very True, I agree with every word you said- totally.

In the same lines, I have also heard from elders that there are three different levels of meanings for Vaidika mantras. - अधिदैविक, अधिभौतिक and आध्यात्मिक. Some Vaidika commentators had only one, some two and some all three meaning-levels in mind when they made commentaries. That is why they appear as "disparities"- may be?

*"Indian Philosophers learnt grammar and logics first, and then endevour on the study of Indian philosophy with the help of them."*

This indeed is missing now. And knowing Samskrt as language alone will not help to reach these depths.

Thankyou again.
