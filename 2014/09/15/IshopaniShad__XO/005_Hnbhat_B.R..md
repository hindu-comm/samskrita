Please see the usage of the particle in VS Apte.  

  

स्विद् with an Interrogative pronoun. Here it is kim + svid ---

  

स्विद् \[L=31211\] \[p= 1163-a\] ind. A particle of inter-

rogation or inquiry, often imply-

ing ‘doubt’, or ‘surprise’, and

translateable by ‘what’, ‘hey’.

‘hallo’, ‘can it be that’.

**I*t is added to interrogative***

***pronouns in this sense or to give***

***an indefinite sense;** कास्विदवगुंठनवती*

*नातिपरिस्फुटशरीरलावण्या S. 5. 13;*

Me. 14.

  

Here it is the same case.

  

Monier Williams also gives the same usage:

  

*sometimes making a preceding interrogative indefinite e.g. kva svid, " anywhere " ; kaḥ svid, " whoever ", " any one " ; similarly with yad e.g. yad svid dīyate, "  
*

*  
*

Anyhow everybody is free to translate as one can understand. Thanks for the explanation.

  

It is sometimes used dis-

junctively in the sense of ‘either,’

‘or’, with नु, उत, वा &c.; see Ki.

8\. 35, 12. 15, 13. 8, 14. 60; आहो

also.
