So it is what you think the commentators wanted to create doubts to the readers. But Indian Thinkers, up to Vivekananda, considered the explanation as logical and grammatical, who understood the philosophical and grammatical structure of Upanishads.

And you think the author should have only one meaning and they are twisting which you consider the original meaning of the thought. The Buddhist thinkers, who logically had established the philosophy in Vedanta system of Indian philosophy was no more logic.

You hold that the author should have only one meaning, and you know it. I do not think so, and hold any one of the meanings of आत्मन् should be meant by the author. So get confused by the commentaries.

  

Commentaries have read different Upanishad literatures, and wanted to see a common bridge between the religious practices like परमात्मा, आत्मा, परं ब्रह्म. एकमेवाद्वितीयं ब्रह्म, सोऽमात्मा, तत् त्वम् असि etc. So different thinkers built up their own logical theories to bridge these statements, though not by a single author. If you do not accept the unity of the Upanishadic philosophy, then you can stick to one meaning, and try to get synchronize the different statements through out.

  

Regarding theanvaya:

It is the context that gives the meanings a difinte sense and logic. Logic should follow the context.

  

Indian Philosophers learnt grammar and logics first, and then endevour on the study of Indian philosophy with the help of them. The reverse you are seeking to learn Sanskrit for you are not satisfied with the translations and not to understand the philosophy you already know with English Terminology for Indian Philosophical words.

  

  

Sorry. All the words themselves are themselves expressive with their inflected form and no need for an "anvaya" to paraphrase to accord the wordings to the syntax of your language, which may distort the meaning.

  

You started with grammatical meaning, and then philosophical meaning and now again rest in "anvaya" in a logical sequence. And get confused about the meaning and interpretations the commentators and translators give.
