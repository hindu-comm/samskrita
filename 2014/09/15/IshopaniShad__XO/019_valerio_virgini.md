Dear dr,Bhat  
  
Thank you so much for the exhaustive explanation.  
  
These explanations are extremely helpful for me.  
  
  
In my opinion, the translation of Max Muller is closer to the structure of Sanskrit.   
While the translation of Bhaktivedanta Svami (which is more like an explanation) is the one that "shines" the most.  
  
I think the commentaries are not used to understand the meaning of the verse. They are often conflicting and create doubts.  
  
The commentaries "twist" the original meaning of thought by the author.  
In this way the meaning given by the author becomes doubtful.  
  
The commentaries are useful from the literary point of view, since they show different meanings of the same structure.  

For example, the term ātman means: Supersoul, the self, Lord.  
You do not think that the author had only one of these meanings in mind?  
  

Regarding the anvaya:  
It can not give the meanings that give comments,  
but it can give a logical sequence and clarify the subject and the object.  
  
For example: *abhūt *is 3rd singular and can not refer to *sarvāṇi bhūtāni*, as some translator has done.  

  
Honestly, I did not realize yasmin-tatra as correlative ... so everything is clear.  
  
  
One more question:  
  
You said: "विजानतः and एकत्वमनुपश्यतः are only adjectives"  
Surely they are adjectives, but could not be used as nouns?  
For one who is wise; for one who sees the uniqueness "?
