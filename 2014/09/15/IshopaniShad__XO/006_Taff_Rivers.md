hnbhat,

  



 Yes,it is it sometimes '*makes a preceding interrogative indefinite*'.

  

The MW entry for svid, has it as down asan 'indeclinable',thereforeofadverbial usage.

  

  

Those individual words, in isolation are of course -pronouns-albeit of an indefinite kind, but whencombined with the interrogative, as here,adverbs of manner are intended.

  

Taking the spiritual contextof the workinto account, It also makes for better linguisticcohesion and cohesion tointerpret so.

  

The idea seems tobe to cultivatetheattitude of undesirability towardsthe material, as expressed elsewhere by 'the love of money is the root of all evil'.

  

Whereby 'tis not money that isevil, but the 'love' i.e. desire of it which is so.

  

Thus, the manner (adverbially speaking!)by which Iso justify my interpretation.

  

  

If I may say so, material things are, as always,essential, for without them is no bodily container wherein the soul to dwell!

  

Anyway, what's not to love about chocolate, cheese ...?

  

Are words material?
