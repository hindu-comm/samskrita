Gaṇadhara Sudharma Svāmī ’s teachings to his disciple Jambu Svāmī, .

As recorded in the Kalpa Sūtra

**  
**

सुधर्म - खमियब्बं, खमायियब्बं

उवसमियब्बं, उवसमायियब्बं

जो उवसमै, तस्स अत्थि आराहणा

जो ण उवसमै तस्स णत्थि आराहणा

**  
**

जम्बु - तं केण अत्थेण भंते?

**  
**

सुधर्म - उवसमसारं खु सामण्णं

\_\_\_\_

**  
**

Sudharma - khamiyabbaṃ, khamāyiyabbaṃ

uvasamiyabbaṃ, uvasamāyiyabbaṃ

jo uvasamai, tassa atthi ārāhaṇā

jo ṇa uvasamai tassa ṇatthi ārāhaṇā

**  
**

Jambu - taṃ keṇa attheṇa bhaṃte?

**  
**

Sudharma - uvasamasāraṃ khu sāmaṇṇaṃ

\_\_\_\_

**  
**

Sudharma - Forgive others and seek their forgiveness.

Attain equanimity and help others attain equanimity.

One who is in equanimity is truly accomplished.

One who is not in equanimity has no accomplishment.

**  
**

Jambu - In what sense do you mean this, o venerable one?

**  
**

Sudharma - Equanimity is the essence of asceticism.

**

In pursuit of equanimity, we forgive you and ask for your forgiveness.
