Thank you Sir.

  

It took me a while to figure out you mean the site<http://www.sanskritdeepika.org/> for Sanskrit Deepika. Many thanks.

  

I have been able to getकाव्यालङ्कारसङ्ग्रहः of Udbhata and will check that out. If you know (especially online) a place where I can getVivRti on Bhamaha and can share, that would be very helpful to me.

  

Thanks again,

Regards,

Sandeep
