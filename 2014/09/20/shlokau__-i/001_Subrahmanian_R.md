In some places, the optional अनुस्वार is to be used as in अनेकदंतं

अग - न गच्छति इति अग: mountain

अगस्य पुत्री mountains daughter, अगजा Parvati

अगजानन literally 'having Parvati's face' here it should be Parvati's son;

पद्मार्कं - पद्म is lotus, अर्क a learned man, or Sun - but these are words

used to glorify Gods/ deva devatas or Guru etc

गजाननं the elephant faced - Ganes'a

अहर्निशम्\* day and night

अनेकदंतं - अनेकदं तं - एक one, अनेक many, अनेकद: one who gives/ bestows many (good) things

तं him

भक्तानां to the devotees

एकदंत: - one possessing a single tusk; तं - एकदंतं

उपास्महे - I worship

\* aside the point: अहर्निशम् - I notice that in English and Sanskrit the sequence is 'day and night' - अहोरात्रं, अहर्निशम्, दिवानक्तम्, but in Tamil (my mother tongue) and in Hindi, generally the sequence is the opposite - दिन रात, tamil - राप्पगल्

  

With reverence
