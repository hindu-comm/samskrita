Namaste,

arka-sun; and pArvati's face is compared with padma(lotus). Just as lotus blooms with the sight of sun,the lotus-like face of pArvati blooms with the sight of Her beloved son gaNapati who is compared with sun arka.

so, agajAnanapadmArkaM implies one who is the sun to the lotus-like face of pArvati.
