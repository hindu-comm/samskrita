There is no doubt it is a regular optative parasmaipada form. But only that it is not sanctioned by Paninian, any of the rules governing the
परस्मैपद or आत्मनेपद, but the forms for the verb वृत् only approved as आत्मनेपद for the root covered by the rule अनुदात्तङित आत्मनेपदम्. This was meant by अपाणिनीय by the first poster, form not approved by Panini directly.

  

It could be forced to be approved, a loophole in Sutra, as Panini has himself suggested that it may be sometimes overruled which is indicated making even the अनुदात्तेत् verb चक्षिङ् appending ङ् which is also indicator of आत्मनेपद. You can call them irregular forms for the verb, if you feel it is not अपाणिनीय.

  

There is no provision directly for this verb, governing both परस्मैपद and आत्मनेपद according to meaning covered byस्वरितञितः कर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफलेP.I.3.72. and the rules following it. Hence the परस्मैपद forms are not governed by पाणिनि's rules and अपाणिनीय in that sense. Or irregular usage covered by आर्ष usage and not in the regular usage परस्मैपद usages are found in the classical literature, but archaic usages.
