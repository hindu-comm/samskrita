Meaning is something like this:

The hair of eyelid (अक्षिपक्ष्म).doesnot grow.(कदा लुप्तं)

Whereas the hairs on head keeps growing(शिरोरुहाः), hence it is cut again & again whenever it grows(छिद्यन्ते हि).

Similarly when some one grows himself towards improvisation,(वर्धमानात्मनामेव)definitely he has to face a lot of vipattis/obstacles. ie., Obstacles are certain when someone grows in life.

  

Thanks a lot Shankar Mahoday & HN Bhat sir.

This was the sloka I was looking for.
