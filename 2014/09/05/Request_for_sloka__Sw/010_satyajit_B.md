Dear Learned members,  

  
Once in a while, I go thru the old posts in detail, it is instructive and enlightening.  
  

This thread demonstrated the amazing quality of this group to help members.  
  

To summarize,  

 The query to begin with was like searching a needle in a haystack.  

 Having come across something akin to the query, the correct subhashita was posted  

 Then the meaning too was explained.  

 All this within five days of the query being posted.  
  

It is really heartening to see a group helping its members in this fashion.  
  

I bow with reverence to the learned members  
  

The replies and the guidance by members like Dr. Bhat, Shri Aravind Kolhatkar Ji and Shri Sunder Hattangadi Ji ( and here are many many
more learned members-whom I respect, ) are always a treat to go through. At times, excellent links are posted by the learned members, which are very useful.  
  

I think it was my good fortune to have joined this group
