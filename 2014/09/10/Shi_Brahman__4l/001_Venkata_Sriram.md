Namaste,



My vedic teacher once told me that rishis may not be historic personalities like vashishta,vamadeva etc. The mantra adhishtana tattva / sarva vyApaka paramAtma is also called "rishi" going by the pramana



ya imAni vishwA bhuvanAni juhvAt rishih hOta ........AvivEsha



mahidhara & sayana explains the above rik and says that since paramAtma is "sarva-drSTa", is also called a rishi.



Not only this, there are several mantras for which "brahma" is the rishi. One among them is dakshinamurti mantra



regs,

sriram
