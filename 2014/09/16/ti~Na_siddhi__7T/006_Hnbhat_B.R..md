This does not apply here. This policy applies only where we find even if they are usually fall under the rules governing इत्संज्ञा, and we cannot find them deleted because of being इत्, as per "तस्य लोपः". In this case, "न विभक्तौ तुस्माः" does not allow इत्संज्ञा to be applied in these cases in विभक्तिप्रत्यय-s. So it does not have इत्संज्ञा. And only in other cases, if there is not any obvious प्रयोजन, इत्संज्ञा itself is not applied it will not allow the desired form. There are only certain cases, where they are called उच्चारणसामर्थ्यात् न लोपः। The ल् in लट् does not get the इत्-सञ्ज्ञा by 1-3-8 लशक्वतद्धिते because of उच्चारणसामर्थ्यात् प्रयोजनाभावाच्च. If इत् is applied, he could not apply the अधिकार, "लस्य" throughout. Here also the same thing. "झोऽन्तः" could not be applied and "चुटू" is not applied to झ्. In this case, the विभक्तिसंज्ञा is applied and the इत्संज्ञा itself is prohibited as per the rule and the लोप does not apply at all.

  

The लोप of स् is prescribed by another rule, "नित्य ङितः" in लङ्, लोट् etc.
