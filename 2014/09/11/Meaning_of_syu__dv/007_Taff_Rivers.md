Jaichander,

  

 Interesting!

I have obtained a Romanised version ***Bhatti Ravanavadha (Bhattikavya).htm*** from GRETIL.

And have been scanning it for your quote

स्युः *(syuḥ)* = अस् धातोः *(as dhātoḥ)* (विधि *(vidhi)*)लिङ् लकारे *प्रथमपुरुष*-*बहुवचना*न्तं रूपम् *(liṅ lakāre prathamapuruṣa-bahuvacanāntaṃ rūpam)*

However (Iread *बहुवचना*न्तं as *bahuvacanāntāṃ*), I can't pick it up.

I'm looking for that stuff on potential/optative moods.

  

What rendition, what Chaper & Verse No.s do I seek?
