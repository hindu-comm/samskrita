Ramaya Rama Bhadraya

Ramachandraya Vedhase

Raghu Nathaya Nathaya

Sitayah Pataye Namaha



For Kausalya he is Raama, for Dasaratha he is Ramabhadra, for his brothers he is Ramachandra, for people of ayodhya he is Raghunaatha & of course for seetha he is naatha. To that Rama I bow down.

This was the meaning given in one of RK Mutt's book.

  

I am interested in the actual meaning of the sloka word by word.

  

thanks & namaskarams
