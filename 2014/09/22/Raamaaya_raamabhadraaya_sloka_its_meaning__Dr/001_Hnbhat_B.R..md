I don't think there is any other meaning than the salutation to Rama, the lord (नाथ), called by these names. Otherwise the above translation is correct as it correctly relates by that Rama I bow.

  

The lord of Raghu's, and who is lord to the devotees, and husband of Sita. Here is the similar explanation.

I don't under understand what do you mean by "actual" meaning? All are the names of Srirama.
