Dear all,  

Please find attached the test page for a PHP based machine for subanta generation according to Siddhanta kaumudi.  
<http://lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/subanta.html>  
  

The code can be seen at <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/sanskrit>  
  

The machine gives step by step derivation of words as per prakriyA mentioned in Siddhantakaumudi.  

Respected scholars may please have a look at it and suggest corrections where the machine is off the correct derivation process.  

Please send corrections off list, so that they can be incorporated.  
  

"Documentation" and "Known Issues" are in progress.  

I am attaching a sample page of 'rAma' derivation for ready reference.
