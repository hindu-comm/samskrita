Years ago I created a post on how to [memorize ashtadhyayi](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/Ur6lpPYtxXM). I thought to write an update to that post, I can not tell you how many timesI feel like quitting and infact did few times as well, but I kept coming back again and again. Call my previous punyam.

All I can say it was a wonderful journey to go through. 



Out of many methods that I tried - Belowproposed method by Acharya Nagendra Pavan worked best for me, with this method I started to handle entire chapters rather than just few sutras at a time.

I wish I knew about this when I started it, I would have probably memorized it lot sooner.



**Acharya Nagendra Pavana's method.**

He is the one who recited ashtadhyayi for Vyomalabs.



1\. Take 50 or 100 Sutras whichever you feel comfortable - I would say start with 50, once you get the hang of the method anddevelopa disciplined routine increase it to your liking.

2\. For one week listen from start to finish, and repeat after listening, do this as many times as you can. I had long drive so I used to listen 2 to 3 times a day.

3\. Second week pick another 50 - 100 or as per your capacity. Do the same as you did for first week.  
4. Also during second week dedicate 1hr/day either in the morning or in the evening. Read10 times from1-11, 11-21, 21-31, 31-41, 41-51 .... do this for entire second week while listening to new set of sutras during other times in the day. When you do like this after 4th or 5th repetition you don't even have to look at text.

5\. For third week - new 50 - 100 sutra and 10 times repetition as mentioned before of second week sutras. Keep reapeating this cycle till the end.

6\. Once you complete chapter then read entire Pada 10 times, same after completing each adhyaya. Once you follow this method, you can recite entire chapter in just few mins. For me I can recite 100 sutras in \~3 mins.

Adhyaya 1 2 7 8 each takes less than 8 mins. 3, 4 - 10-12 min each and 5& 6 \~20 mins each.

Overall entire ashtadhyayi can be recited from start to finish in less than 2 hrs time. This method works because within a span of a week one listens/recites one stura over 100+ times. That solidifies in the brain. Its sort of becomes second nature, where one does not have to guess whats next. It automatically comes.



Also do not memorize in ashtadhyayi order because you will hit the wall specially in4 & 5th chapter. The order I would recommend = Adhyaya - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 5

or you can also do 1 - 2 - 3 -7 -8 -6 -4 - 5,



Make sure to do ashtadhyayi parayana once or twice a week to keep it fresh, the frequency may vary to individual.



**Different approaches that I took and did not work for me -**

1\. Plain listening again and again, you can memorize but takes long time. Ashtadhyayi is a long text, one sutra a day would take 11 years. That's how big it is. 

2\. Sets of 20, little better than previous method, because small sections are easy to remember. But still takes long time.

3\. Individual sutra - this was the worst mistake I made. You can listen to one sutra but repetition gave me headache and bored me to death.

4\. Creating presentations as visual aid - its ok at the beginning but does not work for long, because hard to have focus to watch the screen for long with nothing but boring sutras flashing for few seconds at a time.

5\. Anki flash cards - its so so but not great as everybody claims, because it starts randomizing after first learning and its not good with respect to ashtadhyayi learning. because before randomization one should be able to say the sutra very fluently. If you are fumbling then its not correct. $25 was steep price for iDevices but not a good tool for learning ashtadhyayi.

6\. Flashcards approach to daily quota. The problem with daily quota is that once you fall behind it hurts your morale real bad, and gives you the feeling, may be its too difficult for me.

7\. keeping track of excel to see how far you have to go, bad idea to see everyday. May be once every few months to chart your progress. Really you don't need much charting here, 32 Padas to memorize - 8 is quarter, 16 is half that's all you need.



Please share your experience as well.

Looks like I found the holy grail that worked for me - next in the list is Bhagwadgeeta. wish me luck.
