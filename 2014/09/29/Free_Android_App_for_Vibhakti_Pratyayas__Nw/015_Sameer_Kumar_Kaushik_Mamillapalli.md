Namaste,

There is a need to have Mac OS systems to develop ios Apps(although there are some cross-development kits, but they are fuzzy). I dont have a Mac. I will try to loan one some time later and see how easy is it to develop in ios. I have to learn that and may take some time.

  

Regards,

Kaushik
