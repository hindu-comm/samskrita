Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. Asthe second instalment for ensuing **Navaratri**, I am happy to share a rare **Lakshmi Sahasranama** said to be from **Padma Puranam** and was created by **Lord Vishnu** Himself. The **Phalashruti** mentions that one who prays both **Lord Vishnu** and **Lakshmi** with this **Sahasranama** gets poverty burnt away and begets all kinds of wealth.

  

There are at least 4 Lakshmi Sahasranamas I know of and it looks like there is yet another Lakshmi Sahasranama in Padma Puranam itself titled **Ashtadashabhuja Mahalakshmi Sahasranama (**which I am yetget**)**Though there are individual **Ashtottarams** for the eight Lakshmi forms (**Ashtalakshmi**), I am not aware of any Sahasranamas for these - in fact, I am not aware of hymns on these forms apart from **Dhyana Shlokas**. There is a hymn on **Siddha(I) Lakshmi**.

  

As mentioned before, **Vinayaka Tantram** contains **Siddhi/Buddhi Ashtottarams/Trishatis/Sahasranamas/Hrudayams** and **Kavachams**. Here **Siddhi is same as Lakshmi and Buddhi is same asSarasvati**. In addition, this Tantra also treats **Lord Ganapati** as **Sharadesha**.

  

As I had to cram this Sahasranama encoding/proof-reading in a short time, I am afraid I have not done full justice to proof-reading. Apologies if there are errors.

  

Also, many people wrote to me that they are not able to download specific language version in the last two postings. It looks like their own mail servers are truncating the file names and suffixes. While I will endeavour to shorten the filenames hereafter, the convention I have been following is:

  

**\<File Name>.pdf - Sanskrit; \<FileName> - TAM.pdf - Tamil; - TEL for Telugu, -KAN for Kannada, -MAL for Malayalam, -ENG for English.**

  

May We Pray To **Goddesses Durga/Lakshmi/Saraswati** during this Navaratri Puja.
