Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. As third and final part of hymns for ongoing **Navaratri**, I am glad to share a rare **Sarasvati Sahasranama from Rudra Yamalam**. One need to speculate on the efficacy of this hymn as **Lord Shiva** pellucidly mentions that even He, with all of his five heads, will not be able to describe the benefits of this hymn even if he tries for hundreds of **Kalpas**. That would more than suffice.

  

The commonly used **Sarasvati Sahasranama** is from **Skanda Puranam** (as usual, the print edition does not contain this). In addition to this, I understand that there is a **Sharada Sahasranama** - I thought it could be available in **Sringeri Sharada Mutt** and enquired them but they don't seem to have it. I also understand that there is a **Nilasaraswati Sahasranama** used in Tantric worship. In addition to these, the **Buddhi Saharanama in Vinayaka Tantram** is nothing but Saraswati Sahasranama.

  

The **Saraswati** hymns in the **Purans** are not that many although all purans/sections start with a salute to **Sarasvati** - and I have shared many of them before. But **Sringeri Acharyas** (the entire parampara/lineage) have composed many potent **Stutis** (dozens and dozens of them) including the famous **Kamalajatayitashtakam** as **Goddess Sharada** being the presiding deity of the mutt.

  

May We Pray To Goddess Sarasvati during this Navaratri!
