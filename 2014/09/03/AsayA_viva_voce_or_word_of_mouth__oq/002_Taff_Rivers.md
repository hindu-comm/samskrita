*āsayā =* **viva voce = by word of mouth**

*āsayā* is indeed in the instrumental, indicated by the English preposition ***by.***

****

Taken in its context as an ***adhi****-**kāra*** of an electronic posting, āsayā has the meaning given under one of the **ās** headwords.

It would appear to be Vedic.

**ās**  
• *n.* (?) mouth, face, (only in *abl.* and *instr.*) *āsas* (with the *prep. ā*), from mouth to mouth, in close proximity, *ṚV. vii, 99, 7*.  
• *āsā* and *āsayā* (generally used as an *adv.*), before one's eyes.  
• by word of mouth. • personally. • present. • in one's own person. • immediately, *ṚV. vi, 16, 9, &c.* \[159,3\]
