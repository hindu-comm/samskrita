I don't know whether this is a coined word for new species described by Botanists. But Pali text has this word:

  

Sīho bhikkhave migarājā sāyanhasamayaṃāsayānikkhamati.Āsayānikkhamitvā vijamhati.

5:10 Kakudhavaggo - Pali

  

fr. Chald āsayā, to heal, cf. Heb. asā,. Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary.

  

Anyhow, it is instrumental case*āsā* if such word exists in Sanskrit.

  

Here is the VS Apte's entry for the word:

**1. आसा āsā : (page 372)**

**ocean (including it); R.**

**आसव āsavaआसव see under आसु.**

***आसा āsā आसा* Ved. Proximity, nearness; आसया near, in the presence of.**

  

which has nothing to do with आस्य which you had expected.
