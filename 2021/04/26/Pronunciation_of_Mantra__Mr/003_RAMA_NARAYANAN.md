The correct pronunciation of the navarna mantra is,

  

ऐं - Aim  

ह्रीं - Hreem

क्लीं - Kleem.

Give little pause between each letter. But, the japa should be manasic.

  

similarly, for maha mrutunjay mantra, it should be tryambakam not tryambakan. Because, tryambakam is noun and yajamahe is verb. So, here guna sandhi won't come.

  

Bhavateeya,

  

Rama narayanan.
