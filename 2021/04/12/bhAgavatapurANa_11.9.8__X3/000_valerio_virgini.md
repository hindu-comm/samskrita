Dear scholars  
  
in the following verse of the Bhāgavata-purāṇa, I cannot identify the word निरभिदत्  
I have looked over various texts and there are no transcription errors.  
Can anyone help me understand the form of that word?  
  
उभयोरप्यभूद्घोषो ह्यवघ्नन्त्याः स्वशङ्खयोः।  
तत्राप्येकंनिरभिदद्एकस्मान्नाभवद्ध्वनिः ॥  
  
Thank you  
valerio
