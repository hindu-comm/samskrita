**१. श्रूयतां धर्मसर्वस्वं श्रुत्वा चैवावधार्यताम्।**

I know that**श्रुत्वा** has क्त्वा pratyaya. but what is the gramatical status of**श्रूयताम्.** I don't think it has any place in lakaras. so I what to know which pratyaya is that. This is even used in shakara's entire उपदेशपञ्चकम्...

२. **कलाभ्यां, फलाभ्यां, शिवाभ्यां, भवाभ्यां.**.. this are few words in the first sloka of shivananda lahari...

What is भाम् here.. I think this is not the usage of द्विवचन of ४,५,६ vibhakti usage.. So there must be some pratyaya for this as well...

  

I will be very much thankful if this solved...

Thank you..
