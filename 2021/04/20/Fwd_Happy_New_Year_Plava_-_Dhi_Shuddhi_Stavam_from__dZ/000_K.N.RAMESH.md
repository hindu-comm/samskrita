Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. The Hindu year **Sharvari** is about to end and the year **Plava** is about to start on **14-Apr-2021 (Wednesday)**. **Sharvari** is perhaps the year we would like to obliterate from our memory as it brought the world to its knees with the pandemic with no sight of light or end of tunnel yet when the new year **Plava** starts.  

  

Lord's grace is the one and only thing that the humanity needs during this calamitous time! But to receive Lord's grace, one needs immutable faith and bhakti which is just not possible without purity of mind. And that comes only with the Grace of Lord! The attached prayer, an exquisite one, just beseeches the same with Lord.  

  

The attached prayer is taken from **Harivamsha Puranam** (last canto of the epic **Mahabharata**), **Bhavishya Parva** and **Chapter 80**. This Parva contains a detailed account of **Lord Krishna's** visit to **Mount Kailash** and mutual prayers of Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna on each other (I have shared one before). The attached hymn was sung by **Ghatakarna** who was with a ghostly physical manifestation. As usual, I have given a brief description of the prayer in the preface. In spite of being a ghost, Ghantakarna gets the divine vision of Lord Vishnu and attains liberation (explained in subsequent chapters).  

  

This hymn is very similar to the **Dhi Shuddhi Stotram** by **Sri Vadiraja** from Dvaita lineage. Another Dvaita seer, **Sri Vijayindra Tirtha** (Sri Raghavendra's Guru's Guru) has sung an elaborate prayer titled **Papa Vimochana stotram** and is said to be a potent prayer to cleanse oneself. Sri Vijayindra Tirtha's Brindavanam is in the heart of **Kumbakonam** town (Solaiyappan Street) and I have had the fortune of having darshan a few years ago. We can also draw parallel to the **Shatpadi Stotram** of **Sri Adi Shankara**.  

  

In the year Plava, the one and only wealth we can seek from Lord is His grace - all other maternal wealth is immaterial. May I take this occasion to wish you, your family and friends a very happy and prosperous New Year Plava through the Grace of Lord!

  

With best regards and Pranams,

K. Muralidharan Iyengar (Murali)
