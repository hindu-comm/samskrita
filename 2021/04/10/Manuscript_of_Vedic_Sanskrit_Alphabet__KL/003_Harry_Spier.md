This looks to me like an implementation of the unicode vedic extensions block (added to unicode standard I think about 2009).

This link from Wikipedia gives links to the pdfs of the Unicode standard working groups documents, where these various accents were discussed by vedic specialists.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_Extensions#History>  

  

If you click on the link"show" beside "versions" about the middle of the wepageit will expand and you will have links to all the discussions about these vedic accents.
