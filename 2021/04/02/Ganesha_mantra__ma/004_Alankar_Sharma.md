Hi,

  

In North India it is quite a popular dhyan for Ganesh. In all the Puja Vidhi's which usually starts with Ganesh Puja, this dhyan shlok is used. Wherever we do Ganesh Puja only (or when we do visheshrghya/ special Dhyan etc we use some stotra and not just this shlok).  
  

The mentioned line "कपित्थजम्बूफलचारुभक्षणम्", we speak as it is and which also has meaning, there might be other variations as well like suggested by Rev. Mohan ji.
