Some of the most beautiful Sanskrit names in our country are exclusively given among Bengalis. One such name is ‘Pathikrit’ (pathikṛt, पथिकृत्). Many of us would have read reports by the reporter Pathikrit Chakraborty in the Times of India. He is a young (around 30 years of age) political correspondent based in Lucknow. LinkedIn shows 172 results for the first name Pathikrit, and almost all of the top 50 results have a Bengali last name. We can safely conclude that the name is almost entirely given among Bengalis.

  
What does the name mean? The Sanskrit word ‘pathikṛt’ (पथिकृत्) literally means “a pathmaker”, i.e., a pioneer. One who makes a \[new\] path or way or \[new\] paths or ways is called ‘pathikṛt’ (पन्थानं पथो वा करोतीति पथिकृत्). The word comes from ‘pathin’ which means “a path, a road” and the root √‘kṛ’ which means “to do, to make”. For the rules involved in formation of the word, see note \[1\].

  
The word ‘pathikṛt’ is a Vedic word and epithet. It is used many a time in the Ṛgveda’s Śākala Saṃhitā for several deities and luminaries like Bṛhaspati (2.23.6), Indra (6.21.12 and 10.111.3), Soma (9.106.5), and ancient ‘ṛṣi’s (10.14.15). In the Atharvaveda’s Śaunaka Saṃhitā, the word is used for Agni and Soma (18.2.53) and the creators of the world (18.3.25–35). In the Atharvaveda’s Paippalāda Saṃhitā, Vaiśvānara is called ‘pathikṛt’ (5.6.7). In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (6.5.1), the word is used for ancient ‘ṛṣi’s. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (7.8.3) describes Agni as ‘pathikṛt’, and so does the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (1.4.4). In the Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra (2.14.9), the word is used for Pūṣaṇ. Macdonnel and Keith say that ‘pathikṛt’ is “not a rare” epithet, “showing clearly the importance naturally attached in primitive times to the finding of roads”.\[2\] But this is a purely literal reading of the word. Just like words like ‘pathadarśaka’ (पथदर्शक) mean not only one who shows the road but also one who leads or guides on the right path or way, a similar sense should be attached to ‘pathikṛt’. Sāyaṇa explains the word ‘pathikṛt’ as “\[the shower of\] the right path” (पथिकृत् सन्मार्गश्च भवसि, RV 2.23.6) or “the maker of the good path” (पथिकृद्भ्यः शोभनमार्गकारिभ्यः, RV 10.14.15), suggesting the sense is more metaphorical than literal. A ‘pathikṛt’ is one who creates a new “way” or “innovates”. The sense could be scientific, artistic, musical, philosophical, or spiritual; it need not be navigational alone. For example, when India sends a rover to Mars or a spacecraft to interstellar space, it could be named ‘pathikṛt’ (पथिकृत्), à la Mars Pathfinder.  
  

In the Mahābhārata’s Vana-parvan also, we come across the word ‘pathikṛt’ (verse 3.221.30: इष्टिरष्टाकपालेन कार्या पथिकृतेऽग्नये). Here, ‘pathikṛt’ refers to a special Agni to whom ‘iṣṭi’s are to be offered for incomplete Darśa or Paurṇamāsa ‘yāga’s.  
  

Pathikrit (‘pathikṛt’, पथिकृत्) is thus a beautiful Sanskrit name which means “a pathmaker, a pioneer” and refers to a special form of Agni mentioned in the Mahābhārata. The feminine form is also the same, viz. ‘pathikṛt’ (पथिकृत्), and so the name can be given to girls also.  
  

Notes:  
\[1\] The formation of the word is ‘pathin’ + √‘kṛ’ + \[kvip\] = ‘pathikṛt’ (पथिन् + √कृ + क्विप् = पथिकृत्). The suffix ‘kvip’, ordained in the sense of agent, is entirely elided by the rules 1.3.9 (तस्य लोपः) and 6.1.67 (वेरपृक्तस्य) of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The final ‘n’ of ‘pathin’ is elided by the rule 8.2.7 (नलोपः प्रातिपदिकान्तस्य) and the ‘t’ is added after ‘kṛ’ by the rule 6.1.71 (ह्रस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक्).
