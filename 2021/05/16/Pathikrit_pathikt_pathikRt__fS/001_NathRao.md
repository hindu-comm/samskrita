Another interesting fact: pathikRt and Latin pontifex are essentially the same word. \[For some reason, those who know Latin, but not IE linguistics seem to think that the word pontifex has something to do with actual bridge building, rather than taking it in a more metaphorical sense. Also, yes, pathi- and English path are cognate too.\]
