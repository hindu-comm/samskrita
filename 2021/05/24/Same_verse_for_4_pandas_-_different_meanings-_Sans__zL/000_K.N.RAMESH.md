[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari "Devanagari")  
विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणा विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणाः ।  
विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणा विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणाः ॥  

Four feet of the verse are the same but each foot has different meaning.  
  

"The arrows (*mārgaṇāḥ*), of the king (*jagatīśa*)*Arjuna*spread out (*vikāśam īyuḥ*). The arrows (*mārgaṇāḥ*), of the lord of the earth (*jagatīśa*) \[i.e. Śiva\], spread out (*vikāśam īyuḥ*). The*Gaṇa*s (gaṇāḥ) who are the slayers of demons (*jagatīśamār*) rejoiced (*vikāśam īyuḥ*). The seekers (*mārgaṇāḥ*) of*Śiva*(*jagatīśa*) \[i.e. the deities and sages\], reached (*īyuḥ*) the sky (*vikāśam*) \[to watch the battle\].
