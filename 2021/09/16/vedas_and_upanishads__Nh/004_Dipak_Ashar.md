Vadhiraj ji ,

  

Thanks for your suggestion. I have to find a Guru who can teach and explain. Till then , I will attempt to read from these books prescribed or Adi Shankaracharyaji's books.

  

If there are any suggestions please let me know

  

i have recently come across lecture series from Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune and Lectures by Dr Sucheta Paranjape . e g " From Vedas to Vedanta "<https://youtu.be/I-58tV3Lq3Q>  on youtube . But I also wanted to read the complete works from the books .

  

regards

  

Dipak.
