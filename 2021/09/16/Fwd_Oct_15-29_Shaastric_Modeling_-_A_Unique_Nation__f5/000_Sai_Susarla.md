namassarvebhyaH,

For contemporary academic discourse to be enriched with bharatiya knowledge-based insight, Her traditional thought needs to be collated across multiple shaastras, distilled and paraphrased into a form intelligible to non-traditional academic & scientific community. **Shaastras need to be presented as coherent scientific models** that can be evaluated side-by-side with contemporary models of various subjects.  

  

However, traditional knowledge as available to us and studied by scholars in shaastra granthas is not always in a form that is readily consumable by today's audience trained in a context often different from the original one. Hence we believe the need of the hour is to bridge this semantic gap and empower our young shaastra scholars to participate, innovate and lead in contemporary academics.  

  

Over the past few years, under the guidance of stalwart scholars including Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi, Prof. Nagaraj Paturi and Prof. V.N. Jha, [MITADT School of Vedic Sciences Pune](http://mitvedicsciences.edu.in) has been experimenting with ways to bridge this gap and inculcate **shaastriya-chintanam, a step beyond shaastra-adhyayanam**.  

  

Based on the lessons learnt, [MITSVS](http://mitvedicsciences.edu.in) is excited to announce [**Shaastric Modeling**](https://mitvedicsciences.edu.in/shaastric-modeling-fdp/), a first-of-its-kind National workshop series in technology collaboration with [Vedavaapi Foundation](http://vedavaapi.org) and academic collaboration with some leading Sanskrit Universities - [CSU Prayagraj](https://gnjhacampusrsks.org/), [KKSU Ramtek](http://kksu.org/) and [KSU Bangalore](http://ksu.ac.in/en/).

The workshop offers hands-on training to **impart the following new skills** for Shaastra vidwans to spur innovative shaastra-based contributions to the world’s knowledge. The aspects covered in this program are:

-   **Shaastra Mapping –**pictorially representing a shaastra grantha’s
    discourse**  
    ** -   **Shaastra Mining –**answering complex questions on a shaastra
    authentically.**  
    ** -   **Shaastric Modeling –**applying shaastric thinking to bring a
    fresh perspective to modern academic disciplines.

With these skills, the participant will become eligible to participate in Applied Shaastra projects at various institutions guided by MITSVS and Vedavaapi.org. We are happy to report that KKSU and KSU are embarking on projects for Shaastra mapping of Jyotisha, Vaastu, Vyakarana and Yoga texts.
