At the end of any karma while offering dakshina to the priest the following mantra is chanted.

  

हिरण्यगर्भ गर्भस्थं हेमभीजंविभावसो: अनन्ततपुण्यफलदंअत: शान्तिं प्रयच्छ मे । And after describingthe karma which has been done, it is said आचार्याय तुभ्यमहं संप्रतते।

  

In this I am unable to understand the grammar (dhatu and pratyaya) and meaning of the word संप्रतते .

  

Please help me.

  

धन्यवाद:

  

गणपति
