Gita Shikshana Kendram (Samskrit through Bhagavadgita)

  

Learn Samskrit, learn the Gita, practice Yoga, live Vedanta…. ….all this through a single, novel learning package that is neither taxing nor boring!

four-level course called Gita Shikshana Kendram (गीता-शिक्षण-केन्द्रम्‌) offers you an entirely new technique, method and approach to learning the Geeta. This one course will give you access to four key domains—Samskrit, the Gita, Yoga and Vedanta.

  

1. Gita Sopanam Part I.

2. Gita Sopanam Part II.

3. Gita Pravesha Part I.

4. Gita Pravesha Part II.

  

On completion of these four levels, you will not only be able to read and understand the Bhagavad-gita text all by yourself, but also become a Samskrit speaker and writer.

  

Sri Krishna offered the Gita to Arjuna through conversation.

You too will learn it through conversation!.

You too will learn the language of Sri Krishna!
