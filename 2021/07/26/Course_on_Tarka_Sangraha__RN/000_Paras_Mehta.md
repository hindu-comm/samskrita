The Tarka-saṅgraha of Annambhaṭṭa is considered to be the primer for studying the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika discipline. The author Annambhaṭṭa has explained the categories and concepts of Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika in an easily understandable way for the beginners in this discipline.

The book delineates the seven categories of padārthas: dravya (substance), guṇa (quality), karma (action), sāmānya (pervasiveness), viśeṣa (particularity), samavāya (inherence), and abhāva (absence).

In doing so, it delineates the subcategories as well, such as the nine types of dravyas, their characteristics, etc., the 24 guṇas and their characteristics, and so on.

It also describes the means of knowledge: pratyakṣa (direct sensory perception), anumāna (inference), upamāna (comparison) and śabda (verbal testimony). In doing so, it describes in detail the types of pratyakṣa, the process of anumāna, the constituents of anumāna, the process of understanding through śabda, etc.

Objectives:

1\) To train the students to think analytically and logically. This is useful in constructing arguments for defending the concepts that one subscribes to.

2\) To acquaint the students with the categories of Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika that are frequently resorted to by ācāryas of other disciplines in their own texts.

3\) To acquaint the students with the constituents of the pramāṇas. In order to gain valid knowledge, it is necessary to be well versed with the means of gaining knowledge.

Method of Teaching: The Tarka-saṅgraha will be taught with the help of the author’s own commentary, the Tarka-saṅgraha-dīpikā, the commentary Padakṛtya by Candraja-siṁha, and occasionally the Nyāya-bodhinī of Govardhana. The teacher will refer to the original texts and explain them.

Classes will be conducted online through the Zoom platform.

Duration: The course will span over 55 classes of one hour each. Each class will also have time for questions and answers. Classes will be conducted twice a week.

Fees: Rs. 8,400/- per student

Classes will commence only after 14 participants have registered.

If more than 14 students register then the individual fees will be decreased accordingly.

Tentative date for the beginning of the course is 16-August-2021.
