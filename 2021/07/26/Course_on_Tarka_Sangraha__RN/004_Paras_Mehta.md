**A Course on Tarka Sangraha**

The Tarka-sangraha of Annambhatta is considered to be the primer for studying the Nyaya-Vaisesika discipline. The author Annambhatta has explained the categories and concepts of Nyāya-Vaisesika in an easily understandable way for the beginners in this discipline.

The book delineates the seven categories of padārthas: dravya (substance), guna (quality), karma (action), samanya (pervasiveness), visesa (particularity), samavaya (inherence), and abhava (absence).

In doing so, it delineates the subcategories as well, such as the nine types of dravyas, their characteristics, etc., the 24 gunas and their characteristics, and so on.

It also describes the means of knowledge: pratyaksa (direct sensory perception), anumana (inference), upamana (comparison) and sabda (verbal testimony). In doing so, it describes in detail the types of pratyaksa, the process of anumana, the constituents of anumana, the process of understanding through sabda, etc.

Objectives:

1\) To train the students to think analytically and logically. This is useful in constructing arguments for defending the concepts that one subscribes to.

2\) To acquaint the students with the categories of Nyaya-Vaisesika that are frequently resorted to by ācāryas of other disciplines in their own texts.

3\) To acquaint the students with the constituents of the pramānas. In order to gain valid knowledge, it is necessary to be well versed with the means of gaining knowledge.

Method of Teaching: The Tarka-sangraha will be taught with the help of the author’s own commentary, the Tarka-saṅgraha-dipikā, the commentary Padakrtya by Candraja-simha, and occasionally the Nyaya-bodhini of Govardhana. The teacher will refer to the original texts and explain them.

Classes will be conducted online through the Zoom platform.

**Duration:** The course will span over 55 classes of one hour each. Each class will also have time for questions and answers.

Classes will be conducted twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays, 7 PM to 8 PM (Indian time).

**Fees:** Rs. 8,400/- per student

Classes will commence only after 14 participants have registered.

The tentative date for the beginning of the course is 16-August-2021.
