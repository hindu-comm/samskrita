Dear Mr Ganapathy,

Pranaam,

  

The classes will be twice aweek, preferably Mondays and Wednesdays. The timings of the classes would be 7 PM to 8 PM IST. I would prefer to have the classes in the mornings, but most people would be busy with their work, etc. during that time. That is why I have kept the timings in the evenings.  
The days of the week can be adjusted depending upon the convenience of the majority of participants.

All the classes will be recorded, and the recordings would be made available to all registered participants. Thus, they will not miss out if they are unable to attend the live classes.  
  
Please let me know if youhave any further queries.

Thank you.

  

Best regards,

Paras Mehta
