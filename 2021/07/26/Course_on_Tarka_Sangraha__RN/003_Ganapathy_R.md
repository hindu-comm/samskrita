Pranam Mahodaya,

  

Thank you very much for yourprompt reply. I would also prefer morning timings because I teach Sanskrit and Vedanta in the evenings. But I do not have any classeson Monday. So that is not an issue. I have a class on Wednesday from 5 to 6 pm and after that I do my evening prayers. So I should be able to make it from 7 to 8 PM. Of course, if it had been Thursday it would have been more convenient since I don't have any class on Thursdays also.

  

In any case, when you finalize the programme please let me know.

  

Thanks and Om

  

Ganapathy
