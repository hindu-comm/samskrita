Dear vidvaj-janas.

  

With great pleasure, I am submitting the Janma-divasa-pañcakam. This set of five verses composed in the 'Toṭakam' meter have been composed for the occasion of the birthday of any Gauḍīya vaiṣṇava or vaiṣṇavī.

  
These verses have been written in a way that is institution-neutral. Thus, Gauḍīya-vaiṣṇavas belonging to all institutions, branches and sub-branches of the paramparā can sing these verses. Since the meter for all these verses is 'Toṭakam', one can look up existing songs in this meter and can use the same tune for these verses. Popular songs written in the Toṭakam meter are — Madhurāṣṭakam (1st verse), Toṭakāṣṭakam etc.

  

For those who wish to see the word-for-word for the five verses or print them, i am including PDF's of a devanagari version (with Hindi translation) and roman version (with English translation) as attachments to this message.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,  

  

hari parshad das. \_/\\ò\_
