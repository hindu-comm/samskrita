In the beginning he took 15 flowers with him. See below:

He took  15  14.  12.  8

  

Double   30  28.  24. 16

  

Gave     16. 16.  16. 16

  

Balance  14. 12.   8.  0

  

  

If he takes 30 and gives 32 or any multiples of these then also the answer is correct.

  

प्रथम पूजा अवशिष्टं व्यत्यासः

  

 15.      16    1

 30.      32.    2

 45.      48.    3

 60.      64.    4

 75.      80.    5

 90.      96.    6

105.     112.   7

120.     128.   8

135.     144.   9

150.     160.   10

  

This pattern may be infinite... also the possibility of any different combination is to be explored.
