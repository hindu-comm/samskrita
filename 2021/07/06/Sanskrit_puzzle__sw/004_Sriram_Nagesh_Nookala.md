To systematically make it, let's start with :  
Assume he bought X flowers.  
Assume he offered Y flowers.

Every time he dips them in the Water they double. So the equation will be to repeat (2X-Y) four times because he did it 4 times. The equation now becomes:  
2(2(2(2X-Y) - Y) -Y) -Y) = 0

16X - 15Y = 0

So X = 15 (or multiple of 15s) and

Y is 16 (or multiple of 16).

  

Now instead of 4 temples the number becomes N.. Then, it will be 2^N-1 & 2^N;
