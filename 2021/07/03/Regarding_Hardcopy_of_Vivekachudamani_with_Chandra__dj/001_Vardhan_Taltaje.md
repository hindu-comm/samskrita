Sir, Please check with Vedanta Bharati. They have published Vivekachudamani with Sanskrit commentary by Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Mahaswamiji, (both original text and commentary in Devanagari script), with translations in Kannada.  

  

Here is that item from their website: <http://vedantabharati.org/product/vivekachudamani>. You may contact them at <http://vedantabharati.org/contact-us>. If you are in Bangalore, you may be able to pick up a copy from their office given in the contact page.  

  

Regards,

Vardhan
