Namaskar to All!

  

I am in search of a verse that is used in Chanakya Serial - Episode No 42 in the last when the episode finished and credits are going on. The link to the Episode is given below:-

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbt-miQrn30>

  

What I am able to listen is something like:-

  

अभयं ध्यावा पृथ्वी इहावस्तु नोभयं सोमः सविता न गृणोऽतु

अभयं नोस्तुअँतरिक्षं सप्तर्षि नां च हविषाभयं नोस्तु।

  

May I get the exact verse and source of the verse with meaning???

  

Regards,

Om
