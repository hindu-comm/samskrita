I had the same problem, even though I have not tried to compose documents that three languages (Tamil, Sanskrit and English). My current needs are only Sanskrit and English.

After trying different keyboard layouts based on recommendations and not being happy with any of them, I decided to create my own keyboard layout for Sanskrit.  

I also have a keyboard layout for Tamil, but currently it is not well-integrated with the Sanskrit layout - in the sense of there being some inconsistency in the layout between the two.

  

Ignoring the very top row that has keys marked F1, F2, ... etc. the keyboard can be thought of having for rows of keys.

\- first row (top row) is numbers and punctuation marks

\- second row has keys labeled, starting from left, Q, W, E, R, T, Y ... etc.

\- third row has keys labeled, starting from left, A, S, D, F, G, ...

\- fourth row (last row) has keys labeled, starting from left, Z, X, C, V, B, ... etc

  

The second row (QWERTY row) has 13 keys.

When shift key is pressed, Q, W, E, R, T ... are mapped to the vowels (अ आ इ ई ...), respectively

When shift key is not pressed, these keys map to vowel forms that are used when following consonant (् ा ि ी ...)

  

The third row (ASDF row) has 11 keys and is dedicated to the क-वर्प, च-वर्ग, ट-वर्ग, त-वर्ग, and प-वर्ग (स्पर्शाः). One key is unused.

ASDFG are mapped to hard consonants, both non-aspirate and aspirate.

;LKJH are mapped to soft consonants, both non-aspirate and aspirate.

The left and the right hand are mirror image in terms of mapping to different वर्ग-s.

  

The last row is dedicated to अनुनासिक, अन्तघःस्थ,उष्मन्, विसर्ग, अनुस्वार, अवग्रह, विराम etc.

  

I am happy to share my layout with anybody that is interested.
