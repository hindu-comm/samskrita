Hi,  
  
I am looking for an effective platform for composing/editing Sanskrit  
documents along with English/Tamil translations on PC/Laptop. By a  
platform, I mean the combination of operating system (Windows/Linux),  
the input system (Phonetic keyboard or Unicode or ITRANS kind of  
system). I have tried composing with XeXeTex and Polyglossia and that  
seems to be a good choice. However, the input management and editing  
appear to be a tough chore with Phonetic as well as ITRANS kind of systems.  
  
I would appreciate insights into this from those who do text composition  
in Sanskrit regularly.  
  
Thanks in advance,  
  
- Narasimhan
