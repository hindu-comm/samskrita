Dear Narasimhan Swamin:

You can use any OS — Windows, Linux, MacOS. All of them support Samskritam and Tamil. The key is to select the right keyboard from the system options. For samskritam, choose the devanagiri keyboard.

  

Then select the right font. Samskritam documents can use the Kashmiri style font or the Bengal style fonts. They may be called by other names, but that is what I am familiar with.

Raja is a kashmiri style font that represents ‘a’ and ṇa as asअ and ण

While the same character displays in the Siddhanta font shows up as अ and ण

So please select the right font.

  

Then comes you purpose. Do you want to publish your writings as ebooks? Then you would need an open source font that you can embed and distribute with your documents. I use the ‘siddhanta’ font and have no trouble creating epubs. You can visit either google play store or Apple iBooks store and search for ‘Raja Srinivasan’ — you will get an idea of what I am talking about.

  

But be aware that not all platforms support bold and italics. So you need to experiment. I use Apple Pages and in this platform, Siddhanta font does not support bold and italics.

  

Then figure out how to use the keyboard. There are keyboard maps available online. You need to experiment.

First select the keyboard from the system menu (on the top of the screen on my mac and usually on the bottom of the screen on windows). Select the devanigiri keyboard and you can now type in samskritam. For example if you want to type प्र, you would type ‘p’, then ‘f’ so you get the half प् . Then you type the ‘r’ to get the ‘pra’ syllable. By selecting other keyboards you can type in other languages, thereby creating a mixed document, or a document with multiple languages.

  

I am trying out various tamil fonts. They work the same way. But so far have not fixed on any particular tamil font.

  

For vedic swaras, you would need to use an unicode keyboard with hex-input. For example to get the lower द, I selected the devanagiri keyboard, then typed in a lower-case d, to get the द. Then selected the unicode keyboard while keeping the option key pressed, typed in 009 to get the underline feature for the word द.

  

If you can figure out an easy to use tamil font that displays well on your system please let me know.

  

One thing to note, I use a line spacing of 1.5 and a font size of 14, so that the samskritam characters shows up well. One have to remember that in samskritam you can have multiple half-syllables that can be written in a single space. For instance, ङ्ग.‘inga’. If you use the default font size of 12, it makes reading very difficult.

  

Hope this helps.

  

Thanks & Regards  
Raja Srinivasan
