Hari Om:

Thanks a lot for all your inputs.

I found a neat solution to the input management issue - there is a Devnagari keyboard (INSCRIPT) made by TVS Electronics which I could buy on Amazon India - here is the link: <https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01BI0JAQA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1>

This solves the problem of having to either look at the onscreen keyboard in Windows or keep a print out of the keymaps (or stickers on US English keyboard) to do the input.

I have not tested all combinations with this keyboard - looks like this should do the job. Of course, I need to constantly look at the keyboard and type till the key positions become muscle memory !

\- Narasimhan
