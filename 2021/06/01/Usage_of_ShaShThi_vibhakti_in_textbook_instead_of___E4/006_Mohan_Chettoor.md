Vijay, I can understand your concern and confusion.

First of all please understand that षष्ठि विभक्ति is used (among other things) to show/ express a feeling or condition. If you want to say ' I have a headache' in Sanskrit, you say 'मम शिरोवेदना अस्ति।' usingषष्ठि विभक्ति.

Being a kannadiga, you are fully justified in your confusion regarding chaturthee vibhakthi. May be because that is the way you express in your mother tongue. I am a keralite and the same issue is there in Malayalam as well. Though I don't have authority to speak about other Indian languages, I believe many, if not most of them would have the same issue.

Believe me, you can't use chaturthee, my dear friend, unless some hardcore pundit corrects me otherwise.

Mohan Chettoor.

And b
