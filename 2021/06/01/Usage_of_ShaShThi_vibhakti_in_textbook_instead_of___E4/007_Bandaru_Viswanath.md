Please consider that in your language, the daily usage of the vibhaktis may have deviated from the language rules. In my mother tongue (Telugu), the vibhakti rules are identical to those of sanskrit, but the vibhakti suffixes are not being adhered to these days, and thus the mapping to Sanskrit becoming an issue.
