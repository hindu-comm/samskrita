Regarding the question of if there is a difference in how (dative) chaturthii is used, there is a difference between Sanskrit and Kanada: I don't know Kannada, but there is certainly a difference between Tamil and Sanskrit: Inalienable possession is indicated in Tamil using -kku (dative), but not in Sanskrit. He has a son" in Tamil is "avannakku paiyan irrukiRaan", but I have never seen "tasmai putro 'sti", only "tasya putro 'sti". \[But then, people have been importing the syntax of their first language into Sanskrit for 1000+ years, so feel free do more of the same:-^)\]
