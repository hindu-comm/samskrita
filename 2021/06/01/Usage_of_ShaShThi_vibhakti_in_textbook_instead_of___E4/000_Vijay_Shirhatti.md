I am studying for Pravesha Sanskrit Bharati exam: Please consider these sentences below.

  

As given in text book: **काकस्य**अतीवसन्तोषःभवति

Shouldn't this be, **काकः** अतीवसन्तोषःभवति ***or*****काकाय** अतीवसन्तोषःभवति  

  

I feel चतुर्थि will get the meaning right when I translate in Kannada.

Thanks in advance.
