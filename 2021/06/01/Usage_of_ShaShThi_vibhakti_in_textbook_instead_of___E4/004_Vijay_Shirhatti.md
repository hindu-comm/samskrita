Kindy bear with me, I am trying to understand. I still have questions:

  

Thanks all for nice explanation. How about usingचतुर्थि विभक्ति? It does sound correct in Kannada using चतुर्थि विभक्ति.

  

मोहनमहोदय

"षष्ठिto indicate possession". Do we consider 'happiness' to be in possession in Sanskrit? We can say "काकस्यफलम्", because Kaka is in actual possession of a fruit. But happiness is to be felt right?  

वैष्णविमहोदया

"काकःअतीवसन्तोषःभवतिmeans kaka himself is happiness", thanks for this explanation. I now understand. Kaka is himself not happiness, he 'feels' happy. But still some questions remain in my head.  

  

Ifषष्ठि विभक्ति has to be used, it can be used in a sentence likeकाकःजलंपश्यति \|काकस्यसन्तोषःद्विगुणःभवति \| This one makes more sense to me.

I translate all the sentences into Kannada, is there a difference in how we useविभक्तिin Kannada and in Sanskrit?
