Namaste.

  

Why notकाकायअतीवसन्तोषःभवति?

  

चतुर्थीविभक्तिin sanskrit is used generally in following senses

यस्मैदीयतेतद्वाचकस्यशब्दस्य।In the action of giving, to whom that is given, getsचतुर्थीविभक्ति.

-   Eg-ब्राह्मणायगांददातिराजा।

The purpose ofक्रियाperformed getsचतुर्थीविभक्ति.

-   Eg-मोक्षायहरिंभजति। -   Hereभजनक्रियाis performed for the purpose ofमोक्ष.
    Soमोक्षशब्दgetsचतुर्थीविभक्ति.

In actions that involve movement (from one place to another place), the object of action (the destination of movement) getsचतुर्थीविभक्तिalso (otherwise it getsद्वितीयाविभक्ति), when there is movement (not when there is no movement as in - he goes to Tirupati in his mind).

-   Eg-रामःग्रामायगच्छति।(it can also be -रामःग्रामंगच्छति।)

  

चतुर्थीविभक्तिis also used in some other specific cases, as inहरयेनमः,हरयेभक्तिःरोचतेetc.

  

  

In our exampleकाकस्यअतीवसन्तोषःभवति,काकis used in none of the above senses. Therefore it doesn’t getचतुर्थीविभक्ति.

  

Dhanyavadah.
