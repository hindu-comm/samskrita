Dear Scholars,

I have come across a beautiful Nirajana on Sri Lalita Parameshwari(Source : [SanskritDocs](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/lalitAmbAnIrAjanam.html)).

  

जय देवि!, जय देवि!, जय सुन्दरि तनये!, जय सुन्दरि ललिते! ।

शश्वद्-वसतिं कुरु भोरीश्वरि! मम हृदये ॥ जय देवि!, जगदम्ब!।  

  

This rhythm is very famous across india for Bhajans. But I am unable to get the chandas(Metre) for this hymn \[I am sure that it must have one\]. So please help.

  

Also I thought there are few errors, so please help me regarding the source of this hymn.

  

Also I am planning to make a site for digitalizing lalita sahastranama (name wise) along with soubhagya bhaskara bhasya , Soundarya lahari with LaxmiDhara Tika.

But I am unable to find the Tika in digitalized version(archive has scanned version), So I would be grateful if any source regarding it is provided...

  

Thank you..,

Adarsh
