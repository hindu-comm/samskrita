Thank you all *Vidvajjana*-s.

  

I have understood the second and fourth *Pāda*-s in this way:

  

*Puṇḍra*means holy traditional mark made on the forehead of*Vaiṣṇava-*s, *Śaiva-*s etc. This mark enhances the majestical form of the face and creates divine beauty . It does not harm anything. Likewise,*Āgama* does not trouble any letter. But it sits beside the letter like *Pu**ṇḍ**ra*.

*Chatra*(umbrella) is spread widely on the head of the leader to show his supremacy. *Pratyaya*-s distinguish the word (from other words) after which they are added.
