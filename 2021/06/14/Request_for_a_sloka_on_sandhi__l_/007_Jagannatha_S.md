Apologies for the wrong interpretation.

  

(*Chatra*(umbrella) is spread widely on the head of the leader to show his supremacy.*Pratyaya*-s distinguish the word (from other words) after which they are added-This is wrong interpretation.)

  

Most probably following is the intended idea of comparison:

  

*Chatra* can not be utilized without a person.

Likewise,*Pratyaya* can not be used separately without word.
