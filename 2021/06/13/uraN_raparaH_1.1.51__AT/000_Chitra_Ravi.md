Namaste

  

Please clarify the following

How the sutramउरण् रपरः १.१.५१

is deciphered for  

Gunasandhi's

अ/आ + ऌ‌ -- अल्

  

Please explain for the first part alone - that is for उः alone (षष्ठी-एकवचनम्)

I can understand that theषष्ठी-एकवचनम् for ऋकारान्तः is उः

However it is not the case for ऌ

  

The षष्ठी एकवचनम for ऌकारनतः isअल्

  

Please find attached the screenshot forऌकारनतः

  

Please explain how "उः" is translated for "ऌ"

  

Thanks and regards

Chitra
