Respected scholars in the group,

About ऋ, the seventh vowel in Sanskrit VarNamala. Longuists define it as a retroflex approximant, a consonant. What is then the justification in still including it the list of vowels when we are not able to produce this sound as a vowel like we are able to produce the vowel sounds अ आ इ उ etc.

Is definition of vowel different in Sanskrit?
