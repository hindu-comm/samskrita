It's a rough thing to explain in modern terms, Shreyas, because there is a different conditioning around what constitutes a "sound", that is to say, a "vowel". As you probably already know, the order of the vowels in Sanskrit has long ago been defined by the order from the back of the vocal apparatus (i.e., the back of the throat) towards the front. Try sounding out the long "u", the " ऋ " as a trill formed with the lips partly open, and then the "e" - you'll find that the "e" is formed just by opening the lips a little bit more. What this all means is that ऋ is a trill, which was obviously considered a sound - a vowel - by itself at the time that Sanskrit was first recorded in writing. Once again, reciters of Sanskrit of a more recent day (centuries, maybe? --- who knows how long the tendency has been around?) have difficulty with pronouncing a trill as a sound by itself, and developed the tendency to pronounce some short sound after it: there are different schools of thought about this India itself. Some say that it is ऋ + a short "i", some that it is ऋ + a short "u" - the fact is that, if a trill is followed by any sound, it is represented by a different character in the script (the character for consonantal "ra"). So when you ask, is the definition of vowel different in Sanskrit, I'd answer that, perhaps it is more accurate to say that the original Sanskrit speakers, etc. had/used vowels other than the ones we recognize in most of today's languages, and that "ऋ" is one of them.
