Sanskrit has ऋ in the positions of vowel , for example, as a word beginner followed by a consonant

  

ऋतुः , ऋषिः , ऋणम्‌ etc.

  

If this is the same as र्‌ ,

  

we must have र्+ consonant in the beginning of a word.

  

But we do not have such a phonemic distribution in Sanskrit words.

  

The ऋ in the beginning of Sanskrit words behaves like a vowel in Guna sandhi and Vriddhi changes.

  

महा+ ऋषिः = महर्षिः

ऋषिः \> आर्षम्‌

This is not howर् behaves.

Finally ,

a consonant clustered with a followingऋ, like a consonant followed by a vowel , does not create weighton the preceding syllable in Chandas /prosody.

प्रकृतिःis UII

like

प्रकितिः, प्रकुतिः

unlike

प्रक्रुतिः

which is UUI

Thus prodically/metrically alsoऋ is behaving like vowels, not like consonants.
