महोदय श्रेयन्,

  

It becomes clear if the principles behind that is understood.

  

**स्वयं राजते स्वराः,** इति उच्यते खलु। Now, what does it exactly mean?

-   स्वराः can be pronounced for as long as possible and a listener can
    identify the swara even if it is heard partially.  
-   Ex, If I pronounce the swara ईऽऽ continuously, if you start hearing
    from 3rd second, not from the start, even then you can recognise
    that I am pronouncing the ई sound.  
-   व्यञ्जनानि cannot exist on their own but need स्वराः । -   Ex, if I pronounce कीऽऽ continuously, and you hear from the 3rd
    second, you will only hear me say ई. That is because the ककारः has
    its existence only during the initial short period. -   So the व्यञ्जनानि do not have a life of their own. They are
    sometimes referred to as Dirac Delta Functions.

  

Can we then say व्यञ्जनानि स्वयं न राजन्ते ?  

-   No. -   Though the above is true for most consonants, there are two व्यञ्जने
    who can very well have life of their own. They are not necessarily
    Dirac Delta Functions.  
-   They are रकारः & लकारः -   To test that, pronounce र्ऽऽ continoiusly without adding any अ, इ, उ
    ए or ओ. You will see that it is indeed possible. -   Unlike the rest of the व्यञ्जनानि, the र्-कारः & ल्-कारः can indeed
    exist in continuous time domain without the above vowels.
-   They behave like vowels.

तस्मात्,

**र**कार-**ल**कारयोः कालायामरूपे स्वरौ उच्येते । रकारस्य कालयामरूपं **ऋकारः** इति, लकारस्य कालयामरूपं **ऌकारः** इति च उच्यते।  

  

If those two are स्वरौ, can they be added to other व्यञ्जनानि?

-   Yes, that is what is "कृ" & "कॢ" -   Like with other vowels, we can have ह्रस्वरूपं, दीर्घरूपं or the
    longer प्लुतरूपम्

इति सदरम्,

\- सुदर्शनः
