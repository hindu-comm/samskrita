Namaste

  

The English translation of the bhashyam of Shri Shri Chandrasekhara Bharathi is available in book form with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. I think it is available on Amazon. Just found the link<https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Samkaras-VIVEKACUDAMANI-Chandrasekharendra-Bharati/dp/8172764200>.

  

I am curious as to where you got the Sanskrita book with the original bhashyam . I have been looking for it. I have access online but needed the book.

  

Thank you
