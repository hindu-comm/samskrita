I often observe that most of the Sanskrit Teachers (and of course the Sanskrit Learners trained by them) from the Northern Belt, especially from the Hindi-speaking areas, pronounce 'राम' as 'Ram' instead of 'Rama' which is totally incorrect. They might not be aware of the fact that Sanskrit is 'अजन्त भाषा' (Vowel-ending Language) whereas Hindi is
'हलन्त भाषा' (Consonant-ending Language). Therefore, there is a need to train them towards correct pronunciation of the Sanskrit words,
especially those words end in the (short) 'अ' Vowel.  
  

Similarly, people (including Sanskrit Teachers) from the Southern Belt are seen pronouncing 'श' 'sa' instead of 'sha'. For example, 'श्री' as
 'Srii' instead of 'Shrii'.  
  

It may not be out of place to mention that people from other parts of our country, viz., Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal, etc. pronounce the letters 'श', 'ष', 'स' etc. in a different way.  
  
As such, all these aspects are to be made clear to the people, especially to the Sanskrit Teaches of the respective areas mentioned above, in the interest of the Sanskrit Language, by way of organizing online Workshops.
