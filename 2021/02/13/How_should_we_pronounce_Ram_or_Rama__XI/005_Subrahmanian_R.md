Certain usages have come to stay.

Can we change the name Jag Jivan Ram as Jaga Jivana Rama in ordinary use. Even in Andhra Pradesh, the name सुधाकर for example is as such in Telugu but transliterated into English as Sudhakar.

Even talking of pure Sanskrit, consider the nama ramyana which is in Sanskrit

शुद्ध ब्रह्म परात्पर राम and each line ending राम - even in South India the final अ is not pronounced. The final अ is pronounced in all other words in this nama ramayana, but not for the word राम. It is so in the rendering by Smt M.S. Subbulakshmi also.

  

The influence of local/ regional language on one's pronunciation of Sanskrit or a foreign language will be there inevitably. अरविन्द is aravindan for a tamilian, arvind for UP and aurobindo for a Bengali. It is the same Sanskrit word. In Pondicherry we have auroville - the village of Aravinda.

  

Just as North Indians find it difficult or impossible to pronounce the final अ, South Indians have difficulty in ending words in a consonant. The last word प्रचोदयात् is pronounced with a mild vowel ending (குற்றியலுகரம்) in Tamil Nadu and with a distinct उ in Andhra Pradesh. It is so in English words also - caru, bassu, rayilu, eightu, ninu, tennu etc.

  

With respects
