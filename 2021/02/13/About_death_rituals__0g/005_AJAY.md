Thanks Jagannatha Ji. PV Kane has covered an extensive area of the Antyeshti and the after-death rituals in the mourning period as the West considers it.Thank you Nagraj Ji for the links of Dharma Sindhu and Nirnaya Sindhu. Both of the books cover other rituals and are essential because they help understand holistically. Thanks
