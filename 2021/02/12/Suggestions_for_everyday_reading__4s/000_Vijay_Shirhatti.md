Hi all, I have been reading two chapters of the Bhagavad Gita everyday with Youtube channel (<https://youtu.be/E53GuZ8NFQw>) as a background recitation. It has been working very well for me and enjoying every bit of it. I have read and finished the book a number of times now.

  

I wish to continue to do this with other adhyatmic literature. Kindly suggest some great books which I could include in my reading. I am thinking on Vivekachudamani. I don't wish to go into the Ramayana with 24000 shlokas yet (or similarly long books).

Thanks

Vijay Shirhatti
