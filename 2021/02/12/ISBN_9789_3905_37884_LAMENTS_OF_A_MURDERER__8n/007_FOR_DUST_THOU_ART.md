Greetings!

  

The point about the visarga is that it is only a breath following the vowel before it, so, as far as pronunciation is concerned, it doesn't make a difference what vowel is before it: the pronouncer is simply going to let out a breath after pronouncing the vowel before the visarga. As I mentioned before, through the ages, as languages were changing in many respects, this became a difficult thing for Sanskrit reciters to do: it has, for many ages, no longer been a feature of many languages derived from Sanskrit to simply let out a breath after a final vowel, and this is likely how the tendency to have to/want to repeat the vowel before the visarga developed. It is simply not an intuitive feature of speech in today's world, to simply let out a breath after a sound (a vowel) without pronouncing a sound (a vowel) after it.

  

Hope this helps!

  

Amalia
