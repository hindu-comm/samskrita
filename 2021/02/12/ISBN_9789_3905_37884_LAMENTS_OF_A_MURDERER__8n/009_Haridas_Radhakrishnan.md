That is why I said that you have Aha, ihi, uhu etc only in isolation, with no word following it, like at the end of a sentence.

  

Before प,फ we have a panini rule where the immediately preceding visarga becomes a अर्धविसर्ग: called उपध्मानीयः । This Half visarga , is specially called out by panini, and hence will have a different pronunciation than the full visarga, and it sounds like a silent F, where we blow out the breath silently.

  

By reverse inference, the full visarga will NOT sound like the half visarga.
