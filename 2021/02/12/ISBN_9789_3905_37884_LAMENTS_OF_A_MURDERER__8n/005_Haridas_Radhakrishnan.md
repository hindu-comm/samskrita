If you want to pronounce नमः with just a breathing sound , an expulsion of air at the end, that opportunity will only come before the letters क/ख , or at the end of a sentence. There is also a clear and full pronunciation of the visarga before the conjunct consonant क्ष .

  

Traditional teaching is that the visarga is an echo of the vowel preceding it, Aha, ihi, Uhu, Ehe, Oho, औhu, ऐhi .  

  

If at the end of a sentence, you just expel air without echoing the अ, it can be hard for someone a bit further away from you to hear that expulsion of air clearly.

  

Amalia talks about other indo-european languages, but as far as I know, even in Attic Greek, no one knows today exactly HOW the breathing was pronounced. Samskrtam is the most preserved language as far as pronunciation goes, especially with respect to the chanting of the Vedas. Besides, those languages are those languages, and samskrtam is samskrtam. For example, the Cerebrals and dentals in samskrtam are lost in Latin/Greek. Then should we assume they were actually there in those languages based on the fact that samskrtam is an indo European language, as they say?

  

I would rather go with the traditional teaching than invent new methods of pronunciation based on scanty and in many cases, imagined evidence.

  

With respects
