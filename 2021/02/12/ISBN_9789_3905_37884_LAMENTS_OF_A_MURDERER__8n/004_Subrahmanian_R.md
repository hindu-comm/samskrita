I think the visarga is pronounced differently depending on the preceding vowel - with an a ending after a, (राम:), with 'i' ending after i, ai हरि:, शनै:, with an u ending after u or au गुरु:. To the extent I have heard, this is how I have heard people generally pronounce.

  

Is the visarga to be pronounced alike in all the above situations, (ie) irrespective of the preceding vowel?
