Like I said, this is only a theory, and there are no surviving indo European languages you can point to to substantiate it with proof, as far as I know, including in Attic Greek, where the linguists only speculate how the smooth/rough breathing sounded like.  

  

My personal preference is to trust the tradition rather than unsubstantiated theories, with respect.
