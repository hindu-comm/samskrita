While there are many indo European languages which are descended from the ‘older’ ones like Samskrtam, Greek, Latin etc, none of the currently extant ones predate samskrtam.

No one applies principles of pronunciation from samskrtam to those languages, and treat them all differently, except for newly created linguists who are eager to apply every rule from every other language to samskrtam , and clear up non existent confusion by disregarding millennia of traditional teaching.

  

I have done some research in this matter and even the existence of a proto indo European language that ‘predated’ samskrtam is on shaky ground, in my opinion.

If there are so many indo European languages where this kind of breathing sound happens, please do let us know some of them and where exactly you see it, and why should however it is pronounced there be followed in samskrtam, when the vice verse rules of how to pronounce those languages is not taken from samskrtam.

  

With respects and regards
