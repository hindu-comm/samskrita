At the Macro level, ALL sandhi is optional. If you choose to do sandhi, before च , you have the option to convert the visarga to च। that is what you will find in most Puranas, Stotras and old texts for bhagavathula gita , and even Most of the new texts.

  

The distinction you are making does not exist as far as how the language has been taught for 1000’s of years. You either say Aha, ihi etc or do sandhi. There is no third option, and neither is there precedent for this third option. You can create your own rules when learning the language, of course. But if you see how the language has been spoken/recited etc, from Vedas to Stotras , these are the two options.

  

There is no ‘pure breathing’ ह used as the normal sound of a visarga, when there is no sandhi done. It is always an echo like sound. Not a voiceless silent breathing when the visarga stands at the end of an independent word, with no word after.

  

If you postulate such an hypothesis, you need to back it up with proofs from practice, because the language of samskrtam was and is a very much spoken language. You can hear it every day in temples and homes. Even if not being used that much for casual conversation, this language has been carefully kept alive with a very well structured pedagogical format for millennia. Throwing that history aside has no justification- especially because we are not talking about math or science, but a language, which is gained by hearing from one’s culture and tradition, not logical deduction.

  

Best wishes and regards.
