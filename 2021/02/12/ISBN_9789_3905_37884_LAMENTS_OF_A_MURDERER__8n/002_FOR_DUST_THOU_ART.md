The last sign in नम: indicates that a breath follows the final vowel, in this case the short "a" - when it is pronounced/chanted etc you need to hear the breath after the short "a" , which is confusing for modern - day people. That is why another vowel is often sounded after it, but ought not to be.

It is a typical ancient Indo-European language phenomenon. Just make sure that you let out breath after the last vowel, and you've got it!
