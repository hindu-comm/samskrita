In Narayaneeyam sloka - 1 of dasaka 26 regarding Gajendramokasha, the king Indradyumna is called pandya-khandaa-dhirajah.

1\) Does khanda means a territory which is part of a kingdom? What is the different between desa, khanda & rajya?

2\) who is adhiraja ? Is he superior to raja ? What is the diff between
raja, adhiraja, and samrat ?

Thanks.![nara-26-1 - Copy.png](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/9d8d1a962531/nara-26-1%20-%20Copy.png?part=0.1&view=1)
