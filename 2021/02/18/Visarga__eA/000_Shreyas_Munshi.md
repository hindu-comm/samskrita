I think I'll end the duscussion here. To my beginning learner's mind, it seems something is not right in your explanation. Visarga before च is converted not to च but to श् (not even full श).

  

For 1000s of years they believed the Sun goes round the earth till Galelio said it to be the otherwise (and he was hanged for that!). दु:ख is pronounced not as /duhukha/ but as /duhkha/.

I need more time to think over your scholarly explanation which is admittedly beyond me at this stage.

Thanks and regards.
