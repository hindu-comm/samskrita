सर्वेभ्यो नमो नमः,

  

We are creating a [free online library of Sanskrit books](https://en.amarahasa.com/) for learners of all levels and tastes. All of our books have word-for-word translations to establish meaning, and our simpler books also have cheerful illustrations and sentence-by-sentence translations so that beginners can feel confident in what they are learning.

  

Our library is based on the principles of modern second language acquisition research, which strongly recommend the following:

1.  focusing on input (reading and listening) over output (writing and
    speaking), drilling, memorization, or any form of conscious study;  
      
2.  using grammar only as a tool for clarifying unclear input, rather
    than as a major focus of study or as a syllabus around which our
    stories are organized;  
      
3.  using a smaller ("sheltered") vocabulary with full ("unsheltered")
    use of grammar overall, including different verb forms and sandhi;
    and  
      
4.  letting learners choose what kinds of content they read and engage
    with.  

With our library, we want to provide learners of all levels with *copious, compelling and comprehensible input*, since this is the true basis of acquiring a language and developing fluency. In time, we hope to make Sanskrit one of the easiest languages in the world to learn.

We look forward to your comments and questions.
