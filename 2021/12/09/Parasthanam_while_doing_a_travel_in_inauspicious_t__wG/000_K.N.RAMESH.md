उषश्शशंस गार्ग्यस्तु शकुनं तु ब्रुहस्पतिः ।

मनोजवं तु माण्डव्यः विप्रवाक्यं जनार्दनः ॥**महासुभाषितसंग्रहः , 7267**

  

**निर्गमः**- is another पद्धति -- one has to start tomorrow , but it is not auspicious - today itself the person would put some clothes in a house of known people ( en route ) in the same village / street . This is called निर्गम ।
