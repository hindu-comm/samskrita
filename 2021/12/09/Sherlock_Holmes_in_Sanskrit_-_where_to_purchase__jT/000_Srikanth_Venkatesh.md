The Sherlock Holmes Sanskrit translation is 160 Rupees in ExoticArt (<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/sherlock-holmes-translated-into-sanskrit-nze697/>)

  

That's 125 rupees shipping on a 35 rupees MRP... I wanted to know if there are any other book stores that charge a reasonable shipping cost.
