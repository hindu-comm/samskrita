श्रीमत्परमहंसपरिव्राजकाचार्यस्य

  

श्रीगोविन्दभगवत्पूज्यपादशिष्यस्य

  

श्रीमच्छंकरभगवतः कृतौ

  

प्रातःस्मरणस्तोत्रं

  

  

1

  

प्रातः स्मरामि हृदि संस्फुरदात्मतत्त्वं

  

सच्चित्सुखं परमहंसगतिं तुरीयम्

  

यत्स्वप्नजागरसुषुप्तिमवैति नित्यं

  

तद्ब्रह्म निष्कलमहं न च भूतसङ्घः

  

Early in the morning, I contemplate on the reality of Atman, the Existence-Awareness-Bliss Absolute, pulsating clearly in the heart (as I, I). It is the goal of the great, realized souls ; it is the fourth,
ever witnessing and illuminating the three states of waking, dream,
and sleep. I am that Brahman without parts; I am not at all the conglomerate of the five elements.

प्रातर्भजामि मनसा वचसामगम्यं

  

वाचो विभान्ति निखिला यदनुग्रहेण ।

  

यन्नेतिनेतिवचनैर्निगमा अवोचन्

  

स्तं देवदेवमजमच्युतमाहुरग्र्यम् ।

  

Early in the morning, I worship the Atman, which cannot be described by words and conceptualized by the mind. Yet all words shine ( convey their meaning ) by the grace ( in the form of awareness ) of Atman. The Vedas point out or signal Atman repeatedly using the words that negate all superimpositions. That Atman is the Gods of gods, the one that illumines all the organs. It is birthless. The realized people say that It is the origin of creation and It never slips down to the level of the unreal appearance of creation.

प्रातर्नमामि तमसः परमर्कवर्णं

  

पूर्णं सनातनपदं पुरुषोत्तमाख्यम् ।

  

यस्मिन्निदं जगदशेषमशेषमूर्तौ

  

रज्ज्वां भुजङ्गम इव प्रतिभासितं वै ।

  

Early in the morning, I prostrate unto the timeless abode well known in the scriptures as the Supreme Purusha. That infinite Supreme Reality shines like the sun and transcends the darkness of ignorance. It alone is manifest as all. This entire universe appears on the substratum of that Reality like the serpent on the rope.

श्लोकत्रयमिदं पुण्यं लोकत्रयविभूषणम् ।

  

प्रातःकाले पठेद्यस्तु स गच्छेत्परमं पदम् ॥४॥

  

Whosoever recites these three sacred verses, which are an ornament of the three worlds, early in the morning, gains the supreme goal, the Purusha.
