नमः।

  

Why no Natvam in कुर्वन्ति / क्रियन्ते etc though नकारः follows रेफः whereby as per Natvavidhanam it should have been कुर्वण्ति / क्रियण्ते।

  

Answer -

  

This is a classic example of the brilliance of Panini muni.

  

पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्। ८।२।१ calls for any शास्त्रम् post this Sutra is असिद्धम् to operations prior to this Sutra.

  

In Sutras after the above Sutra also, the post शास्तम् is असिद्धम् to previous सूत्राणि/शास्त्राणि।

  

In the sequence of operations of रूपसिद्धिः of say कुर्वन्ति, by a Sutra the नकारः is changed to अनुस्वारः। The Sutras of णत्वम् comes next. After the Natvasutras, by ParasavarNa Sutra anusvara is changed back to nakaraH.

  

By this brillianct sequencing of Sutras and caveating post is not recognised by prior by Sri.Panini,

  

**at the time of the need to decide about nakaraH, there is NO nakaraH at all available there to consider changing it to णकारः। As णत्वम् sees only कुर्वंति and cannot recognise the post परसवर्णकार्यम् by which anuswara within a word is compulsorily changed to ParasavarNa, in this case तवर्गस्य परसवर्णः नकारः।**

  

By this deft process there is no णत्वम् for कुर्वन्ति though eligible otherwise.

  

जयतु संस्कृतम्।
