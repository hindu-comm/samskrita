Panini's Asthadhyayii is a world-renowned foundational treatise of Samskrita Grammar. It is a masterful work of linguistics which stands as a jewel in the history of human civilization. Here is an opportunity to study Panini's grammar directly in Samskritam.  
  
Smt Pushpa Dixit ji's method is unique: Based in Panini's own approach, and so logical. As a result, it is easy for everyone to follow along and master the subject. When it comes to Paniniiya Vyakaranam, advanced and beginner students of Samskrtam are all on equal footing-- so everyone is welcome! All you need is basic knowledge of spoken Samskritam, and a desire to learn.  
  
We will begin at the very beginning of Paniniiya Vyakaranam, and move ahead in a sequence and fashion which is easy for all.  
  
Every year many people try to learn Shastriiya Vyakaranam through study of Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudhi (LSK), and end up leaving the study because of how difficult it seems. But we are here to say that it only seems difficult because LSK is not organized in a logical way. It does not follow Panini's own approach. Join us, and found out how easy Paniniiya Vyakaranam can be!
