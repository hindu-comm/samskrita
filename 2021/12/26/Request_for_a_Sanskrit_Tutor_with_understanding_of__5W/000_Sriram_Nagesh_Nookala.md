All,  
  
I am interested in reading some of the Shankara Bhashya and Anandagiri Tika. Starting with Bhagawad Gita, I want to do additional texts tooin future. As part of that, I want to study these texts with help of a Sanskrit scholar on a one-on-one basis. Would like the Scholar to understand Advaita philosophy too .



This will be at some mutually arranged timings. I want to read those texts with them in class and they can help me understand the Sanskrit word meanings and any special grammatical constructions. I donot need them to explain the technical explanation of Vedantic concepts (I will work on that myself). But if they have good knowledge of Vedanta Darshana and otherDarshanas, that's helpful as well.



Can anyone recommend how to find someone like that?



Thanks

Nagesh
