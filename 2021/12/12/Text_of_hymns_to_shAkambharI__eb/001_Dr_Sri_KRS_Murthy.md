Dear Dr. Harry VasishTha Spier

  

This is just an interesting information about Shaakaambari.

  

In a temple called Shankara Matha in Bangalore, the goddess Sharada was decorated very artistically fir nine nights of the festival days of Navaratri.

  

One of the nights was Shaakaambari decoration, the decoration is alankaara in samskritam. Shaakaambari is a goddess with the dress of different vegetables.

  

We growing up in Bangalore used to stand in a queue to get a brief glimpse of the alankaara

  

Other alankaara included butter, kumkuma and arishina (turmeric), flowers etc.
