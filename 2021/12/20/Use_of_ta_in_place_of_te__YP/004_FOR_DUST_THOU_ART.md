Greetings!  

  

First of all, the vowel "e" is considered to have a "y" element contained in it. Secondly, the vowel "e" is the "guna" of both long and short "i" , which means that, on the vowel level alone, "e" is considered to be a combination of short "a" + either long or short "i" (that is to say, the "y" element). The third sandhi rule involved in this passage is that when "e" comes into contact with any vowel other than short "a", the "y" element drops out: in this case, the word "te" is coming into contact with the short initial "i" (that is to say, a vowel other than short "a") of the word "ime", so the y-element is dropping out and leaving the short "a", resulting in "ta" instead of "te".  

  

Hope this helps...

  

Thanks!
