Can you give a link to the text you are looking at.

I've looked at two on-line Kashi Vishwanath Suprabhatam ,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprabhatam#Text_and_meaning> and

<https://shaivam.org/scripture/English-Script/128/shri-vishvanatha-suprabhatam> .

They differ from each other but neither has the word you are asking about.
