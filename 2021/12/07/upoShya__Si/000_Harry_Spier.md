Dear list members:

Monier-Williams dictionary has the entryउपोष्य with the meaning "having fasted" formed fromउप + वस् +य .

But the dictionary also has the entry:उपोष् with meaning "burning down" formed fromउप + उष् .

  

Does that mean the indeclinable participle ofउपोष् "burning down"is alsoउपोष्य i.e.उप + उष् +य

Thanks,

Harry Spier
