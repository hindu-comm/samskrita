Thanks. I also reached out to the authors of the SARIT project and was pointed to these two links:

  

\- [PanditProject.org](http://PanditProject.org) (database of Sanskrit manuscripts, sometimes with [archive.org](http://archive.org) links. I'm not sure how comprehensive it is.)  

[- NCC](https://vmlt.in/ncc/39?page=1) (*New Catalogus Catalogorum*, from the University of Madras. An exhaustive list, but with few links to actual texts.)
