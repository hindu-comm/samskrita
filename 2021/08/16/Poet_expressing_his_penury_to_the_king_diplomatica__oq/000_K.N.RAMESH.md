Here is a nice example of a poet praising the king and conveying his living in penury in a very dignified way. And the poet does it in just 32 syllables. Now the shloka:-

  

राजन् त्वत् कीर्तिचन्द्रेण तिथयः पूर्णिमा: कृता: \|

  

मद्-गेहान्न बहिर्याति तिथिः एकादशी भयात् \|\|

  

Oh king, the moon of your fame is shining all the time like on full moon night. Because of this, all the Thithis with waning and waxing moon are becoming irrelevant. The Ekadasi Thithi (is hiding in my home and) is not going out of my home for fear of getting eliminated. In this way, he indirectly conveys that his family is starving everyday and seeks the king’s munificence.
