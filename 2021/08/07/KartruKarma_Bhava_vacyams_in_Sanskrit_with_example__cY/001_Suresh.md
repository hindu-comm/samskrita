Nice work.

  

Couple things that I noticed.

  

A. In the first example of कर्तरि to कर्मणि,

  

१. महिलाः जलम् आनयन्ति \|           १. महिलाभिः लेखः लिख्यते  

  

the क्रिया धातु and the कर्म are different.

  

B. Did you also intend to provide examples for कर्मवाच्यं कर्तृवाच्ये
परिवर्तनम् ?

  

Thanks.

  

Suresh
