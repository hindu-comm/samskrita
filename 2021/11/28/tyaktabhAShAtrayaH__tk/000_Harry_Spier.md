Dear list members,

In theHaracaritacintāmaṇi chapter 27 there is this sentence.

त्यक्तभाषात्रयः सो ऽपि गुणाढ्यो द्विजसत्तमः

Guṇāḍhya is the best of Brahmans, he has forsaken the use of the three languages.

Can someone shed any light on which three languages are meant, and why foresaking the use of them is considered a praiseworthy thing.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
