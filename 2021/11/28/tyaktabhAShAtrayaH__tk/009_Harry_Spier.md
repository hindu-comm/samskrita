As far as I can see from this link:<https://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/Mahabhashya_I.pdf>

It appears that this line isn't in either the Mahabhasya or its commentaries. What seems to have happened is that in this edition of the Mahabhasya and the commentaries of Kaiyata and NagesaBhatta, the chapter 27 of theHaracaritacintamani was put in at the start of the book (before the Mahabhasya or commentaries) because it gives the legend of the origin of Paniniya grammar. See the first page after the title page, where the text and chapter are clearly identified.
