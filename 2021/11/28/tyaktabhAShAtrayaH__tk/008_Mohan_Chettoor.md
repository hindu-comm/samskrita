Thank you very much, sir. It's not OCR, but a crude and most unconventional method developed indigenouslyby me, out of dire necessity. Firstly, OCR will not work for Sanskrit( as far as I know) and secondly software for conversion of PDF comes with a price. So I have been desperately trying for some means to extract at least the matter contained in such non-editable PDF documents. The methodology or the*modus operandi*is simple:

Open the PDF;

click 'edit';

click ; 'take a snapshot';

select the entire PDF page or part thereof;

right click on the selected portion;  

click 'copy selected graphic' and keep it;

open Gmail and click 'compose';

paste the matter in the text box and send it to our own mail id;

save the matter in Google 'Drive' as photo image;

open the image in the Drive' with Google Docs;

Two portions will appear: top one mere non-editable photo image and the lower one editable copy in alphabets;

select the lower portion and save separately in 'word' or 'Google 'Drive';

edit the document, modify the font as necessary and use it forwhatever purpose.

Note:

*1. The process may seem to be time-consuming and laborious and unless you have patience, there is every likelihoodof the same being dropped half-the-way.*

*2. The letters are sensed, recognised and picked up by the artificial intelligence and the success of the process entirely depends upon the clarity and quality of the matter to be copied. There is every chance of some portion of/or the entire matter not being able to be copied.*

*3. Most importantly, there is every possibility of some letters or alphabets being wrongly copied or omitted. You have to physically compare the matter with the original lest we get a faulty product.*

*4. This will not work in the case of PDF documents which are locked or password-protected.*

*  
*

Notwithstanding the above shortcomings, the end-result is promising. Just compare this with the ecstasya mother feels when the baby comes out, albeit crying, after all the agonies of pregnancy and delivery.

I enjoy every bit of the process. Wishing you the same,

Mohan Chettoor.
