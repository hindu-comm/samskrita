Thank you Shankara and Nagaraj,

  

I didn't put any more lines in, because it says nothing more about this at that place in the chapter. But I've now found further on in the chapter, it paraphrases more or less what was passed on by Shankara from the Kathasaritsagara. As pointed out by Shankara, the three languages areसंस्कृतम्, प्राकृतम्, देशभाषाम् (Sanskrit, Prakrit and the vernacular). In this version of the story Gunadhya goes on to learn and speakपिशाचभाषाम् the language of the Pisaca demons, which isn't prohibited by his vow.

Thanks,  

Harry Spier
