Yes, your guess is correct. What 'looks something like malayalam' is Malayalam only. Actually my project includes deciphering the original devanagari script in the non-editable PDF document into editable word document, transliteration into Malayalam script and then transliteration into Malayalam. While copying of this matter, a transliterated Malayalam sloka inadvertently appeared, which I forgot to delete. Thanks for pointing out this.

  

Meanwhile, there is a beautiful tool available for transliteration from and into indian languages

-   Bengali -   Devanagari -   Gujarati -   Gurmukhi -   Kannada -   Malayalam -   Oriya -   Tamil -   Telugu. -
