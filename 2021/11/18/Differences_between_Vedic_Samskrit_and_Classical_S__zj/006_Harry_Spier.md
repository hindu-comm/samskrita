Dear Satyajita,

Concerning your purpose of comparing the vedic and classical language, MacDonell says in the preface to his " A Vedic Grammar for Students":

  
"When planning the book I resolved, after much reflection, to make it correspond paragraph by paragraph to my Sanskrit Grammar for Students, this being the best way to enable students to compare and contrast every phenomenon of the earlier and the later language".

  

Regards,

Harry Spier
