Dear Satyajit,

  

A A MacDonell wrote two grammars "A Sanskrit Grammar for Students" and a "Vedic Grammar for Students". Wwherever possible the numbering of the different sections are the same in the two books to make it easier to see the differences between classical sanskrit grammar and vedic grammar. Also in his "A Sanskrit Grammar for Students" he has an appendix listing the main differences between classical and vedic grammar.

  

These can be downloaded from [archive.org](http://archive.org). The links are:

<https://archive.org/download/in.ernet.dli.2015.105655/2015.105655.Vedic-Grammar-For-Students.pdf>  

  

Hope this helps,

Harry Spier
