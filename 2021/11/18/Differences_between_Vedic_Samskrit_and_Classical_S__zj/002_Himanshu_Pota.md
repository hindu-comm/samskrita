Satyajitji,

  

The great grammarian Prof Pushpa Dikshit is emphatic that one should avoid the distinction between classical and Vedic Sanskrit. Sanskrit is Sanskrit and Panini grammar covers both by keeping the door open with बहुलं छन्दसि। I am sure there are many learned scholars in this group who will throw further light on this but my 2c worth is not to treat them as separate but one whole Sanskrit language.

  

Thanks.
