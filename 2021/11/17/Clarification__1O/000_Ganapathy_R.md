Namaste

  

I need one clarification. In Visarga Sandhi whenअ+ : + (अ/soft consonants)=उकार: Andउकार takes गुण and becomes ओ. However, if the visarga is preceded by an avyaya then this rule is not applicable. Instead in this case the visarga takes रेफादेश. And the oft quoted examples are पुनरत्र, प्रातर्गच्छति.

  

However, I believe the word तत: is an avyaya but this rule does not seem to apply to this word. I find तत:‍‍‍+ युद्धाधाय = ततो युद्धाधाय (BG 2.38). Similarly आदित्यहृदयम् starts with ततो युद्ध परिश्रान्तम्.

  

Therefore, can anyone clarify if there are any exceptions to theरेफादेश rule applying to avyayas.

  

Om and pranam

  

Many thanks and kindregards

Ganapathy
