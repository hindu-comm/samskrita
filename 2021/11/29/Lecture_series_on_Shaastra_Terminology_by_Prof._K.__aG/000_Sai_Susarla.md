NamassarvebhyaH,

**Prof. K.E. Devanathan** varya is a highly accomplished Shaastra Vidwan and **Hon. Vice-chancellor of Karnataka Sanskrit University** (and the former VC of Sri Venkateshwara Vedic University, Tirupati).  

  

He has kindly consented to give a **FREE weekly lecture series (10 lectures)** on  

**शास्त्रीय-पारिभाषिक-पद-परिचयः**  

  

**How to understand shaastric discourse (Nyaaya & Miimaamsa) and the technical terminology used therein**.  

  

This is an excellent opportunity for those who want to go beyond Conversational Sanskrit and enter the Wonderful world of Bharatiya shaastriiya chintanam.
