Thank you sir for this link! I've just tried it on some text from a devanagari text from Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratishthan. It converted it to text perfectly and was smart enough to join words where there was a dash at the end of a line.

  

I couldn't see any credits on the webpage. Does anyone know who is responsible for this website and the tools on it?
