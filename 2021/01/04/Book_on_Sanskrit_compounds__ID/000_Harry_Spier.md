One of the list members asked for a recommendation on a book on sanskrit compounds. I find this book quite useful. "Hints to the Study of Sanskrit Compounds" published at the end of the 19th century. As it says in the preface "The precise aim of this little book is to give the student, that has already acquired an elementary knowledge of Sanskrit Grammar, more detailed information on Sanskrit compounds . . . "
