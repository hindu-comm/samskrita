The difference occurs when you try to read scriptures as prose vs poetry. In the former, the whole sentence will be read. For any visargas in between, they will follow the sandhi rules. In the latter case, when you chant as poetry, you may chant in chandas or metrical form. In which case, you split the shloka into 4 verses, with each verse consisting of 8 or 11 syllables. In such a case, the visarga appears - तस्य लोपः न भवति.

  

Hope this helps.
