PraNams,

If you can spare just 5 – 10 mins each day you can memorize all the 700 Shlokas of Srimad Bhagawad Gita.

• How do I do it? Starting from 14/01/2021 a shloka a day will be sent as audio file. For ease of practice, each paada (half line) of a Shloka will be recited twice.

• When will the Programme end? By Dec 2022.

• Will the meaning of the Shloka be given? No. This class is only for PArAyaNam. Those interested in understanding the Shlokas can get a book that has verse by verse meaning. Gita Press Gorakhpur, R.K. Mutt publications etc. are easily available in Giri trading and other leading stores. 

• What if I am not interested in memorizing? You can just do pArAyaNam.

This programme is an initiative of Samskrita Bharati, TamilNadu. The objective is to take Gitaamritam to each and every one.

Jayatu Samskritam, Jayatu Bharatam
