10 years ago I first wanted to know where this piece of the verse came from

and you can read here:

<https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/1/14>

Jayas tu pāṇḍu-putrāṇāṁ yeṣāṁ pakṣe janārdanaḥ

The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because Kṛṣṇa was on the side of the Pāṇḍavas. Jayas tu pāṇḍu-putrāṇāṁ yeṣāṁ pakṣe janārdanaḥ. Victory is always with persons like the sons of Pāṇḍu because Lord Kṛṣṇa is associated with them.

thank you very much

( i can speak english a little bit. Little. just a few words. )
