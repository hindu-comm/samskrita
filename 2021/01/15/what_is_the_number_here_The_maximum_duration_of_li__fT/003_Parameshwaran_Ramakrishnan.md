Yes, the life expectancyin Kali yuga may be around/upto 50 years. We have seen that statistically by population studies. See the graph below which clearly shows that around the 18th CE it was around 45-50 yrs. I could not find a quick reference prior to that.

However, from 19th CE onwards the life expectancyhas been steadily increasing - also shown in the statistical graph. Can we say that the Kali has ended?
