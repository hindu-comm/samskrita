Yes, I agree. This period between 2020-22 may mark a dip in the life expectancy graphs because of Covid. but, it will not depress the grach from its current expectancy of 75 (or so) to 55. That will be an impossible event.

Even during the recording of1500s when the average life spanwas indeed 50s - there were dips:<https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?tab=chart&time=1543..2019&region=World>

Someone in this group may point us to other scriptural references on the Yuga Cycle better and their interpretations. I am also aware of a scriptural reference which says the "Yuga" (its ending or beginning) is accurately determined by the arrival of Yuga purusha - sorry I do not have a ref for this too.
