As far as I know, Kali Yuga has not even properly begun!

Are we not still in the "Sandhi Period"?

Also, the context of the verse seems to indicate that the measure of life will decline steadily during Kali Yuga - and there are still well over 400000 years to go!

Contextually, I have understood this to mean that by the end of Kali Yuga, this will be the average lifespan.

  

Have a look at graphs on the COVID - they take "8 day averages", but within that there are ups and downs.

200 years is a fraction of the duration of Kali Yuga, so I would not read too much into this.

  

Perhaps if we retain our ignorance for another few hundred thousand years, we can pick this up at the end of the Yuga

:-)
