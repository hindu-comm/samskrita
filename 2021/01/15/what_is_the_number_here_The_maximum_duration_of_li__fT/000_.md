ŚB 12.2

त्रिंशद्विंशतिवर्षाणि परमायु: कलौ नृणाम्

they  

<https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/12/2/11/>  

translated it like this :  

**The maximum duration of life for human beings in Kali-yuga will become fifty years.**

Is it correct?

  

And is there additional extensive evidence in the Vedas about signs of deterioration in life, besides this book?

  

thank you very much

( i can speak english a little bit. Little. just a few words.)
