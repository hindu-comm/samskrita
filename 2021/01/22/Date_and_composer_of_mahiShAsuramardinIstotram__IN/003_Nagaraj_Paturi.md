someone says it is attributed to both Ramakrishna Kavi and Adi Shankaracharya. I'm here talking about what I've found:

Mahishasura mardini Stotram is a part of Bhagavatipadyapushpanjali stotram (भगवतीपद्यपुष्पांजलिस्तोत्र) which is written by Ramakrishna Kavi . You can read the full Bhagavati Padya Pushpanjali Stotram here in[Sanskrit](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/mahisha.html?lang=sa "sanskritdocuments.org")or[transliteration](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/mahisha.itx "sanskritdocuments.org").

It can be seen that After 6th verse of Bhagavati Padya Pushpanjali Stotram, Mahishasura Mardini Stotram starts which have 27 verses and then remains another three verses of Bhagavati Padya Pushpanjali Stotra. Verse 29 mention the author of Stotra who is Ramakrishna Kavi

> रमयति किल कर्षस्तेषु चित्तं नराणामवरजवरयस्माद्रामकृष्णः कवीनाम्।  
> अकृत सुकृतिगम्यं रम्यपद्यैकहर्म्यं स्तवनमवनहेतुं प्रीतये विश्वमातुः ॥ > २९॥ >

[Sanskrit documents page on Mahishasura Mardini Stotra](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/mahisha_mean.html?lang=sa "sanskritdocuments.org")also mentions that at the end:

> The stotra is part of bhagavatIpadyapuShpA.njalIstotra written by Shri > Ramakrishna Kavi.
