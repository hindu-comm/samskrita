Sri Goda Venkateswara Sastrigal was a Sri Vidya Upasaka and has written many books on Advaita and other topics. He has given a series of discourses on Mahishasuramardini stotram. He says emphatically that this poem was composed by Adi Shankara as he was traversing Vindhya Hills as part of his foot journey throughout Bharatam. You can listen to them on Youtube. Here is a write up about him on Mylapore Times after he passed away.
