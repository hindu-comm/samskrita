Dear list members,

I'm looking for information about the date and composer of the Mahiṣāsuramardinīstotram. The only information I've been able to find is a webposting that stated:

Mahiṣāsuramardinīstotram

Composer - Śri Rāmakrṣna Kavi  
Popularised by ŚrīAnantarāma Dikshitar Sengalipuram Anantarama(2 August 1903-30 October1969)  
(प्रातः-स्मरणीयः/ प्रातः-स्मरणयोग्यः).  
A great kathākār in the south. Used to do kathā on Rāmāyaṇam and Śrimad Bhāgavatam).

  

Can anyone give me any information about Śri Rāmakrṣna Kavi and
ŚrīAnantarāma Dikshitar .

  

Thanks,  

Harry Spier
