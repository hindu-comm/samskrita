All these Rishis are Vedic Rishis who are seers ( Mantradrista) Rishis who perceived the divine knowledge of Vedas under deep meditation. Mantras of Rig Yajur and Sama Veda are attributed to them. Since Vedas are not easy to decipher subsequently 6 angas (Shadangas) were conceived and written by Rishis to interpret the meaning of mantras in Vedas.

  

But to follow and practice all the karmas in Vedas there were certain Vidhi & Nishedhas (Dos and don'ts) were prescribed which is Shastras.

  

This in Bhagawat Geeta Sri Krishna says "Tasmsat Shastram Pramanam te karyaakarya vyavastitow" (he says hey Arjuna I not prescribing advices from my side to you. Shastras by these Vedic Rishis is the pramana (evidence) for all dos and don'ts so don't break you head and fight as shastras say kshatriyas are born to fight and not act as cowards. Lift you bow and arrow and fight with Kauravas.

  

So Shastras are divided into various sections. Namely

1\. Varnashrama : as per your varna want you should and shouldn't do

  

2\. Aanhika kanda : Morning getting up to sleeping in night what one should do. Rituals of the day.

  

3\. Shraddha kanda : How to satisfy ancestors by Shraddha and tarpana

  

4\. Samskara kanda : what are the Samskara which a person should undergo from birth to death.

  

5\. Thithi nirnaya : Deals with fixing good date for auspicious occassions

  

6\. Prayaschitta kanda : expiation of sins. Which sins incur which punishment.

  

Thus Shastras are elaborate manual of higher spiritual living.

  

The earliest and one of the 1st Shastra Grantha widely accepted translated and available is "Manu Smriti" which you can get in Google search.
