You say, Sir, "the name of that shastraisभगवद् गीता".  
We all respect Bhagvad Gita. It has its place. But it does not list out rituals for taking action, In chapter 16,Bhagwan says follow shastra.  
Geeta itself says 'act according to what is prescribed in the 'shastra'. So it has to be different from the geeta. My question is which is 'that' shastra.  
Submitted with regards. but still looking for an answer. Thanks.
