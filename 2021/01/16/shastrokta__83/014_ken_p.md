***In scientific language every word has to be very precise in meaning; it has to have only one meaning. In poetic language the word has to be liquid, flowing, dynamic, not static, allowing many meanings, many possibilities. The word has to be not precise at all; the more imprecise it is the better, because then it will be able to express all kinds of nuances.  
  
Hence the Sanskrit sutras can be defined in many ways, can be commented upon in many ways -- they allow much playfulness. For example, there are eight hundred roots in Sanskrit and out of those thousands of words have been derived, just as out of one root a tree grows and many branches and thousands of leaves and hundreds of flowers. Each single root becomes a vast tree with great foliage.*
