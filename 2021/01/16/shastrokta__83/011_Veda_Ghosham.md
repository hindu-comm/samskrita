Dear Shreyas Ji,

  

Namaste.

  

Shastras are as you know are Rishis Vakyas which have been written down by various Rishis as Smriti Granthas on do's and don'ts for a ideal life. Shastrras expounded by Rishi Bharadwaja is in Bharadwaja Smriti, Shastras expounded by Rishi Harita is in Harita Smriti, Atri in Atri Smriti etc. So Sri Krishna here refers to people to follow Shastras from whose lineage they identify themselves with. For example a Bharadawaja Gotra person will follow Bharadwaja Smriti which give you a full compilation of what his ancestor Rishi Bharadwaja has mentioned and so on for others.

  

Regards

  

Veda Ghosham
