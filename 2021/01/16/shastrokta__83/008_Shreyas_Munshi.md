Thank you Harry Sir. I am nobody yo doubt Shridhara's interpretation buy the tendency is yo say 'refer to veda sruti smruti etc because no one can question you; But refering to smruti shruti, purana is impracticable for a person who is ready to take action like performing a yagna, constructing a temple, repairing a wheel of the chariot, doing daanam etc. Is there no specific shastra?

I think not knowing the correct shastra has brought in a lot of corrupted practices in Hindu way of life.  

I am seeking guidence, Sir.
