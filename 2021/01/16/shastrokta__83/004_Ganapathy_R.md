The shastras here refer to Itihasa, Puranas, Smriti granthas and shruti both purva bhaga and upanishads. One needs to start with practicing the values enshrined in the itihasas. Then develop a reverential attitude (bhakti) towards the devatas (cosmic forces) and learn to live in harmonywith them. Then follow the विधिs and निषेदs based on the veda purva bhaga. Practice the karmas and upasanas prescribed for the attainment of the three purusharthas, artha, kama and dharma. And once one has attained enough chitta shuddhithrough all these, come to moksha shastra which is Upanishads and BhagavadGita for the attainment of moksha purushartha. And the relevant shastras have to be followed at the appropriate stage of life viz. brahmacharya, grihasta, vanaprastha and sanyasa. All these have to read into the Gita verse when it says follow the shastra.

  

This is my humble view.

  

Om and Thanks,

  

Ganapathy
