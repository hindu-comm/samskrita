Namaste.

  

Agamas give prescriptions for everyday religious action including atmartha puja, temple building and worship, vratas, dana etc. The Saiva, Sakta, Vaikhanasa, Pancaratra agamas are rich in details of carya, kriya, yoga and jnana action.

  

Along with the Veda, Vedanga, Itihasa, Purana, the Agamas are an important part of our canon that needs more attention.

  

Best regards

Deepa
