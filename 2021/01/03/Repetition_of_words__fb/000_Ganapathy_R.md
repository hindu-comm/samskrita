In नारायणीयम् the following usages appear-In dasakam 3 " नामनिवहानहं गायं गायं कुहचन विवत्स्यामि।" Also, in dasakam 25 ".रक्ताम्बु बद्धोत्सवं पायं पायमुदैरयो ...." In these lines we see the repeated usage like गायम् गायम् as well as पायं पायम् to mean "singing singing" and "drinking drinking ". Can anyone clarify the principle of grammar involved in these usages?  

  

Thanks
