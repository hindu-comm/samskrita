The below website has several Sanskrit-Telugu dictionaries integrated.  

<https://www.andhrabharati.com/dictionary/index.php>

  

While it has separate link for Sanskrit-English dictionaries, but for Sanskrit-Telugu dictionaries, one can search under Telugu dictionaries itself (because they are using Telugu script for Sanskrit words) and type the Sanskrit word in Telugu script and get the meanings. It supports the following dictionaries. It is excellent site and I have been using it for last couple of years.

Samskrita - Telugu Nighantuvu - Vavilla 1943 edition

Samskrita - Andhra Nighantuvu , Sri Mudiganti Gopalareddy et al 2019, it has excellent vyutpatti/nirvachana of each word (etymological derivation of various words)

Sarva Shabda Sambodhini - Samskrita Nighantuvu - Andhra Teeka Sahita - Sri Paravastu Srinivasacharya 1875

  

It also has Telugu-Sanskrit dictionary, Andhra-samskrita nighantuvu 1971, authored by Sri Pullela Sriramachandrudu et al.

  

Hope that helps,
