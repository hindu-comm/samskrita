Jagannatha ji, it must be an excellent dictionary but if it were available in machine readable (text/doc/html) format, that would be much more useful. For example searching, modifying, extracting text from it is very difficult if not impossible.  

  

The best gati for this type of documents is to put them on Sanskrit wikisource, where they will be automatically OCRed. Then proofread the pages one by one manually. This way it becomes 'machine readable' text.

  

Or, see if it is already available in text format somewhere.
