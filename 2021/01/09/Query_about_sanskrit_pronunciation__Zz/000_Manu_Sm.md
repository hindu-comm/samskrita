Namaste

I have been chanting many stotrams and japas since childhood that were taught to me by my parents , however since some time I wanted to assess my pronunciations of those and to learn how correct pronunciations , utterance and recitations are done , so i wanted to start with basics .

It would be greatly helpful to get any suggestions for resources to learn Sanskrit pronunciation.
