Namaste all,

  

I am not able to get much information about the word *Haindava*.

  

It seems to me to be Samskritic in origin, and is similar to the word "Saindhava" in point of grammatical construction, but I am not able to confirm this.

  

May I request members here to clarify the etymology, meaning and usage of this word pls.

  

with thanks  

Govind Kashyap
