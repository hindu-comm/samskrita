Dear scholars,

  

what is the desiderative form of the optative of root jīv ?  

In the following verse  
![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/896dcce6427fd/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

seems to beजिजीविषे,but I would have expected जिजीविषेत्  

Can anyone help me understand?  

  

Thanks

valerio
