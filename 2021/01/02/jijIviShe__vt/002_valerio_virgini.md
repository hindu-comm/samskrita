Jagannatha ji

thanks for the clear explanation  
surely it is as you say, in fact I saw that some commentators wrote:जीवितुम् इच्छामि.  

There are other cases of this type ofआर्षः प्रयोग ?  
  
What deceived me is that I consideredसोऽहं as av. उपमान-पूर्वपद-कर्मधारय-समासwhich I translated: "a person like me" and therefore with a verb in the 3rd person singular.But obviously I still have a lot to learn.  

  

Thanks again  

valerio
