While I am not aware of shloka-by-shloka English translation of Yoga vasistha, in Telugu it's painstakingly written by late Sri Swami Vidya Prakshananda giri of Sukhabrahmashramam, Srikalahasti in 8 volumes.

  

Soft copies of 8 volumes can be found here.<https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22Yogavasistha+Telugu+Translation%22>

  

Swamiji also delivered talks in Telugu on yoga vasistha

Hope that helps.

Subbu
