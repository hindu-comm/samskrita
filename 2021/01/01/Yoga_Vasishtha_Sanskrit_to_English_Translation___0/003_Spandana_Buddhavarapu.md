I would love to hear the audio of Sanskrit to Telugu as you mentioned. Please share it with me. I am currently listening to Yoga Vasishtam by Samaveda Sharma Garu and would like to hear this too.

  

I found that Swami Venkatesananda's book, though concise, is a bit abridged, and does not have all the Sanskrit verses.

  

Thank you,

Spandana
