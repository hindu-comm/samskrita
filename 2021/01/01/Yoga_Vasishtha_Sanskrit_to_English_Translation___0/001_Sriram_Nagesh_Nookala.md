I donotknow of a digital copy that gives line by line Sanskrit to English.  
Swami Venkatesananda has a complete translation (without Sanskrit).  
I have Audio of Sanskrit to Telugu, line by line talks on Yoga Vasistha, by Brahmasri Yellamraju Srinivasa Rao garu.. I can point more info on how to get that, if that works foryou.

  

Thanks

Nagesh
