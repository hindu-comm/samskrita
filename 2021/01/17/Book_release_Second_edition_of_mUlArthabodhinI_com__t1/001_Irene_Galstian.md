\> \*About the Bhaktamāla\*  
\> The \*Bhaktamāla\* (literally, “The garland of devotees”), called the  
\> \*Śrībhaktamāla\* by the devout, is a celebrated classic in medieval Indian  

\> literature. It was composed by Gosvāmī Nārāyaṇadāsa (also known as  
\> Nābhājī), a contemporary of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa, sometime around the year  

\> 1600 CE. The \*Bhaktamāla\* was composed in the \*Kāvyabhāṣā\* language (a  

\> hybrid of Braj and Awadhi) with the poet showing a greater use of Braj  

\> words. The work consists of 214 verses (17 \*dohā\*s, one \*kuṇḍaliyā\* and 196  
\> \*chappaya\* verses) which sing the glory of \*bhakta\*s (devotees) in an  
\> inclusive and liberal context—spanning across \*yuga\*s, geographies,  

\> languages, genders, castes, social strata, and religious sects. Nābhājī is  

\> considered to be the master of \*chappaya\* metre; he is to the \*chappaya\*  
\> what Kavi Bihārī is to the \*dohā \*and Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa is to the  
\> \*caupaī\*. With  
\> the \*Bhaktamāla\* of Nābhājī, a new genre started in the \*bhāṣā\* literature  
\> of India—the Bhaktamāla genre—many more \*bhaktamāla\*s were later composed  

\> by poets from different sects. Starting with the commentary  

\> \*Bhaktirasabodhinī\* (c. 1712) of Priyādāsa, the original \*Bhaktamāla\* has  

\> been commented upon and expounded by scholars throughout the eighteenth,  
\> nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There have been translations and/or  

\> adaptations of the \*Bhaktamāla\* in many languages including Sanskrit,  

\> Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, English, Persian, and Urdu. Interest in  

\> the \*Bhaktamāla  
\> \*continues to flourish in the twenty-first century both within India and  
\> abroad, examples being the special edition \*Bhaktamālāṅka\* of \*Kalyāṇa  
\> \*(published  

\> by Gita Press) in 2012, and James P Hare’s doctoral thesis on Bhaktamāla  
\> submitted to the Columbia University in 2011.  
\>  
\>  

\> \*About Nābhājī (author of the Bhaktamāla)\*As he himself testifies in the  
\> \*Bhaktamāla\*, Gosvāmī Nārāyaṇadāsa or Nābhājī was a fourth-generation  
\> disciple of Svāmī Rāmānandācārya with the \*paramparā\* being Rāmānandācārya,  

\> Anantānanda, Kṛṣṇadāsa Payāhārī, Agradāsa, and Nābhājī. As per traditional  
\> accounts, he was born without eyesight in a poor Brahmin family in  
\> Rajasthan, sometime in the later sixteenth century. He was left to fend for  
\> himself in a forest by his parents during a drought. Nābhājī was rescued by  
\> Agradāsa and Kīlhadāsa, who miraculously granted him vision and initiated  

\> him in the \*virakta \*order of Rāmānandā. Nābhājī stayed for most of his  
\> life in Galta (near Jaipur) in Rajasthan, and composed the \*Bhaktamāla \*as  

\> per the orders of his Guru Agradāsa (as Nābhājī himself says in the fourth  

\> verse of the \*Bhaktamāla\*).  
\>  
\>  
\> \*About Mūlārthabodhinī\*The \*Mūlārthabodhinī \*is a small commentary in  
\> around 55,000 words on the original verses of the \*Bhaktamāla\*. The  

\> commentary was spontaneously composed and dictated by Jagadguru  
\> Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya in December 2013 over just fifteen  
\> hours. The dictation was captured in audio recordings and subsequently  
\> typed, proofread, and typeset in ten days by volunteers of Śrī Tulasī Pīṭha  
\> Sevā Nyāsa for the first edition which was released on Makara Saṁkrānti VS  
\> 2070 (14 January 2014). The first edition was sold out in the next few  
\> years and there was a longstanding demand for a second edition. The second  
\> edition was planned at the beginning of VS 2077, but its publication was  
\> delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second edition is newly typeset  
\> in a Unicode font (Chanakya Sanskrit) and has been printed in Mumbai. Some  
\> typographical mistakes from the first edition have been fixed in the second  
\> edition. The second edition was released day before yesterday on Makara  
\> Saṁkrānti VS 2077, exactly seven years after the release of the first  
\> edition.

\> \*About the XeLaTeX Source Code\*  
\> The XeLaTeX source code for the second edition of the \*Mūlārthabodhinī \*is  

\> being released under the GNU General Public License. Everything used to  
\> typseset the book, except the font files, are included in the release. In  
\> addition to the main font, Chanakya Sanskrit (for Devanagari), the book  
\> uses three other fonts: Arial Unicode MS (for unicode symbols), Charis SIL  
\> (for IAST with diacritics), and Rupee Foradian (for rupee symbol). If the  
\> user does not have these fonts, they may simply use any other Unicode fonts  

\> and accordingly change the font name in the lines with the \*\\setmainfont  
\> \*and  
\> \*\\newfontfamily \*commands in the XeLaTeX source code. The code will shortly  

\> be put up on github also.
