**About the Bhaktamāla**  
The *Bhaktamāla* (literally, “The garland of devotees”), called the*Śrībhaktamāla*by the devout, is a celebrated classic in medieval Indian literature. It was composed by Gosvāmī Nārāyaṇadāsa (also known as Nābhājī), a contemporary of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa, sometime around the year 1600 CE. The *Bhaktamāla* was composed in the *Kāvyabhāṣā* language (a hybrid of Braj and Awadhi) with the poet showing a greater use of Braj words. The work consists of 214 verses (17 *dohā*s, one *kuṇḍaliyā* and 196 *chappaya* verses) which sing the glory of *bhakta*s (devotees) in an inclusive and liberal context—spanning across *yuga*s, geographies, languages, genders, castes, social strata, and religious sects. Nābhājī is considered to be the master of *chappaya* metre; he is to the *chappaya* what Kavi Bihārī is to the *dohā* and Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa is to the *caupaī*.With the *Bhaktamāla* of Nābhājī, a new genre started in the *bhāṣā* literature of India—the Bhaktamāla genre—many more *bhaktamāla*s were later composed by poets from different sects. Starting with the commentary *Bhaktirasabodhinī* (c. 1712) of Priyādāsa, the original*Bhaktamāla* has been commented upon and expounded by scholars throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There have been translations and/or adaptations of the *Bhaktamāla* in many languages including Sanskrit, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, English, Persian, and Urdu. Interest in the *Bhaktamāla* continues to flourish in the twenty-first century both within India and abroad, examples being the special edition *Bhaktamālāṅka*of *Kalyāṇa* (published by Gita Press) in 2012, and James P Hare’s doctoral thesis on Bhaktamāla submitted to the Columbia University in 2011.  
  
**About Nābhājī (author of theBhaktamāla)  
**As he himself testifies in the *Bhaktamāla*, Gosvāmī Nārāyaṇadāsa or Nābhājī was a fourth-generation disciple of Svāmī Rāmānandācārya with the *paramparā* being Rāmānandācārya, Anantānanda, Kṛṣṇadāsa Payāhārī, Agradāsa, and Nābhājī. As per traditional accounts, he was born without eyesight in a poor Brahmin family in Rajasthan, sometime in the later sixteenth century. He was left to fend for himself in a forest by his parents during a drought. Nābhājī was rescued by Agradāsa and Kīlhadāsa, who miraculously granted him vision and initiated him in the *virakta* order of Rāmānandā. Nābhājī stayed for most of his life in Galta (near Jaipur) in Rajasthan, and composed the *Bhaktamāla* as per the orders of his Guru Agradāsa (as Nābhājī himself says in the fourth verse of the *Bhaktamāla*).  
  
**About Mūlārthabodhinī  
**The *Mūlārthabodhinī* is a small commentary in around 55,000 words on the original verses of the *Bhaktamāla*. The commentary was spontaneously composed and dictated by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya in December 2013 over just fifteen hours. The dictation was captured in audio recordings and subsequently typed, proofread, and typeset in ten days by volunteers of Śrī Tulasī Pīṭha Sevā Nyāsa for the first edition which was released on Makara Saṁkrānti VS 2070 (14 January 2014). The first edition was sold out in the next few years and there was a longstanding demand for a second edition. The second edition was planned at the beginning of VS 2077, but its publication was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second edition is newly typeset in a Unicode font (Chanakya Sanskrit) and has been printed in Mumbai. Some typographical mistakes from the first edition have been fixed in the second edition. The second edition was released day before yesterday on Makara Saṁkrānti VS 2077, exactly seven years after the release of the first edition.

  

**About the XeLaTeX Source Code**

The XeLaTeX source code for the second edition of the*Mūlārthabodhinī* is being released under the GNU General Public License. Everything used to typseset the book, except the font files, are included in the release. In addition to the main font, Chanakya Sanskrit (for Devanagari), the book uses three other fonts:Arial Unicode MS (for unicode symbols), Charis SIL (for IAST with diacritics), and Rupee Foradian (for rupee symbol). If the user does not have these fonts, they may simply use any other Unicode fonts and accordingly change the font name in the lines with the *\\setmainfont* and *\\newfontfamily* commands in the XeLaTeX source code. The code will shortly be put up on github also.

  

Thanks and regards,
