Namaste

  

There have been a lot of requests from the participants of the Subhashitam Samskritam course to continue offering courses. While for the next few months, Samskrita Bharati will focus on the teacher training course and follow-ups (as well as look into the possibility of a new course from May or July onwards), IIT Roorkee Sanskrit club is collaborating with "Team Samsaadhanii" and offering a course, planned to start on the eve of Basant Panchami

  

Since this course needs prerequisite knowledge of Samskritam, it is being offered to those who scored 35 marks or above out of 80 marks for the MCQs of SuSa exams 2/3/4 (prorated) and final exam put together.
