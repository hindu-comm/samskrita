S.A.T.T.V.A. (Samskritam Academy for Teacher's Training and Value Addition) welcomes you to a 90 minutes of seamless performance that takes you to the serenity of mystic and symphonic silence.

  

Let us use this silence, to go back by 5000 years and peek into the heart and mind of the Yogis.

  

In the process, let's understand the birth of the meaningful Vedas, which is intriguing, yet exciting.

  

Such Vedas when chanted and perfectly blended with the Bhāratīya classical music, helps us understand our role in making this vast cosmos a harmonious place to live.
