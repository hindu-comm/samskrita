Hello,

  

Sanskrit issues of Chandamama are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). We would like to release them in a machine-readable format for public use, but the license of them is not obvious, and we don't want to invest time in digitizing work that is under copyright. For example, this article suggests the work has no owner but that it could be under new copyright in the future:

Is there someone here who can authoritatively state whether or not these issue are in the public domain, or who might be able to help us find an answer to this question? We have investigated the issue somewhat but cannot find reliable information on the current state of affairs.
