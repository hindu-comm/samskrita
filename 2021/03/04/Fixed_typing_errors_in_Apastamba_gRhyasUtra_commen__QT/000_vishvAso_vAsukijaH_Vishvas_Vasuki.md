**Goal**  

I wanted to get typed AnAkulA and tAtparyadarshanI commentaries to Apastamba gRhyasUtra to an error-free state. The pdf is available on [archive.org](https://archive.org/stream/APASTHAMBAGRUHYASUTRAMSUDARSHANAHARADATHA/APASTHAMBA%20GRUHYASUTRAM%20%28SUDARSHANA%2CHARADATHA%29#page/n31/mode/2up). Well, it was typed up by someone a long time ago (and I had published it in [wikisource a long time ago](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AC_%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%BF,_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE,_%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%83_%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D_%E0%A4%9A)), but that version has many errors and that makes it irritating to read.  

  

  

**Results**

  

Results of correction are available for free at <https://vvasuki.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/gRhyam/TIkA/> (besides the [plain text markdown](https://github.com/vvasuki/vedAH/blob/master/content/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/gRhyam/TIkA/17_07.md)); and anyone will be welcome to access, use, copy, publish it however they like.

  

**Efforts and pending work  
**

A typical piece of correction can be seen here - <https://github.com/vvasuki/vedAH/pull/41/files> , and all correction activities may be seen at this link - <https://github.com/vvasuki/vedAH/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Akishorsharma77> , for the most part ranging from #20 to #46. This though does not quite show the effort required in reading each word during proofreading; and further checks for errors which may have slipped past is pending. Pull requests are welcome.  

  

**Acknowledgement**

  

Correction was done by shrI kishore. Expenses of this work are partly borne by shrI harikiraN. üôè  

  

**Importance of the work**: I frequently refer to it for planning saMskAra-s in my household, and presumably it will similarly be the case for a good majority of south Indian brAhmaNas. Flowing text will be far better than pdfs or physical books.
