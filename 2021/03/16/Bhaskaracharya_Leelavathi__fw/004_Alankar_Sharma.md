Hi Shekhar ji,

  

Deducing and finding the "Hidden Meaning" out of the Lilavati example, I think is "AtiRanjanA". From a mathematical example we should not derive at such matter. For this we have "MahaBharata", Which is "Original" story of Arjun and Karn.

  

Please don't take it otherwise, just me mati.
