Dear Learned Members,

  

I shall be grateful if any learned member can give the Sloka , referred below, in Samskrtam, which is supposed to be in the above work of the great Rishi Bhaskaracharya

Quote :

  

  

\*BhƒÅskarƒÅchƒÅrya\* \*(1114 -1185 CE)\*, has been called the greatest mathematician of medieval India.

  

He was born in \*Bijapur\* in Karnataka, and is considered the progenitor of Differential Calculus - 500 years before Newton and Leibniz.

  

BhƒÅskarƒÅchƒÅrya wrote at least four mathematical treatises in Sanskrit.

One of them, titled Leelavati, contains many algebra-related teasers in this book, which have become the subject of significant research by scholars. These teasers are in the form of \*shlokas\* which pose problems.

  

The shlokas need to be interpreted correctly to decipher the meaning in order to find the solution.

  

There is one Sloka in it , The direct meaning of this shloka is a question formulated as follows:

  

During the battle between Arjuna and Karna in Mahabharata, Arjuna released some arrows. Out of all the released arrows:

  

‚Ä¢ Half were consumed in stopping the arrows coming from Karna,

  

‚Ä¢ 4 times the squareroot of the arrows were consumed to control the horses of Karna's chariot.

  

‚Ä¢ 6 were for gaining control over Shalya, the charioteer of Karna. (Shalya was the maternal uncle of Nakula and Sahadeva.)

  

‚Ä¢ 3 were used to take on the umbrella of the chariot, flag of the chariot and bow of Karna.

  

‚Ä¢ Finally Karna was killed with a single arrow.

ü§î

So how many arrows were released by Arjuna in the battle?

  

Basic algebra easily yields the answer to this question, if the equation is formulated correctly.

  

Let the total number of arrows be X.

  

The statements above can be reduced to the algebraic form

\*X = X/2 + 4‚àöX + 6 + 3 + 1\*

  

If we solve this we get the value of X=100 for the number of arrows shot by Arjuna.

  

However, the fun is not just getting the algebra right. There is so much of hidden information in this shloka.

  

If we pause to think a little deeper about the hidden meanings:

  

‚Ä¢ Even for an atirathi like Arjuna, it took as many as 50 arrows to stop the arrows of Karna - it tells us about the skills of Karna.

  

‚Ä¢ That the horses needed 40 arrows to immobilize the chariot tells us about the kind of training given to the horses in the battle field.

  

‚Ä¢ When even the horses needed 40 arrows, that Shalya the charioteer surrendered with just 6 tells us that he is favouring Arjuna.

  

‚Ä¢ 3 arrows to take the chariot and the bow shows the helplessness of Karna.

  

‚Ä¢ Once everything is in control, the enemy should vanquished in just a single arrow.

  

Best Regards
