Thanks for posting these texts. As you mention proofreading, could you also say what editions of the corresponding texts were used (and are corresponding scanned images available)?

(Is the Panchatantradifferentfrom<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/4_narr/vispancu.htm> for example)
