श्रीः।

  

I was requested offline for links to pages with full text (for use as teaching/ learning aids via production of \[de\]hyphenated text etc..). Hence, these were mechanically created (albeit with some extra sections towards the end):  
  
<https://vvasuki.github.io/kAvyam/TIkA/champUH/nItiH/panchatantram/full/>

<https://vvasuki.github.io/kAvyam/TIkA/champUH/nItiH/hitopadeshaH/full/>

  

To hide inline comments, just add ?comment_style=hidden in the end, as in :  
<https://vvasuki.github.io/kAvyam/TIkA/champUH/nItiH/panchatantram/full/?comment_style=hidden>
