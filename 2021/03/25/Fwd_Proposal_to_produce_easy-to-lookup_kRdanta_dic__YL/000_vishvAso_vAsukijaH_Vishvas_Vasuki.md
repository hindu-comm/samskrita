Subject: Proposal to produce easy-to-lookup kRdanta dictionary  
  

  
  

**Goal**: Produce data for digital dictionaries to easily lookup major kRdanta forms of all verb-roots using the kRdanta-rUpamAla data (already digitized, needs to fleshed out and filled up as described below). Essentially, we would need to get a learned vyAkaraNa vidvAn to fill up [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vbyf11ZI2BvPpr-QJt2g3fssjS99Z1ME3jJvUjRYzuM/edit#gid=0)
by looking at [the original text](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.312136/2015.312136.Krdantarupamala#page/n19/mode/2up).

  

**Importance**: Sanskrit is the Hindu liturgical language. Often times, a scholar or student needs to look up correct forms arising out of verbal roots to correctly understand (or compose) sanskrit text. Example: to understand विष्ण॑वे निखुर्य॒पाय॒ स्वाहा᳚ , one might wonder if निखुर्य can be taken to be नि + खुर् + ल्यप्.  

  

Standard dictionaries mostly don't provide this information (Just as simple English dictionaries wouldn't have cared to include "going" or "gone" in their word list). So, one needs mastery over vyAkaraNa to deduce such forms (which are a LOT due to the richness and flexibility of sanskrit) - and this is very hard to achieve for most people. Looking up correct forms is far easier.  

  

Knowing this, our predecessors have produced works such as kRdanta-rUpamAla - albeit they were designed for use as reference texts, before the advent of smart-phones and computers - so they had indirection like: "Same forms as in the case of this other root", and table structure (defined just once in the beginning of the book). Now, it is far easier to look words up on the phone - but one has to fix the aforementioned shortcomings.  

  

**Resources needed:  
**

Each verbal root gives rise to around 60 forms in the text. There are 2062 roots. Allotting 10 minutes attention per root, one arrives at 343 hours. I'll get it done by a learned gentleman I've been employing for much of the past year. He's very capable (I will supervise). I pay him by the hour (227.27 Rs). So, I estimate that it will cost me 77953.61 Rs. (If less effort than estimated is required, I'll let you know.) It will be great if you could contribute.

**Prior experience:**

We've published and distributed many dictionaries (including a primitive form of this kRdanta rUpa mAla) as part of the <https://github.com/indic-dict/> repositories.
