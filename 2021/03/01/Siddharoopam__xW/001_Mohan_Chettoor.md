Though not in the standard format of a siddharoopam, this scholarly work , ShabdaManjari I hope, would be helpful to know the various vibhakthiforms and verbal forms(in an abridged form). It does not contain Samaasachakram, BaalaPrabodhanam and Sri Ramodantham.Dhaatumanjari, its sister publication, contains detailed information regarding verbs and its manifold variations. Here is the link for sabdamanjari:
