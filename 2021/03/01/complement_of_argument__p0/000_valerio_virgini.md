Dear Members  
in Sanskrit, the complement of argument, can it be indicated with the genitive case?  

  

अवाच्यवादांश्च बहून् वदिष्यन्ति तवाहिताः ।

  

In this verse, can the word तव also mean "about you"?  

  

In other words, can these two translations both be grammatically correct?  

  

And the enemies will say many unbecoming words about you  

And your enemies will say many unbecoming words  

  

Thanks

valerio
