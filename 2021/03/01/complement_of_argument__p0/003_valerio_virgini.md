Most of the translations are: "Yourenemies", ( तव = possessive pronoun.)  

  

I quoted this verse because the pronoun तव is ambiguous. The core of my question is:  
Is it grammatically correct to translate तव as "abaut you"? Or is "abaut you" expressed only with the locative case?  

  

thanks

valerio
