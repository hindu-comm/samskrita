Alias of श्रीपरशुराम is भार्गव as son of भृगु, who is eulogised in श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता 10'25 as महर्षीणां भृगुरहम्. Many families in North India have भार्गव as their family name. One important feature of biography of श्रीपरशुराम is शापादपि शरादपि meaning "not to tolerate injustice and counter it by ब्रह्मतेजः or क्षात्रतेजः as the situation would warrant". This philosophy of श्रीपरशुराम seems very relevant at all times, because there will always be antisocial elements. All societies have to be safeguarded शापादपि शरादपि both by ब्रह्मतेजः and क्षात्रतेजः, which are detailed in श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता as ब्रह्मकर्म in (१८-४२) and क्षात्रं कर्म in (१८-४३). Personality Development should be comprehensive. That seems to be the essence of biography of श्रीपरशुराम, which seems to merit detailed study. Which should be the reference works for such study ?

महर्षी भृगु is also well-known for भृगुसंहिता, which is said to be a standard textbook on ज्योतिषम् (astronomy and astrology). A person well-versed in ज्योतिषम् is actually त्रिकालज्ञानी knowledgeable of all times - the Past, Present and Future. That may be the logic in the proclamation महर्षीणां भृगुरहम्. That suggests study of not only the biography of श्रीपरशुराम but study of भृगुवंश and भार्गवगोत्र. All inputs welcome !
