What is your perception of the script which I provided. Isn't it a downloading tool?

Your perception of 'built in' appears to be not in line with any accepted definition.

Your assumption of having permission to download just because it is not a script, is also similarly partial and at most an imagination.

  

If a website doesn't mention and try to block downloads and is putting items online for consumption, it's not against it.

And if it is, then it is against downloading through any means.

  

I wish you best of luck. I'll not like to engage any further and will definitely avoid to share anything similar on forums of such nature.
