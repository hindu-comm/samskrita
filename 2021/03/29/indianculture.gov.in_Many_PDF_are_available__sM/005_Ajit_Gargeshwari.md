Ok please use them I am not the site owner I am sorry my common sense suggestion which can be done by all to use any batch Downloader which works well with the site appears to have offended you. I am always for innovation am and favor of any tool to read and learn from rare books my context of my remark is this government took 15 to years to make available content for which the government has sponsored and finally after they did they just duplicated 90 percent of the material already on the web or under their own department websites. The site shows non familiarity with to books already scanned example Central Secretariat library booksor ASi books
