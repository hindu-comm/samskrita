Thanks for the link, sir. Regarding the errors, I had already explained the shortcomings in this process. I am well aware of such pitfalls and potholes. Your kind attention is drawn to the note attached to my explanatory para in this matter, which is reproduced below:

  

Note:

*1. The process may seem to be time-consuming and laborious and unless you have patience, there is every likelihoodof the same being dropped half-the-way.*

*2. The letters are sensed, recognised and picked up by the artificial intelligence and the success of the process entirely depends upon the clarity and quality of the matter to be copied. There is every chance of some portion of/or the entire matter not being able to be copied.*

*3. Most importantly, there is every possibility of some letters or alphabets being wrongly copied or omitted. You have to physically compare the matter with the original lest we get a faulty product.*

*4. This will not work in the case of PDF documents which are locked or password-protected.*

*
