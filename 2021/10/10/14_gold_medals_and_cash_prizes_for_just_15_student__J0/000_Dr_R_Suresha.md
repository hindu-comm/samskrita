Namaste.

Yes. It is unbelievable and unprecedentedbut true.

**The University of Mysore is the only university in India to offer 14 gold medals and cash prizes for just 15 students of MA in Sanskrit.**

Hence, join the Sanskrit MA program and stand a chanceof securing many gold medals.

When thecompetition is less andchances are high, never miss an opportunity.

The goldmedalist will have better benefitsin the future.

On top of that, you will be proud and delighted with your achievements.
