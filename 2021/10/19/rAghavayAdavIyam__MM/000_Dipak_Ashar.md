Dear Sirs, can you indicate where can i find this book written by वेन्कटाध्वरि with all the 60 shlokas with their meaning.

  

This book contains shlokas written with so much dedication and creativity that if we read normally, it is about shri Ram and if we read in the reverse way , it is about Shree Krishna.

  

Regards ,

  

Dipak Ashar
