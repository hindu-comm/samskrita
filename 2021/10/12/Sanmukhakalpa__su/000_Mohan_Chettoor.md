Given below is a reference to this work in a research paper on Dharma Chaurya Rasayanam.

  
  

‘In this case, however, the remnants of one text of presumably

authentic Steyasastra have actually been handed down. Incomplete,

incoherent, extremely corrupt, the S: Ṣaṇmukhakalpa, Practice of the Six-Faced God, would stand to mainstream sastra-s as a casual

compilation of pages from a badly ruined dictionary stands to an

Encyclopedia.’

  

INVITING THE ATTENTION OF THE LEARNED MEMBERS TO THIS BOOK Ṣaṇmukhakalpa-ON LORD KARTHIKEYA.
