I'm working on a series of lessons for complete beginners who want to understand Panini and the Ashtadhyayi.

  

As much as possible, I've written it for a general audience; anyone who's intellectually curious can read these lessons and appreciate the traditional system, even if they don't know any Sanskrit.

  

Please share this link with anyone who you think would be interested.
