It is from the Abhyankar's lessons he got the verse and wanted to get confirmation whether it is from the book लीलावती or not. He had not mentioned it even for courtesy where he got it or the information he got.

  

  

Anyhow thanks to Abhyankar for recognizing the riddle and magic squares in the verse. The other link was posterior to Abhyankar's posting.
