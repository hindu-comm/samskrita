My bad, I missed 6-4-51 णेरनिटि in the second Prakriya. There is no इट् here as suffix णिनि is यजादि and not वलादि, and with that in mind, I overlooked the इट्-अनिट् related rules.

  

So for क्रान्त अम् दर्शि इन् one would have 6-4-51 णेरनिटि -> जातसंस्कारो न निवर्तते -> क्रान्त अम् दर्श् इन् -> .... -> क्रान्तदर्शिन् as before and not क्रान्तदर्शयिन् as I erroneously said. Apologies for the wrong Prakriya.

  

With this in mind, I was wrong and Abhayankar Ji is correct that the word can be interpreted as क्रान्तं दर्शयति तच्छीलः. However, it is not used in the sense of a "historian" and almost always used in the sense of क्रान्तं पश्यति तच्छीलः.
