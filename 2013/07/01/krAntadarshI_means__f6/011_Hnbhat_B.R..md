Sorry for unexpected ending of message before posting.

  

The ancient usage of the word क्रान्तदर्शिन् goes back to श्रीशंकराचार्य in the sense of सर्वज्ञ, or मनीषी. वाचसपत्य though recently compiled some usages as from वेदप्रदीपः also. But none ot these favor the meaning of historian, on the other hand, favor philosophical meaning only. Any ancient usage in the sense from Abhyankar is welcome. Otherwise it is only कल्पनाविलास and not any grammatical aberration is sought to be to derive the guessed meaning for the word against the popular meaning.

  

This is the note on Abhyankar's posting and arguments.
