इदं वाचस्पत्यमत्र शब्दे।

Abhyankar has said something like "णिच्-भावः अङ्गभूतः एव इति मे मतिः \|"without going into the details of grammatical प्रक्रिया, as explained in the above image in वाचस्पत्य which does not either favor any historian or the poet. But he meant 'अन्तर्भावितण्यर्थ" if it violates the rule णिनि as given by Sri Nityanda.

  

Now a mild not on Mr. Nityananda's objection on the वाक्य as explained by Abhyankar:

  

Is it that "णेरनिटि"॥ ६।४।५१\|\| लोप is not applicable here in the case of णिनि also which is also आर्धधातुक and not a सार्वधातुक. and does not take इट् at all as it is not वलादि. And this लोप isइयङ्यण्गुणवृद्धिदीर्घाणाम् अपवादः। according to काशिका which sets a break in your प्रक्रिया :

  

t is easy to see if the विग्रह is क्रान्तं दर्शयति तच्छीलः then the word formed as per Paninian process would beक्रान्तदर्शयिन्and notक्रान्तदर्शिन्as shown below

  
  
दर्शयति is not from the root दृश्, but from the णिजन्त root दर्शि.
दृश् + णिच् = दृश् + इ (अनुबन्धलोप) = दर्श् + इ (गुण with रपरत्व by 7-3-86 पुगन्तलघूपधस्य च and 1-1-51 उरण् रपरः) = दर्शि which gets the धातु संज्ञा by 3-1-32 सनाद्यन्ता धातवः.  

  

which is so far good.

  

But "7-3-84 सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोः -> इगन्तगुण -> 1-1-50 स्थानेऽन्तरतमः -> एगुण -> क्रान्त अम् दर्शे इन् -> 6-1-78 एचोऽयवायावः -> अयादिसन्धि -> क्रान्त अम् दर्शय् इन् -> क्रान्त अम् दर्शयिन् -> 2-2-19 उपपदमतिङ् -> समास between "क्रान्त अम्" and "दर्शयिन्" -"

  

How can it be explained?

  

Just like कारयतीति कारकः, हारकः, or हरतीति हारकः, हारी, under णिनि from these words from bare stem or with णिच्?

  

Only the objection would be कल्पनागौरव as against the explanation given in वाचस्पत्य which doesn't favor the meaning "historian" nor there is any authentic usage of the word in the sense of historian. Please solve the problem with proper answer to the question "does it mean historian or not?"

  

The same thing with कल्पना too from "क्लृपि संपद्यमाने च" कल्पयतीति कल्पना, कारणा, हारणा etc. with णिच्.

  

Here is the ancient usage of the णिनि with in the same sense of णिच् according to Ramacandra budhendra, the commentator in the same sense as explained by Abhyankar:

मार्गम् = पद्धतिम्, दर्शयतीति ताच्छील्येन कवीनामिति \[शेषः or the meaning of the already explained\] मार्गदर्शी। सकलकविकुलगुरुरित्यर्थः। दृशेर्ण्यन्तात् ताच्छील्ये णिनिः। which was explained in the case of क्रान्तदर्शिन् without णिनि. But both result in the same form and not as you have suggested

  

process would beक्रान्तदर्शयिन्  

  

I am stuck in the problem. Please correct if I am wrong in my understanding.
