Dear Group,

  

Without entering into the intricacies of grammar - about which I know precious little - I may say that the plain meaning of the word is 'one who sees through or far beyond' and it is employed in most vernaculars in that sense. Any person who can foresee events beyond the immediate horizons, - a philosopher, a historian, a leader - can, by लक्षणा, be said to beक्रान्तदर्शी.
