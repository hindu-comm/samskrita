Can anyone tell me that क्रान्तदर्शी means a historian or a Seer?

Please tell me how you got the meaning "a historian" for the word. Anyhow the word was discussed in our group in different threads:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/VwjYjwoHBkA/Mzr_Z1mnGmAJ>  

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/tUbro-CgG00/jHcG6Y8TD0kJ>  

  

and some more topics you can get where the phrase is discussed in our group. But nobody suggested it is a historian.
