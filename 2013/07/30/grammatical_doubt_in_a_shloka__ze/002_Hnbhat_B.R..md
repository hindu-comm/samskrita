I don't see any reason that the singular adjective should be related with all the names mentioned in the line. And it can be conveniently related witbh Uttamaujas and there is nothing binding to relate it with the previous nouns. It is not any grammatical problem, but only of anvaya, how you related the words.



Please go through the commentaries available in this site exclusively for Bhagavadgita:
