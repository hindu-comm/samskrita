I don't think there is any need to invent a new reading as "उत्तमौजान्" as suggested by Mr. Abhyankar, which is not supported by Paninan Grammar and also not found in any readings of the Bhagavadgita and its commentaries, as I have read irrespective of Grammatical Explanation I have already given in my earlier post.

  

The basic query in this thread was nil, as there is no need to drag the proximity rule as the verse is fluent in sequence, relates the adjective with उत्तमौजस् only due to the proximity with the presence of च. There are already the same case in the previous case also where it is "काशीराजश्च वीर्यवान्" in verse 5. And why only the question with this "उत्तमौजाश्च वीर्यवान्" only? Now, here also there are two warriors, and two adjectives respectively in this particular case. "युधामन्युश्च विक्रान्तः, उत्तमौजाश्च वीर्यवान्।" which plainly means युधामन्यु, the valorous, and उत्तमौजस् also powerful. And there is not any grammatical problem here. According to Nilakantha's Bhavapradipa and other commentaries, only two warriors are mentioned in this line, and the son of सुभद्रा and the five sons of द्रौपदी making total 8 in this verse. If needed, वीर्यवान् can be taken as qualification of सौभद्र. and all are equally महारथ-s. This is the intended sense in the verse and there is no need to drag the words to and fro or invent a new reading.
