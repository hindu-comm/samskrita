Kamlesh ji Namastubhyam,

  

Sir, As mentioned in the replies below from Abhyankar ji and Arvind ji We all know that there are 10 Digpals (8 mentioned here + 1 OOrdvya and 1 Adho disha). I am not concerned much about in the shlok only 8 are mentioned, because this shlok is not meant to list all the Digpals :) As mentioned in another post. It actually creates a Magic square which is the beauty of it.

  

Moreover, I wanted to trace the source of this shlok....As at some places it is claimed that it is written by Lilawati.

  

So you are very right there are 10 Dishaas and 10 Digpals, but the question is not about that.

  

Thanks,

Alankar
