sri abhyankar ji regards,  
either your logic or calculation skills are excellent but i want to  
draw your attention that several rituals mentions 10 dikpaalas . the  
ninth dikpaala is brahmaa - thy placing is between north -east and  
east and tenth dikpaala is ananta - thy placing is between south -west  
and west.  
while offering balidaanam during graha shaanti we chant thus. --  
indraadi dash dikpaalaan saamgaan saparivaaraan saayudhaan  
sashaktikaan ebhih gandha aadi upachaaraih ahm pujayaami .  
rituals quoted is from well known book brahma nitya karma from  
valkeshwar sanskrut paathashaalaa - mumbai. and another famous book is  
gaayatri purascharana padhdhati published from mumbai .  
so there are less chances for any misconcepts. .  
regards,  
kamalesh pathak - somanaath. gujarat.
