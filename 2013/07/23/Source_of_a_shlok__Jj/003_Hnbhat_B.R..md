Dear Somanath,

  

Please be practical in your thinking and not get mystified in the name of whatever in Sanskrit.

  

1\. There are four दिशः and four corresponding विदिशः as per Mahabharata,

  

अस्माद्वायुश्चान्तरिक्षं दिवं च दिशश्चतस्रोविदिशश्चतस्रः।

सृष्टिस्तथैवेयमनुप्रसूता स निर्ममे विश्वमिदं पुराणः।। (13-263-8a 13-263-8b 13-263-8c 13-263-8d)

  

These are corresponding to the Eight Dikpala-s called by their names, also आग्नेय, नैरृत्य, etc.

  

इन्द्रो वह्निः पितृपतिर्नैरृतो वरुणो मरुत्.

कुबेर ईशः पतयःपूर्वादीनां दिशां क्रमात्. १८०।}।  

  

  

Now on counting above and below, because left and right depends on the round you take, whether it is पूर्व, or पशिम, it comes to 10 and accordingly two more deities are assigned to these two directions in addition.

  

Both are in currency irrespective of your preference.

तथा दश दिशः सर्वाः पतद गाण्डीवम आवृणॊत 12 तरस्ताश च रथिनः सर्वे बभूवुस तत्र सर्वशः सर्वे शान्ति परा भूत्वा सवचित्तानि न लेभिरे संग्रामविमुखाः सर्वे यॊधास ते हतचेतसः 1  

  

etc. and it is not good to criticize other than what you like or prefer.
