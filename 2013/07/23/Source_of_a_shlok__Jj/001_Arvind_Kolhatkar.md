Dear Group,

  

I cannot say where this verse originates but it does not appear that it originates in लीलावती, as it is not seen in any available copy of लीलावती.  As far as the internet is concerned, it has made its first appearance in the blog-entry of our friend Mr SL Abhyankar, 'Learning Sanskrit by a fresh approach – Lesson 10' at <http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/145/>. (I can say this with near-certainty because a slight inaccuracy in the blog - इन्द्र: वायुर्यमश्चैव instead of इन्द्रो वायुर्यमश्चैव - has been repeated in every place where this verse has been discussed.) Mr Abhyankar says that he first read it about 40 years ago it in a Marathi digest called अमृत.
(I believe that this monthly digest, of which I too was an avid reader, does not exist anymore.)

  

This curious verse of unverifiable origin, which just lists the names of eight दिक्पालs, yields a magic square of the first 9 natural numbers in the following manner.

  

First, arrange the names of the eight directions in rows of three in a clockwise direction, starting from वायव्य:

  

वायव्य उत्तर ईशान्य  

पश्चिम (मध्यम) पूर्व

नैऋत्य दक्षिण आग्नेय

  

Next, replace the name of each direction by its दिक्पाल:

  

वायु कुबेर ईशान

वरुण (मध्यम) इन्द्र

नैऋत यम अग्नि

  

Next, replace the name of each दिक्पाल with the sequential number at which it appear in the verse:

  

इन्द्रो(१) वायु(२)र्यम(३)श्चैव नैऋतो(४) मध्यम(५)स्तथा।

ईशान(६)श्च कुबेर(७)श्च अग्नि(८)र्वरुण(९) एव च॥

  

2 7 6

9 5 1

4 3 8

  

This is a Magic Square whose rows, columns and diagonals all add up to 15.
