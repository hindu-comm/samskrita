I tried to guess the meaning of this line by using Samskrit-English dictionaries online:

  

एतेन - by this  

मे - I/mine

निबन्धेनार्पिता - निबन्धेन + अर्पिता - record + payment

वै गुरुदक्षिणा - fees to the guru

  

So the meaning might be: By this, I record the payment of fees to (my) guru.

  

Is that the right interpretation? I still could not get the original source.  
  
V.
