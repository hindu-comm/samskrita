I tried to guess the meaning of this line by using Samskrit-English dictionaries online:  

> 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > एतेन - by this  
> > 
> > 
> > मे - I/mine >
> 
> > 
> > निबन्धेनार्पिता - निबन्धेन + अर्पिता - record + payment >
> 
> > 
> > वै गुरुदक्षिणा - fees to the guru >
> 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > So the meaning might be: By this, I record the payment of fees to (my) > guru.
> > 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > Is that the right interpretation? I still could not get the original > source.

You could not get the original meaning also with your Dictionary based guessing. For that you have some knowledge of literature also without any regard to the source, but the language.

  

It simply means:

  

The दक्षिणा to my teacher, is submitted through this essay of mine. (in the form of this composition of literary work).
