Dear All,

  

I have been trying to figure out the meaning (and source of the following text). I read it in the context of upanishads in a newspaper but despite searching for its source, I could not trace its source text.

  

एतेन मे निबन्धेनार्पितम वै गुरुदक्षिणा \|\|  

  

I will greatly appreciate if any of you could explain what it means and its source.

  

Regards,

  

V.
