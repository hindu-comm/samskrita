Dear Friends,  
  
 I have been trying for some time to find if there is any digital copy available of the Mahabharata southeren recession published by Sri Ramaswami Sastrulu and Sons, Chennai.  
  
Even though I am able to locate the southeren recession by Krishnachar and Vyasachar, I am not able to find a source for the one mentioned above. Could any one please let me know if it is available in digital form or even if an old printed version is available somewhere.  
  
  
Regards,  
  
  
Ramesh Vasudeva Rao
