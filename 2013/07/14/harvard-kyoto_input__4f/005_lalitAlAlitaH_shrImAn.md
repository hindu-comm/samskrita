Better search archive of forum and internet before asking.  
There are many tools to directly write Sanskrit(IME).  
If you wish to continue indirect typing then use I-trans to write in I-trans scheme and convert to devanAgarI.  
Anyhow, you must have searched well before asking.

Subject: \[Samskrita\] harvard-kyoto input

  
  
Respected Scholars,

  

There is a tool "ibus" in Ubuntu to type sanskrit using harvard-kyoto scheme. Is there any such tool or software for this purpose in windows. It would be of great use to me.
