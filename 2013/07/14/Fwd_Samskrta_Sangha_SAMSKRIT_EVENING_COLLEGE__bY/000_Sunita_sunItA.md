**Dear Sanskrit Enthusiasts,**

** EVENING COLLEGE FROM 2013-14**

 Karnataka Saṃskrit University \[KSU\] will be establishing an **Evening College from** academic year 2013-14.

Generally Universities are teaching Sanskrit as a language at present.
There is no opportunity to undertake traditional learning of Śāstra-s in those universities. There is no much scope for undertaking research there.   

Hence KSU will be establishing an Evening College to give opportunities to such aspirants.The College will run from **4 pm to 8 pm** every day in the premises of Sri Chamarajendra Sanskrit College, Chamarajapet, Bangalore, which is a constituent college of Sanskrit University.

 Several people get benefited by this evening college such as those who are interested in Śāstric learning but working in professional fields such as IT, BT and other professions. Several Sanskrit teachers teaching in various schools and colleges in Bangalore city but interested in advanced learning, self-employed people, women, retired people and many more can also avail of this opportunity.

The course will be on the lines of B. A. Course of a University. The student will have to learn Kannada / English and Sanskrit as compulsory languages in the first two years, apart from learning Sanskrit as the core subject in all the three years. The syllabus will consist of prose, poetry, grammar, literary history, Indian logic, philosophy, principles of dramaturgy and yoga.

  

**Qualification**: Sāhiṭya Examination in Sanskrit/12^(th) Std/Sanskrit Diploma from any University/UG-PG courses in any subject can take the admission for this course.Candidates who have attained more than 18 years of age can enroll for this course. There is no age bar.
