Nowadays in Bangalore there is sudden downpour and

also sudden disappearance of rain. Then I remember

this sloka - kuta aagatya ghatate

         vighatya kva nu yaati cha /

         na lakshyate gatischitraa

         ghanasya cha dhanasya cha //

  

From where does it come and congregate,

after disbursing where does it go and disappear.

The movement of a cloud and wealth is astonishing.
