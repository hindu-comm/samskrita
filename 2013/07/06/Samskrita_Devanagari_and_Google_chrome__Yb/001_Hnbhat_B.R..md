I recently started using Google Chrome as my browser, but I find that devanagari script in Gmail is not displayed properly.Is this the experience of others too?

I think this known to you as already it was posted some time ago when asked by some member. Anyhow try. Under Sanskrit you have got two tools, one google and the other phonetic. The first is by Google Group inbox and the other latter addition. Once the selection is made, you have save the settings in the page scrolling down to the bottom of the page "save changes" and return to Inbox.

  

  

  

This can be enabled or disabled for any other languages, including other Indian Languages also. But only you have to select the language once you have enabled the Input tools and Edited the selection of language.ಕನ್ನಡ or संस्कृत. (both are typed using IME in the inbox. For any reason if it is disabled, you cannot see the icon in the inbox and again you have to re-enable with the same procedure.
