go mukhe vasati gangA go puchchhe to sarasvati or  
gavA mangeShu tiSthanti buhvanAni chaturdashAh and  
in vriShotsarga kriyA of shrAdhdha karma there is nyAsa for cow and  
bull. viz, aghorAya namah - shirasi , nilakaNThAya namah kaNThe etc.  
some printed photoes also we see there are several gods in the body of  
a cow but which god at what part of the body - is not known.  
last year i meet a jain sAdhviji she also asked the same question and  
cow related mantras and vratAni etc, i provided at my level, she is  
founding a gaushAlA with vedic concept of science and panchagavya or  
saptagavya etc,  
i will be happy if someone from the schol;ar group post their reading  
in this regard.  
sAdara praNamya,
