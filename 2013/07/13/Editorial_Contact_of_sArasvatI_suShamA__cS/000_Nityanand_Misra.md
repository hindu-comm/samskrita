Namaste  
  
Does anybody have the editorial contact details (including phone and email), of [Sārasvatī Suṣamā](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_Susama), published by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi? Is Dr. Rajaram Shukla still the editor?  
  
I would be grateful if anybody can share them with me, on or off this mailing list.  
  
I have searched on the Internet and on SSU website but did not find the contact listing.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
