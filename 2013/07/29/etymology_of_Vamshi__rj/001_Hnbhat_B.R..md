Dear Raman,

  

Popularity or favor of names need not be looked for derivation in Sanskrit, it is left to the choice of the persons/parents concerned.

  

Any valid usage in Sanskrit Text can be asked for derivation of etymology in Sanskrit through grammar as a tool, though inefficient enough, for widely popular names. Please quote any Sanskrit usage you have found for the word with the meaning you have mentioned. Not any name found in baby name websites preferred by their loving parents.
