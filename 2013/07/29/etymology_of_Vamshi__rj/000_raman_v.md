Dear Learned members,

  

May you kindly comment upon the etymology of the word "Vamshi" whose meaning in the dictionary is given as bamboo reed. It is popularly referred to as the flute beheld by Lord Krishna. Also, this word is a popular choice of boy's name. Any comment on its root would be appreciated.

  

Regards

raman
