Probably V.Raman's query "kindly comment upon the etymology of the word "Vamshi" whose meaning in the dictionary is given as bamboo reed" and his choice of the word "etymology" is not in agreement with the his purpose, which is to find out whether 'Vamshi" is suitable as a boy's name. He perhaps does not the need the etymology but just advice about its meaning.

  

If that be so, I would say that the word is not appropriate as a boy's name. Vamshi, like its other synonyms 'Muralee,' VeNu' Bansuree' (Hindi), 'Baasaree' (Marathi) is of the feminine gender. For 'Vamshee' to be masculine, its original would have to be 'Vamshin', which it is not. therefore, in my view, it is not appropriate as a boy's name, despite the fact that fond parents are indiscriminately conferring it upon their darlings.
