Taken this view as granted, the shortened name could not be declined either as the feminine word वंशी or a masculine word, which it is not in fact, used in Sanskrit as ईकारन्त masculine word, which only would suggest वंशी in languages without inflection, it stands for वंशीधर, or वंशीकृष्ण. So etymology for the name वंशी could not be sought from Sanskrit usage, but only from the regional languages, in which it is used as shortened pet name for their boy by the parents (may some close friends or relatives call him, but never declined in Sanskrit as masculine name or forced etymology may result in misuse of Sanskrit etymology and grammar against the popular usage in Sanskrit meaning flute.)
