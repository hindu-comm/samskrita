namaste,

  

The outpourings of Rishis are not ordinary compositions. Though derivations and nirukta allow us to approach these compositions, there are often much deeper meanings that yogis are able to unlock. Words like 'chamunda' fall into this category. A few days ago, a yogi made the following comment on the meaning of 'chamunda'. If you look at the symbolism of the saptashati, this derivation is particularly appropriate.

  

  

"The verb cham means to drink/eat/consume. The verb mund means to shave or deplete. Chamunda means one who drinks and finishes. Rakta means conditioning or coloring (the words rakti (attachment) and virakti (detachment) come from the same root). Rakta Chamunda is the one who drinks and empties all conditioning that causes desires."

  

  

You can read the comment, in context, from<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/9508>

  

\[ Incidentally, this yogi will be in the California Bay Area this weekend doing a public Chandi homam at 8:30 am on Aug 3, and will be giving a spiritual talk at 4pm on Aug 4th ... both at the Santa Clara Mahakaleshwar temple <http://srimahakalmandir.org/>. My apologies for the unrelated content \]

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
