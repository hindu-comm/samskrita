You can refer to any Standard Dictionary for the purpose available online:  
  
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/>  
  
or Apte's Pasctical Dictionary:  
  
<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/apte/>  
  
if you know how to look a word in the Dictionary. Flatly a question  
like this I want Sanskrit origin doesn't mean anything, without the  
context from where you found the word.
