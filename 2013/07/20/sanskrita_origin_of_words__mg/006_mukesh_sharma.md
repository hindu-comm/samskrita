Thanks all for Reply.

  

I am sorry i realized i should have mentioned the context. Actually we are searching for a name for our baby Girl. We always wanted a baby Girl and i guess "Ipsita" means desired(Ipsa is desire i learnt) so that is one name we have finalized. I just wanted to confirm if this word really means this.

About "Ikshita" i just loved the phonetics of it and since it's similar to Ipsita, while searching over net this also came across us. But i am not sure about the meaning of this. It is probably synonym of Isht as in Isht Dev.

Need help.

  

Thanks.
