So it is not any real query for meaning, but love for his baby name only as I had guessed. He loved some baby name seeming to him Sanskrit he got from his baby name search and posted for asking about derivation of it.

OK. Please go through my reply once again for the word you have requested. Anyhow I agree with Arvind, this forum is not to be misused as a baby name inventing site.
