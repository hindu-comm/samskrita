sanskrit is divine language, dEva bhaasha  
  

I am afraid, calling Sanskrit s divine language or deva bhasha is the surest way of keeping the language away from the masses! We'll have to wait till masses become 'deva's!

Uday,

I have gone through the links. But none talks of role played by sanskrit  
for computer language. As NASA told that they have been doing research on this,  
I want to know whether even ISRO or any other Indian Organization working on the  
same. Thanks.  

\<==  
  
and from your further clarification, offline to myself  
\<==  
As how the binaries are first converted to assembly language(in english),  
  
I thought the same can be done with sanskrit(where assembly language will  
now be written in sanskrit).  
I dont know how complex this task is!  
\<==  
  
The harsh reality is, that there is no NASA research program into Sanskrit  
as an assembly language. Not at NASA, in India, or anywhere else - and for good  
reason.  
  
You appear to be confusing the undisputed and unambiguous logic of Pāṇini's  
Treatise of the language, with the language so treated.  
The first is indeed unambiguous, the second most certainly not, indeed many  
works of literature, especially of the more poetic variety were deliberately  
composed as ambiguously as possible for the entertainment of and appreciation of  
the learned.  
One only as to glance through the discussions in this forum to realise the  
truth of that. Many of the discussions are concerned with reconciling the  
various, often contradictory interpretations of the authoritative commentaries  
on the same classical texts. Even with regard to Pāṇini's Treatise, scholars  
delight in discovering an occasional ambiguity.  
I'm having to read your mind, here, but were you inspired by the assertions  
made in an AI-Magazine, that Sanskrit is the ideal language for 'computer  
usage', 'because it is unambiguous'?  
  
As to the complexity of writing an assembler in Sanskrit, it wouldn't be  
very complex at all.  
Here is an MSDOS version of the famous Hello World program that a learner  
gets to write as his very first program, within the five minutes or so of study.  
  
  
; Hello World for Intel Assembler (MSDOS)  
mov ax,cs  
mov ds,ax  
mov ah,9  
mov dx, offset Hello  
int 21h  
xor ax,ax  
int 21h  
Hello:  
db "Hello World!",13,10,"$"  
  
All anyone has to do is to write the assembly language instructions, mov,  
int, xor, db etc in Sanskrit. But why would anyone want to?  
What Sanskrit words you to use for move, interrupt, exclusive or, debug  
etc? Then there would be the little matter of international agreement for the  
ANSI standard.  
And the Sanskrit for 'exclusive or', or the 'debug' command to compile  
those instructions?  
  
By the way, it's the other way around - you first write the instructions in  
assembly language (in Sanskrit, if you must), then compile ('convert') them into  
the executable ('the binary).  
Nowadays, since the development of High Level languages, instructions can  
be written in a more human friendly manner, more or less in the same way that we  
speak. Although in a somewhat curt manner, and with a very limited and agreed  
vocabulary.  
Each such computer language being necessarily a somewhat (very!) simplified  
version of a native language, be it English or Sanskrit or Arabic or Russian.  
  
Communication with machines in the same way as communicating with humans is  
fraught with difficulties, not least because it is rich in ambiguities,  
innuendoes etc. not to mention jokes and insults, Sanskrit being no exception.  
  
Just how suitable is artha for example, as an unambiguous term for Object  
as in Object Oriented Programming.  
  
As to that article on the non-existent NASA research program into Sanskrit.  
  
You appear to have been inspired by an example of fan magazine feel-good  
style of writing. Let the reader beware! First, debug liberally with a little  
home grown pre-processing power - thought.  
The article quoted is on a web site - devoted to Sanskrit. The article  
itself being written by individual on his own behalf, a Rick Briggs, who, as an  
individual just happens to work as ‘a senior research Scientist with NASA who  
specializes in Artificial Intelligence (Computer Languages etc)’.  
The said article appears in a, shall we say, 'popular' AI Magazine, where  
Briggs extols the many virtues of Sanskrit etc. albeit without substantiating a  
single one of his assertions, which as a ‘scientist’ he should be ashamed of  
himself.  
and - bemoans the fact that NASA does NOT look into Sanskrit as a computer  
language.
