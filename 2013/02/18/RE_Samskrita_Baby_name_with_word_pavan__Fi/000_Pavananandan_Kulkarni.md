Subject: \[Samskrita\] Baby name with word 'pavan'  
  
Dear scholars,  
  
We need a baby name with the word 'pavan'. From the dictionary I  
learnt that pavan means pure, god of Wind etc. We came up with names  
like Pavan Kumar (Sri Hanuman), Hemant Pavan (Cold Breeze) etc. Could  
you suggest some more creative names, names about Hanuman or names  
with Pavan...  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
