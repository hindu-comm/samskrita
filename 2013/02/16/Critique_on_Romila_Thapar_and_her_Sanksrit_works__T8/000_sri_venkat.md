Dear Members  
  
This is relevant to the group as Romila Thapar is considered a  
respected authority on some of our Sanskrit texts.  
  
Wagish Shukla details how Romila Thapar only relies on translations of  
Sanskrit texts and totally distorts the meanings, to suit her line of  
thinking.  
  
Please go thru the excellent analysis by Wagish Shukla in the attachment.
