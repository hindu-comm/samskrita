Respected Scholars,  
Please accept my greetings.  
  
I am writing this e-mail to you to get answer for a query about Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa. And also I want to know more about Śrī Viṣṇucitta.  
  
VP 5.18.57 states that, viśvaṁ bhavān sṛjati sūrya-gabhasti-rūpo. Commenting on this part of the verse Śrila Śrīdhara Svāmī writes, sūrya-raśmi-rūpeṇa varṣayan bhavān carācaraṁ viśvaṁ sṛjati, while Śrī Viṣṇucitta writes, sūrya-gabhasti-rūpo bhūtvā vṛṣṭidvārā viśvaṁ sṛjati.  
  
I started reading directly from 5th aṁśa of VP, instead of reading from the beginning, as it deals with the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. But I tried to search the sections of VP and also Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam where the creation of the universe is mentioned; however I couldn’t find such description. So may I request the scholars of this group to put some light on how Lord Viṣṇu created the universe while raining through sunrays? Also if this topic is previously discussed in this group or somewhere else, then I will be thankful if you please provide me the link.  
  
Also, I am referring a commentary of Śrī Viṣṇucitta while reading VP. I feel he is the same famous Śrī Vaiṣṇava devotee; however someone told me that this Viṣṇucitta is different. So I request the scholarly members of this group to shed some light on Śrī Viṣṇucitta, the commentator of VP.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Yours sincerely,  
Prasad J.
