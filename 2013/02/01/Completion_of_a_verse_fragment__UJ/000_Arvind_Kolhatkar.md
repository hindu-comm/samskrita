Dear Scholars,

  

I remember a fragment of a verse and the story associated with it. The fragment is एतन्मया कथमहो कृतमित्यकस्मात् and the story is that upon creating the Universe, ब्रह्मा was astounded by seeing what he had created and the verse sponteneously came out of his mouth.

  

Through Google I could reach a site (<http://marathivishwakosh.in/khandas/khand14/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10497&limitstart=3>) which says that the line एतन्मया कथमहो कृतमित्यकस्मात्कर्ताऽपि यस्यखलु विस्मयमाप शिल्पी is found in the Ellora Caves and refers to the thought in the mind of the architect/sculpture when he saw his creation.

  

I do not think this is trustworthy. The website does not give any verifiable reference. Also, inscriptions found in ancient sites almost always extol the munificence of the king or the donor who supported or financed the creation of the work and the architect/sculpture is hardly ever mentioned.

  

Does any scholar in this Group fill up the second line of the verse and recount the story behind it?
