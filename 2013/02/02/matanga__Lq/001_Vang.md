**Dear members of this community, respected scholars!**

  

I am a young student of Sanskrit philology and tantric Buddhism at the University of Hamburg,Germany.As I am working on a new edition of the Sanskrit text of Saroruha's *Hevajrasādhanopāyikā,*

whichwill be mainly based upon a version of this text contained in the *Hevajrasādhanasaṃgraha* codex,I would like to obtain a copy of a particularMS titled ***Sādhanasaṃgraha***which is said to be

inthe privatepossession of a certain Ṭhākursen Negī in India (most likely in Sarnath). A copy of this MS has beenused for the edition of this Hevajrasādhana which has been published in Dhīḥ Vol.

36in 2003. As the Dhīḥ edition unfortunately contains a high amount of corruptions, a new edition ofSaroruha's*Hevajrasādhanopāyikā*based on all extant Sanskrit sources as well as the canonical

Tibetan translation will be indeed very useful, and thus I would like to ask for your help to obtain a copy of this certain MS mentioned above, which was given the *siglum* K in the Dhīḥ edition of 2003.

For any help, I willremain deeply grateful!

  

  

With kind regards,

  

*Torsten*
