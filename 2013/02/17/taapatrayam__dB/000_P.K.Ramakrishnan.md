taapa-trayam



Three kinds of miseries.



अध्यात्मिकम्, अधिभौतिकम्, अधिदैविकम्



1. AdhyAtmika - the afflictions related to the gross and subtle bodies (sthUla and sUkShma sharIras) like hunger and thirst (related to prANa), desire, anger, jealousy etc. (related to the mind) and dilemma, doubt, confusion etc.

(related to the intellect).  



2. Adhibhautika - these are afflictions that arise from sources apart from oneself and are available to one's perception. Examples are: attacks from wild animals or pests, terrorist strikes, wars, attack from enemies etc.



3. Adhidaivika - these are caused by supernatural forces, over which one does not have any control. Examples are: thunders, earthquakes, snowstorms, landslides, epidemics etc.
