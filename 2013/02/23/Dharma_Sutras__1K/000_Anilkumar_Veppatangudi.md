After successfully conducting National Seminars on Vivaha Samskara in Mysore in Oct 2011 and Shulba Sutras & Mathematics in Bangalore in Sep 2012, Kalpa Heritage Trust is planning to conduct a National Seminar on Dharma Sutras and their relevance to Contemporary Politics during July/Sep 2013 in Bangalore. Details of scholars well versed in Dharma Sutras would be welcomed. Also, suggestions about the format of the 2-day seminar would be appreciated.

With regards,  

Dr.V.R.Anil Kumar
