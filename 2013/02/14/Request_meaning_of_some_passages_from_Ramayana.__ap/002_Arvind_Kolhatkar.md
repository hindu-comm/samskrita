Dear Ramakrishnanji,

  

\<Hanuman speaks -

तस्य मां सचिवं वित्तं...>

  

I remember from school grammar that the suffixes for the imperativemood for धातुs in 2.P. in the second person are 'हि तस् त'. So 'या' 'to go'conjugates as 'याहि यातम् यात' and विद् conjugates as 'विद्धि वित्तम् वित्त'. 'तस्य मां सचिवं वित्तं' will translate as 'you (two) should know me as his सचिव'.  

  

\<Srirama speaks -

नानृग्वेदविनीतस्य नायजुर्वेदधारिण: /

नासामवेदविदुष: शक्यमेवं प्रभाषितुम्//>

  

'ऋग्वेदविनीत' is someone who has studiedऋग्वेद and अनृग्वेदविनीत is someone who is ignorant ofऋग्वेद and similarly for यजुर्वेद andसामवेद.
The verse translates as 'Speaking in such a wise manner is not possible for someone who is not learned in ऋग्वेद, यजुर्वेद and सामवेद.
