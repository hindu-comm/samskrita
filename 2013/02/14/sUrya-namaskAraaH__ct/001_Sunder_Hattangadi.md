**Monier-Williams calls #marIci "a particle of light", a sunray. It is a term that he found only in \_taittirIya-araNyaka. In RV he reads "ray of Light".**

**M-W did not read much of Yoga-Vasishtha when compiling his dictionary (I have only encountered one citation in many years.) YV frequently associates maRici and #prANa--offering an image of the Prânic current that looks remarkably like the current in my computer!**

**???  With whichposture is \_marIci assocated? (Please describe it.)**
