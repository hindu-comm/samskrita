Dear friends,

  

It is not the question of the meaning of the word मरीचि, or its declined forms.

  

The question was how and why it is used as the epithet for सूर्य as in the Suryanamaskara mantra. While the word मरीचि does not have the meaning or is used as epithet for सूर्य, the son of काश्यप, whose father is also called मरीचि (according to the sources cited, he is the father of काश्यप, who is in turn is the father of सूर्य - काश्यपेय), the word मरीचिन् is used as epithet for सूर्य (though literally - anyone having rays, i.e. the Sun) according to the sources cited. So the question is about the source of the सूर्यनमस्कारमन्त्र-s found all over the web pages with the same reading मरीचये नमः which would mean salutations to मरीचिः and not to his descendant the Sun, काश्यपेय मरीचि. This is the purpose of the question. If it should mean salutations to the sun, it could have been मरीचिने नमः - चतुर्थी विभक्ति of मरीचिन् which is directly referring to the Sun, or otherwise मरीचिमालिन्, or सहस्ररश्मि.

  

If the source could not be traced to any authentic Puranic source or Vedic source, it could be मरीचिने नमः as suggested by the member. Please try to find any authentic source for the mantra. If it is authentic source, we can simply accept the meaning "the Sun" for the same word मरीचि. Otherwise it need not be मरीचये also which doesn't give the meaning "the Sun". This is the point raised by the member. I could not find the source on the net for the mantra-s, but only as a list of नमः with 12 names.

  

They are not the same as the 12 names of आदित्य-s:

  

dhātāryamā ca mitraśca ***varuṇo'ṃśu***r bhagas tathā / (55.1) 

indro vivasvān pūṣā ca tvaṣṭā ca savitā tathā // (55.2)

parjanyaścaiva viṣṇuśca ādityāḥ pāvakārciṣaḥ / (56.1)

ityete dvādaśādityā jvalantaḥ sūryavarcasaḥ / (56.2)

  

  

धातार्यमा च मित्रश्च वरुणोंऽशुर्भगस्तथा / (५५.१) 

इन्द्रो विवस्वान् पूषा च त्वष्टा च सविता तथा // (५५.२)

पर्जन्यश्चैव विष्णुश्च आदित्याः पावकार्चिषः / (५६.१)

इत्येते द्वादशादित्या ज्वलन्तः सूर्यवर्चसः / (५६.२)

  

But this list is different from the above.

  

ॐ मित्राय नमः।

ॐ रवये नमः।

ॐ सूर्याय नमः।

ॐ भानवे नमः।

ॐ खगाय नमः।

ॐ पुषणे नमः। - पूष्णे

 

ॐ हिरण्यगर्भाय नमः।

ॐ मरीचये नमः।

ॐ आदित्याय नमः।

ॐ सवित्रे नमः।

ॐ अर्काय नमः।

ॐ भास्कराय नमः।

ॐ श्रीसवित्रसूर्यनारायणाय नमः। - सवितृ-

॥ आदित्यस्य नमस्कारन् ये कुर्वन्ति दिने दिने\| नमस्कारान्

आयुः प्रज्ञा बलम् वीर्यम् तेजस्तेशान् च जायते ॥ स्तेषां

  

The above is a list from one web page. This also contains a wrong form highlighted in red and correct form suggested in green against each. 
It is not the form in question, but the question is about the meaning of the word proper to the collocation of the other epithets in the list, meaning "The sun".

  

With regards
