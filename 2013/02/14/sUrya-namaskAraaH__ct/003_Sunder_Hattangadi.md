marIchiH is name #189 in Vishnu sahasranamavali.

  

The following reference may need further clarification.

  

  

<http://kirtimukha.com/chinnamma/sahasra/sloka21.html#21.191> -

  

marIcih

  

21.191 - marIcih 

  

Ray of light.

  

Om marIcaye namah.

  

The word marIci means a ray of light. SrI Bhattar interprets this nameas indicating that bhagavAn reveals Himself to His devotees throughthe eye of their devotion even though they can't see Him through theirnatural eye.

The author in dharma cakram indicates that this guNa of bhagavAnshould remind us that we should aim for the ray of light that will helpus meditate on Him. This we can achieveby first controlling our indriya-s,which then converts the body's energies into mental energy. Then bycontrol of the mind, this energy is converted into the light that gives the

clarity of mind that can help us meditate on Him.

A different interpretation is given by SrI satyadevo vAsishThafor this nAma. The word marIci is derived from mR prANatyAge to die,to perish. He interprets marIci as one who destroys. Since it is oneof bhagavAn's functions to destroy the beings that He creates, He is marIci.

To support this, he gives the examples from bhagavad-gItA -

jAtasya hi dhruvo mRtyur-dhruvam janma mRtasya ca (2.25);

mRtyuh prajAnAm adhipatih (atharva 5.24.13), etc.
