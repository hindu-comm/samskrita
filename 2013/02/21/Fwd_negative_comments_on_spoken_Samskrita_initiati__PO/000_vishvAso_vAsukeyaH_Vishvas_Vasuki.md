Subject: negative comments on spoken Samskrita initiative  
  
  
Apparently according to Dr. Stella Sandahl, Samskrita revivalists are interested in "cutting throats", "raping nuns", "destroying mosques", etc. This preposterous and extremely offensive allegation was made in an academic e-list no less, eliciting a couple of muted protests. Dr. Sandahl also makes the equally outrageous allegation that Samskrita revivalists are all proponents of the Hindutva political movement.

Here we find one Dr. Maheswaran Nair positing that Samskrita speakers are wannabe mass-murderers.

Prof. Sheldon Pollock in an interview (available on youtube) also made some comments against the spoken Samskrita movement, though he was relatively subdued. His thesis being what I indicated earlier - spoken Samskrita doesn't do justice to a language of high intellectual output.  
  
I read those papers you have linked. I must give credit to Dr. Hastings for presenting a picture that is relatively objective notwithstanding what I see as his apparent predilections and amusing over-analysis of a book of simple sentences.  
  
For better or for worse, I have gradually come around to finding some merit in the observation made by shrI L Aravind, as elucidated earlier over at Facebook. He has on more than one occasion spoken of organized efforts at certain places to sequester Indic knowledge systems from its natural milieu while also working to stymie its survival therein. Unfortunately, until and unless certain trends take a favorable turn, specially in India, I am hard-pressed to see things change for the better.
