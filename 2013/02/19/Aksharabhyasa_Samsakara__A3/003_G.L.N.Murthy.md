Yes.Famous Telugu Literary history writer Late Sri Arudra was also of the same opinion.It is a prayer from Jaina sidhas and not the original Teugu Akshrabhyasam.Telugu jateeyam is (Onamaalu diddadam)-Learnign Om.Namha Sivaya writing frist before learning Alphabet,because the words originated from Lord Shiva only.-I am not a sanskrit scholar.Please enlighten me if any mistakes are there-Ganti Lakshminarayana Murthy(Bangalore).
