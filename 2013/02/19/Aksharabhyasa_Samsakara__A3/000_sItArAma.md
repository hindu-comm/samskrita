Dear Scholars,

I recently witnessed an Aksharabhyasa Samsakara. Where father held son's hand and made him write letters / words on a slate for the first time.

Everybody might have different regional flavor of same concept.

  

The priest told to write " ओ ना म: , शिवाय:, सिद्धं नम: " I am not exaggerating anything this is exactly how the priest told and the person followed like a robot, without questioning.  

I think the more appropriate sentence would be to write " ॐ नम: शिवाय, सिद्धं नम: "

  

I was wondering if scholars can give any reference to this ritual and point me to the correct sentence.

The first part is pretty clear, I could not understand what does सिद्धं नम: mean?

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

PS: - This ritual was done in a Telugu family, People sure can tell how its done in other regions as well.
