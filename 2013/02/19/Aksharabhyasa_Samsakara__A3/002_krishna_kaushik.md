you remind me of my childhood (many scores of years ago...)  
I remember this aged and very dutiful religious man, who used to perform tarpaNa every morning...  
still in his wet clothes after his bath, holding his brass kalasha in both hands, he used recite loudly -  
ओ ना मासि धम्म् - much later, when I reached the university, it dawned on me that the old man used to say,  
ॐ नाम सिद्धम्
