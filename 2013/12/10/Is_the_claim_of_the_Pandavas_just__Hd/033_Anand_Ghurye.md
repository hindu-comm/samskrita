One correction .  
  

The reference in by Pandit Dixit is to Mahabharata . He says in his book " Nowhere in the Mahabharata is found a single reference to Yoga , Karana or Rasi . " His opinion is about Mahabharata and we are taking a reference of Rashi from Ramayana . Am I missing something here ?  
  

Secondly just a few lines given above , Pandit Dixit talks about two eclipses in 13 days reference given in Mahabharata . Two eclipses in same location in 13 days time is a rarity and can be used for timing of Mahabharata .
