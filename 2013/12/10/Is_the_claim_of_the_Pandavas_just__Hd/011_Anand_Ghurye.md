Dear friends ,  
  

As I see from the sabhaparva  
  
"Sakuni then said,--'The old king hath given ye back all your wealth. That is well. But, O bull of the Bharata race, listen to me, there is a stake of great value. Either defeated by ye at dice, dressed in deer skins we shall enter the great forest and live there for twelve years passing the whole of the thirteenth year in some inhabited region, unrecognised, and if recognised return to an exile of another twelve years; or vanquished by us, dressed in deer skins ye shall, with Krishna, live for twelve years in the woods passing the whole of the thirteenth year unrecognised, in some inhabited region. If recognised, an exile of another twelve years is to be the consequence. On the expiry of the thirteenth year, each is to have his kingdom surrendered by the other. O Yudhishthira, with this resolution, play with us, O Bharata, casting the dice.'  
  

The sanskrit shlokas are  
  
 9 वयं दवादश वर्षाणि युष्माभिर दयूतनिर्जिताः  
 परविशेम महारण्यं रौरवाजिनवाससः  
10 तरयॊदशं च सजने अज्ञाताः परिवत्सरम  
 जञाताश च पुनर अन्यानि वने वर्षाणि दवादश  
11 अस्माभिर वा जिता यूयं वने वर्षाणि दवादश  
 वसध्वं कृष्णया सार्धम अजिनैः परतिवासिताः  
12 तरयॊदशे च निर्वृत्ते पुनर एव यथॊचितम  
 सवराज्यं परतिपत्तव्यम इतरैर अथ वेतरैः

As per this , if the pandavas are successful in the Adnyatvas then their kingdom was to be given back . This promise Duryodhan refused to keep . Hence the war became necessary .  
  

Dear group members please let me know on the right track .
