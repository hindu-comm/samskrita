A much debated question - I know we don't have to reply to this question to the original "asker" - but i had been wondering about this for quite sometime too and read up a little on this, hence i thought i would put down my thoughts. :) . Quite common sentiments all across the debates too :)  
  
Based on eldest son will be king rule - Duryodhana should be the rightful heir.

  

1\. Dhritarashtra gives kingdom/rule to Pandu. If Pandu had children when he was ruling, they should be the heir. But Pandu is childless.

2\. Pandu then hnds over the kingdom / rule to Dhritarashtra and takes up vanavasa. So when he has his children, he is no longer the king.  
  

And therefore Duryodhana should get the kingdom by right of primogeniture. But, (and always someone's but-ting :P )  
  

Even though Dhritarashtra was elder, he was advised / pressured / told by the advisors to hand over the rule to Pandu. Similarly, with the Pandavas and KAuravas under the gurus, upon seeing the righteousness of the pandavas, Drona and Bhishma advise Dhritarashtra to give the rule to them.  
  

Dhritarashtra was asked to give up his rule due to a physical shortcoming, and he was asked to give up his eldest son's right due to a moral/ behavioural shortcoming  

  
  

So that's what i could learn about the right to rule...  
  

Now about the names, this is very interesting by itself :)  
  
I read that the names were suyodhana, which means great warrior and duryodhana means the one who is difficult to fight and win against. We have this popular perception of using "Dur" for anything bad.. and hence we give it a negative spin....  
  
Interesting to read and interesting to perceive :)
