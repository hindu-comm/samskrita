With due regard to scholars in this group, I am extremely reluctant to enter into arguments. These are all matters where different views can be held by different people without any of the views being capable of being proved or disproved.

For all I know, Vyasa could himself be a fictional character. It is highly improbable that one person wrote all the Puranas and the Mahabharata, especially when methods of writing were very crude.

A set of books on mathematics dealing with the fundamentals of mathematics has been written by one called Bourbaki. Those who know, know that Bourbaki never existed. A group of mathemticians created "Bourbaki".

In historical novels dates are precisely mentioned and fiction is intermixed with what really happened. That does not prove that historical novels are not fiction.

Novelists often create a frame work of some one writing the novel, which is also a part of the fiction. In Kannada DVG has created a frame work where a person called Timma composes the verses called "Mankutimmana kagga". Again,there is in Kannada Ramasvamedha, written in "old Kannada" by "Muddana". Muddana is a fictional character created by the real author, Nadalike Naranappa.I am sure there would be similar instances in English and other languages.

There have been attempts, in my view meaningless, to identify "Malgudi" of RK Narayan or "Egdon Heath" of Thomas Hardy. In the same manner we can identify times and places mentioned in Mahabharata and Puranas. That does not prove anything.

As regards astronomical calculations based on what is given in epics and Puranas, I have been told, (I am subject to correction and I am not sure on this) that it is not possible to correctly calculate backwords planetary events.

Regards

Murthy
