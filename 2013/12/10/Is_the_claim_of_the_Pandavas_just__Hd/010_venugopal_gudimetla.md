Suresh ji, I agree with you. Imagine, for 2500 years, India had no scholar worth his salt who could think of this, even gurus such as Adi-Sankara et al didn't think about this. They simply wanted the "bad kauravas" to pay at the cost of Dharma or not, may be there is deep seated conspiracy against Kauravas who knows great gurus themselves got stumped. We certainly have matured now to attribute treachery to Pandavas of all things. I thought I heard it all.  
  
Regards,  
Venu
