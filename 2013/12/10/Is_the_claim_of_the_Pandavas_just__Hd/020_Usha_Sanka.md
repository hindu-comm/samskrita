It is not kaliyuga we are talking about. Its dvApara yuga. There are accepted ways of getting children, that too for a purpose of pANDu, to reach heaven. he was denied it, just because he was childless. But was cursed. So he adopts a very appropriate method to get children.

By whom? Us? People of this era? What about yuga dharma?

What part of his role in mahAbhArata made you "feel" so?

Then why did he fight wars in honour of kingdom? Why did he bring brides for vicitravIrya? Why did he always work to protect kingdom? Why was he a War-Head in the Great mahAbhArata war and die?

Why did he do that?

Oath was for life long. Not just till his father's death. It was related to throne and was a question of kingdom as a whole, not just his person.

Did he not know it while taking oath?

It ended long back in vyAsa's story. There is no more any war. All dhArtarAShTras died in war and pANDavas ruled the kingdom.. and after doing their duties well, they went off to svarga.

He went to forest, just for spending some time after serious series of wars. Kingdom was just entrusted to his brother.

There was no duryodhana before yudhiSThira was born. duryodhana came later.
