Happy to know this. These days not many people care about the Epics.

I Confess- not much learned though, I will try.

It is fact. No body forced that upon us. vyAsa just describes the series of events and his job is done. One who has the knowledge of dharmAdharma can easily make out the difference. Source books are to be referred.

Which Indian source for this statement? Please do not apply rules of Non-Indian on संस्कृतवाङ्मयम्। vyAsa is the writer. I do not think he fought the war. Everyone follows "Be a Roman in Rome.." So, similarly- "Be Indian to *understand* Indian things." That would answer your question about this issue as well as many other similar ones, too.

True. Indeed.

No - pANDu did. dhrRtarAShTra was blind. Never a fit candidate for king-hood.

What base for this decision of yours? Which dharma-ShAstra declared this? dhrRtarAShTra himself was aware that he is not the real king.. was only playing "king" when pANDu had gone for "jaitra yAtrA" . After returning- pANDu was given back his duty.

No- He was THE CROWNED KING.

No way. If his father were the king, he would get a chance. But blind father left him no chance. He regretted that all his life.

yudhishThira was the eldest among the KuruVamsha next generation. pANDu was crowned king. He put his elder brother only as an in-charge. Then he died of ShApa. So his sons are rightful owners. duryodhana was only taking advantage of the situation. Otherwise why would he try to kill the pANDavas with so many odd plans and unfair ways? Because he was aware of his no-right thing. If he were rightful, he would have approached elders to do him justice.

What about Lava-Kusha of rAmAyaNa?

What base? Any reference to King-hood codes in any dharma-shAstra? Please quote for this statement.

We need not. The epic does the justification job. Can read the "udyoga parva" for clarification.

On basis of dharmaShAstras. All decisions were took on only one base in Old India. Even today - we follow that books for present day Laws.  
  
The rishis and munis had brought pANDavas to the kingdom declaring them the successors of pANDu after pANDu's death in the forest. The munis cannot be charged of not studying dharma-ShAstras. Do they? Then, are all dharmaShAstras are lies too?

Please stop looking at issues related to India in non-Indian grounding. This is unfair. What if we start to "judge" so many issues where non-Indians are "wrong" according to Indian Rules? Will that be appreciated?

Great. Yes. All kings were aware of all dharmas. They were perfect people as kings. But dhRtarASTra was a blind father. Never tried to do justice to pANDavas when his son was openly trying to kill them. pANDavas were silent- they never asked for justice. It was others who fought for them. Eg.. Vidura.

They were very well aware of fighting war the adharma side. And were literally ashamed inside. Reference- Bhishma's speech on the bed of arrows. He clearly mentions this point.

Yes. Duryodhana took great care while preparing for war. Even pANDava's side people were supporting him. That's rAjanIti of duryodhana.

vyAsa gives reasons for his backing-up throughout the epic. Krishna is always where dharma is. Please refer original epic sources. (I can do it for you- but some time needed.)  
In fact, when everyone was prepared to kill duryodhana because of his ill-traits been discovered right at his birth by jyotiSha, it was vyAsa who backed him up and stopped them who wanted to kill him by mentioning need of keeping duryodhana alive.

Yes. Very much. Very brutal, and well-planned and designed treachery. They are enough for filing a non-bailable case against duryodhana.

Good question. Need some thinking. May be- their traits at time of birth- revealed their nature. Its jyotiSha that helped people decide this issue..?

I repeat- vyAsa is the writer. I do not think he fought the war. pANDavas need to be writers.. or makers of mahAbhArata for your statement to be true. And why would yudhiShThira wail so much after war- if he cherished the war?

Does this not raise any doubt in you, that it might be your own wrong viewing of the issue?

There is an immediate need to *change your vision, not facts*- to suit your conclusions. Much background of dharma-adharma knowledge is needed before deciding upon these issues. There are many नीतिशास्त्रs, धर्मग्रन्थs.. PLEASE Read mahAbhArata epic original. Your doubts should be cleared. All the best.
