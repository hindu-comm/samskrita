Shri Arvind Mahodaya,  
Firstly primogeniture alone doesn't decide who should succeed. The first dharma of a king is to protect his subjects, his kingdom and the dharma. Dhritarashtra was born blind. Even though this is not something he is responsible for, but this certainly will hinder in his duties as a king. You, yourself have mentioned that Pandu helped him in taking care of his Kingdom. This was one of the reasons that he was not the chosen for the kingdom. If that is the case, the throne doesn't belong to him to be given away by primogeniture of Duryodhana. And treachery is on the part of Kauravas that they denied even 5 villages to Pandavas and even were tried to be killed mercilessly multiple times, not to forget the disrobing of Panchali, the intrigue behind burning of lakgruha to kill the Pandavas.

Dhritarashtra had his own demons. He was not only blind, but he also blinded by his affection to Duryodhana. Vidhura repeatedly cautioned him about the adharmic acts of Duryodhana and yet his blind love for his son prevented him from taking action or from admonishing his son. Duryodhana in the process collects some of the very dark characters of that era around him. And you rightly pointed out as we know, there will be always few dharmic men who aligned with padavas. Certainly Dhrona, Bheeshma and the like were with Kauravas not because they were loyal to the Kauravas, but it was their dharmic duty which bound them to the kingdom. For example Bheeshma took the oath to protect the king whoever ruled Hastinapura.

Secondly, even though you quoted Mauryans, don' t know why you missed Asoka and Chandragupta. Primogeniture didn't play a part when they were made kings. Even in Artha sastra, Kautilya stresses the importance of the king to uphold dharma and his ability to defend his kingdom and his subjects. My examples are given without much research. One can research more to show that Primogeniture even though is important in Indian context, it is not the only deciding factor when it comes to someone to be declared the king.

Just curious which version of Mahabharata did you read? Is it vyasa? Among other things, how you understand it depends on your perspective, you need not take Mahabharata to be a true story, but if you consider it as a lesson in dharma and each character has a role, you might reconcile with the names, roles and parts they played. Reading Mahabharata alone might not give you all the answers, you may have to refer to other puranas for reasons.

Say you are stinking rich, have zillions of $ and estates to protect and you are very zealous about your hard earned estate, and say you have 3 sons, and say the first one is handicapped and depends on his siblings for support and he cannot do much alone, and if your estate is in the crosshairs of your rivals, whom do you think you will give your estate?

Regards,  
Venu
