There were NOT many people who used to have the syndrome of "know it all" till recent times. When we try to interpret "Mahabharata" with current social context, without understanding the social and spiritual context during the period, it is no wonder such questionable questions can arise. Before going down that path of questioning the wisdom of many many many many.........people, we have to have humbleness of questioning our "know it all" syndrome, then we will get the correct interpretation skills. I don't think one lifetime is enough to understand the depth of Bhagavadgeeta. Somewhere I heard that Mahabharata is the Practical manifestation of Bhagavadgeeta, the characters in Mahabharata represent many facets of the Dharma Shaastra in Bhagavadgeeta
