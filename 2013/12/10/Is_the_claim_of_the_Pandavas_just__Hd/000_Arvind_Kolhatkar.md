Dear Friends,

  

The question described below bothers me a lot. I would like to be advised by a leaned member of this Group whether this question has been posed before, and, if so, what answer has been given.

  

We have been brought up with the belief that in the Mahabharata story, the Pandavas were on the side of justice and the Kauravas were the villains, denying to the Pandavas their just due. This injustice led to the Great War and we have been brought up on that story. Is it possible that the story as it appears to us was written by the victors, who have succeeded in demonizing and demeaning the defeated side?

  

As far as can be seen, in ancient India the rule of succession of kingship was that of primogeniture, that is, the crown passed from the father to the eldest son. The earlier successions in the dynasty of Bharatas followed this principle and so did successions in other dynasties like that of Raghu, or more historically, the Mauryas, the Nandas and the Guptas. 

  

Following primogeniture, Vichitravirya succeeded Shantanu - Bhishma having renounced his claim - and Dhritarashtra succeeded Vichitravirya.
He was blind from birth but that has not been and cannot be held against him. His younger brother, Pandu, helped him run the kingdom for some years but later renounced that life and retired to the forest. By the same rule of primogeniture, Duryodhana was the rightful successor to the whole kingdom. Where arises the right of the Pandava brothers to claim the kingdom or even a part of it for themselves? We do not know of any other case where a kingdom was divided between two brothers because it is not the old king's private property. Then how do we justify Pandavas taking recourse to arms to wrest it from the Kauravas?
Also how do they justify the claim when King Dhritarashtra is alive and well? Such behavior is called treachery and the perpetrator deserves the Traitor's Death. (In medieval England this was particularly gruesome, involving 'hanging, drawing and quartering'. The traitor was hanged, then cut down while still alive, his entrails were excised out of his body and burned before his eyes and then he was cut in four pieces and those pieces were strung up on the town gates. But that is just an aside...)

  

It has not been the case that the rule of Dhritarashtra was unjust to the subjects and lacking in Dharma. No such case has been made out. If that had been the case there was the precedent of King Vena being pulled down from his throne. That precedent does not apply here. There is no mention of any discontent among the subjects or their participation in the war, which seems to have been purely a fight between kings and their soldiery on the rival sides.

  

It is noteworthy that all learned men in Dhritarastra's court stayed loyal to him till death. Bhishma and Kripa fought on the Kaurava side and perished in the war. It is also noteworthy that more kings had sided with Kauravas than Pandavas.

  

On this background I find in perplexing that everyone, starting from Vyasa himself and Krishna, is on the Pandava side and only villains like Shakuni and Jayadratha back Kauravas.

  

There are narrations of several injustices perpetrated by Kauravas against the Pandavas. There is also the fact that Kauravas have names like Duryodhana and Duhshasana, which, though not bad names in themselves when translated literally, still start with inauspicious particle 'Duh'. Now which father would willingly select such inauspicious-sounding names for his sons? Such stories and names could well be the result of the writing of History by the victors to suit themselves. It is well-said that History is written by the victors!

  

On this background, I am perplexed by the total silence in the last 2500 years to mention or comment upon what looks like a patently undeserved claim of the Pandavas. The pendulum, on the other hand, has swung to the other side and everyone in only full of praise for the Pandavas.
Why is that so?
