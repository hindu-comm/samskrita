Ananad ji, Even though that appears to be the primary reason. Mahabharata was destined to happen. Hence that episode merely acted as a pretext for the war. The primary purpose Sri. Krishna's avatara was for the purpose of destruction of rakshasas who by that time had taken various forms who joined forces with Duryodhana. Some even assumed the forms of yadavas. Hence if your remember Sri Krishna gives away some of his own army to Duryodhana. The only way the destruction of these millions of rakshasas is possible easily if they were somehow made to go to war against the righteous. Hence the war.

Regards,  
Venu
