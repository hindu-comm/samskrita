Dear Mr. Murthy ,  
  

The discussion is now going into history , and prehistory and I do not know how much it concerns the subject matter of the egroup. The moderator will be justified if he does not allow my email through .  

  

Quote  

For all I know, Vyasa could himself be a fictional character. It is highly improbable that one person wrote all the Puranas and the Mahabharata, especially when methods of writing were very crude.

 Unquote  
  

Could be . But the continuity and nonambiguity that is exhibited in these books is unparalleled .  
  

I will give an example . P G Wodehouse wrote some 90 books in his lifetime . There are inconsistencies in his descriptions . For example was Aunt Dahlia a maternal aunt or paternal aunt of Wooster is not clear . This kind of inconsistencies do not exist in any of the above books.

So many places , and so many things which can be correlated and still cannot prove anything ? Beats me .  
  

Secondly only time you see eight constellations in the sky is when you are high above in the sky - at about 2 kms height . This corresponds correctly to description of vimanas in the Ramayana period .

The planetary events are neither backwards or forwards . Given our software we can go thousands of years in the future or thousands of years in the past . The movements are constant or change as per precession which can be mathematically determined . You can see the ephemeris given by NASA or the swiss ephemeris . What we cannot see are the sudden events that may change a number of things . For example an unknown comet colliding with some planet . But that leaves the solar system by and large constant and intact . For example how do we know that the star we call as pole star keeps changing every 27000 years or so . If you need further clarification please send me personal mail . I will be happy to respond . 

  

Regards ,
