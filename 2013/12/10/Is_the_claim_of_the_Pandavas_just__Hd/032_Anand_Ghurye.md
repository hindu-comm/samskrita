Dear Mr. Kolhatkar ,  
  
  

Let us take for the argument sake that the concept of Rashis was not existent at the time of Ramayana ( as per Mr. Dixit ) , then one more conclusion can be drawn from it can be Ramayana belongs to sometime in the pre Rashi period . When would that place it ?  
  

Mr. Dixit's work is definitely authoritative but not necessarily definitively authoritative .  
  

One Dr. Bhave , a medical doctor and an avid pilot , has surveyed the route described in Ramayana aerially and has written a detailed book on the logistics , the journey and the timings which closely match those given in Ramayana . Interestingly he has also mentioned that several locations as depicted in the epic may be recognised as such only from aerial survey . Seen from the ground , these do not make any sense .  

  

Some of parts of the epic may be exaggerated , but we need not deny the essence . A lot of research needs to go into it . By the way as per some researchers , Sanskrit itself is an artificial code language designed to ensure a particular group's dominance on the rest . That does not take away the beauty, strength and utility of the language .  
  
  

  
  

  

  
  
  
Regards ,
