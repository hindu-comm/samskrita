अनन्तशास्त्रं बहुवेदितव्यं  
 अल्पश्च कालो बहवश्च विघ्नाः ॥

 हंसो यथा क्षीरमिवाम्बुमिश्रम् ॥  
Endless are the scriptures to be studied.  
 Brief is the life-span, numerous are the hurdles.  
The essence it is that needs to be practised  
 Like the swan separating the milk mixed with water.  
           uttara gItA 3:1
उत्तर गीता ३:१  
Nowhere would this this be more apt than the study of Mahabharata.  
Scholars who have spent their life-time extracring the essence are still working at it.  
Mahabharata - A Criticism (1905) by C.A.Vaidya; and  
Prologomena to the Critical Edition of Mahabharata (1942) by  
    V.S.Sukthankar, the master architect of the Critical 
    Edition (BORI), need to be studied first even before 
   we start quoting the "Mahabharata".  
Both are available online for download.
