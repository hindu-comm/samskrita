\<Even though Dhritarashtra was elder, he was advised / pressured / told by the advisors to hand over the rule to Pandu. Similarly, with the Pandavas and KAuravas under the gurus, upon seeing the righteousness of the pandavas, Drona and Bhishma advise Dhritarashtra to give the rule to them.>

  

True, DhritaraShTra was asked to yield to Pandu because of his physical defect, which he did. Later, Pandu gave up the throne and proceeded into Vanaprastha. At that time, he had no child. When he did get his own children - in the Niyoga sense -, he was not a king. How could he pass on anything to his children that he himself did not possess?  
  

\<Dhritarashtra was asked to give up his rule due to a physical shortcoming, and he was asked to give up his eldest son's right due to a moral/ behavioural shortcoming...>  

  

Dhritarashtra, despite his physical disability, was allowed to resume kingship by the same elders after Pandu retired. Kingship thus came back to him which could, under primogeniture, could only pass to his eldest son. I think I have already said that the perceived wickedness of Duryodhana et al could just be interested propaganda. The only side that has come down to us is the Victors' side.

  

\<I read that the names were suyodhana, which means great warrior and duryodhana means the one who is difficult to fight and win against. We have this popular perception of using "Dur" for anything bad.. and hence we give it a negative spin....>  

  

Adhyaya 116 of Adiparva gives the names of all sons of DhritaraShTra.
The given name of the eldest was Duryodhana and not Suyodhana. Only Dharmaraj, because he was such a good man at heart, used to call him Suyodhana. The name Durydhana is a good name by literal meaning but again, as I asked, which parent would choose it for his son? Hence my suspicion of the Victor's spin.

  

In the end, let me state my position again. At this stage, it makes little difference whether Pandavas were in the right or not. My only query is, how in the last 2500 years, this question about the legitimacy of the Pandava claim did not occur to anyone out if the hundreds of learned commentators of Mahabharata? This is a very basic and straight-forward query and should be capable of being demolished with ease, if it is so utterly silly.
