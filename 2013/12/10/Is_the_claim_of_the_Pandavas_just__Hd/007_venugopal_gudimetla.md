Prabha ji,  
Namaskar, Some questions and observations:  
1. Did Pandu abdicate his kingdom and make Dhritarashtra the king before he went to Vanavasa? he didn't.  
2. You forgot that Kunti's eldest son is Karna actually...the eldest of all.  
3. If you want to consider only the known sons of Kunti, even then Duryodhana wasn't the eldest, it was Dharma raja. Ghandhari becomes impatient after a prolonged pregnancy and after she comes to know that Kunti ha given birth to Dharma raja.  
  
Being eldest is not the only rule.  
  
Regards,  
Venu
