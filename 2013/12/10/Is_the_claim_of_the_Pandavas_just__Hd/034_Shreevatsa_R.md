Whether the Mahabharata is a fictional story or not, it still makes sense to ask the original question "Is the claim of the Pandavas just?".  

  

Even if the Mahabharata is a story, it is a story set in a particular universe, with aparticularsequence of events, aparticularset of principles (the dharma-śāstras,etc.),and aparticular(for the most part)internally consistent logic to things. So it makes sense to ask questions like "Is the Pandavas' claim valid?", "Why did Bhīṣma do this or that?", etc., and expect "in-universe" answers, the same way one can ask such questions about novels or movies. (For example, see some questions and answers at <http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/harry-potter> which are all about Harry Potter, which is clearly acknowledged as fictional.) Of course, there can always be out-of-universe glib answers like "the poet wrote it that way to make the story more interesting", or "the actor did it that way because the director told him to do so", but if we care about the story, we must first attempt to seek in-universe answers.

  

From this point of view, answers in this thread like

\- Anand Ghuye's quoting ofSabha parva book 2 Chapter 67 (which mentions the agreement before the dice-game of returning the kingdom after the 13th year if conditions are met),

\- Sunder Hattangadi's quoting ofAdi Parva, Viduragamana parva, Ch. 208(Ganguly)/198(BORI)/225(Southern) (which mentions Dhṛtarāṣṭra acknowledging the Pāṇḍavas' entitlement to the kingdom),

are the kinds of answers that may be expected.

  

Now for my own non-answer. There are, as I see it, two separate questions:

  

\(1\) Just before the war, did the Pāṇdavas have a valid claim? This seems to have been answered, with a clear yes: before the dice game, they already had a kingdom (Indraprastha) that had been given to them by the king Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and of which they were the undisputed rulers (at least "officially", though some specific people without a say in it, like Duryodhana, might have disagreed). (These will need some sources to substantiate.) The conditions of the dice game were that they would be returned it, an agreement which was not upheld.

  

\(2\) Did they have a valid claim to Indraprastha itself? It appears that Duryodhana did not acknowledge so. Answering this question would require some sources both from the Mahabhārata, and from the Dharmaśāstras (whether or not a king is indeed allowed to divide his kingdom thus). Our personal modern-day morals ("of course he can" or "of course he can't; it's not his private property") have no bearing on this matter.
