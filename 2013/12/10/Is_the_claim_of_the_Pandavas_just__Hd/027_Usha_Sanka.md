vyAsa= kRShna dvaipAyana, Suka's father, parASara's son, vaSiShTha's great grandson, Sakti's grandson, vibhAjaka of vedas (by which he derives the name- vedavyAsa), writer of mahAbhArta, purANas,

*मुनीनाम्* अप्यहम्*व्यासः-* so declares SrIkRShna in gItA..**

... Can such a person ONLY be a mere kavi?
