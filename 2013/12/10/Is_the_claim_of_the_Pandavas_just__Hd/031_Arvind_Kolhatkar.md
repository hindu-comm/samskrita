Dear Group,

  

I had a look at the blog mentioned by Usha Sanka. I have several doubts about its contents but here I will restrict myself to one of them.

  

The blog mentions that the positions of stars at the time of the birth of Rama has been noted in Ramayana and if the date, as per the current calendar, of those positions is calculated by by using modern software, it turns out to be January 10, 5114 BC. (One really does not need modern software for these calculations. They can be done, with some patience, with pencil and paper too. The modern software only removes the 'grunt factor' of these calculations!)

  

I had a look at verse 1.18.9 of Ramayana as available at<http://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/baala/sarga18/bala_18_frame.htm>.
It reads

  

ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पता इंदुना सह \|\| १-१८-९ (This suffers from bad grammar but I do not have a better Devanagari version).  

  

The meaning is the planets Jupiter and Moon were in the Rashi of Cancer.

  

My problem with such calculation is the fact that according to experts the concept of Rashis was absent around the year 5114 BC. I consulted Shankar Balkrishna Dixit's authoritative Marathi book
भारतीयज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास (1896). After discussing the state of knowledge of Astronomy at the time of Vedang Jyotishas and Mahabharata he has made the following observations on pp 97 and 113 in the Marathi book.  Dixit's Marathi book has been translated into English by RV Vaidya under the auspices of the Meteorological Department of the Government of India and is digitally available at[www.scribd.com/doc/76777633/Bharatiya-](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76777633/Bharatiya-)**Jyotish**-Sastra-1‎ and[www.scribd.com/doc/76935732/Bharatiya-](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76935732/Bharatiya-)**Jyotish**-Sastra-2‎

‎Vaidya's Vtranslation of these two passages is as under:

  

\<Mesha and other signs.

  

It does not mention any Rashis (signs) nor was the system of stating a planet's place with respect to 12 divisions of the ecliptic. The position of the sun and the moon are given with respect to the nakshatras.

(p.96. Vaidya translation)

  

Nowhere in the Mahabharata is found a single reference to Yoga, Karana, or Rashi. Had Rashis been in vogue at any stage of Mahabharata's compilation, they would certainly have come into the text. This definitely shows that the terms Aries (Mesha), Tauraus (Vrishabha) etc. were not current in the age when the Mahabharata was compiled. In the same way it was not the system to mention a planet's position with reference to a part after dividing the ecliptic into 12 parts.
Everywhere in the Mahabharata we find the position of the moon and other planets with reference to stars.

(p. 147 Vaidya translation.)>

  

If the concept of Rashis itself did not exist in the year 5114 BC, how could anyone have noted by observation that Jupiter and Moon were in the the rashi of Karkata (Cancer)?

  

Secondly, if Indians of 5114 BC had such knowledge of Astronomy, where did it disappear for the next 3,500 years without leaving a single trace of its existence and only re-emerge at the time of the compilation Vedanga Jyotisha and Mahabhaarata/Ramayana?

  

The way to explain this is to question the contemporaneousness of these astronomical observations. In all probability they were inserted into Ramayana by an interpolator. The interpolator either had sufficient knowledge of Astronomy to lay down a combination of astronomical observation to suit his belief that Ram was a very ancient personality or he picked up this a combination out of his imagination. (It is known that due to the constant movement of heavenly bodies, for any randomly laid down combination, it is to possible to find a time of its having come about at some time in the past.)

  

(I believe with Murthy that both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana are vastly elaborated and embroidered versions of much simpler events that took place on a far smaller scales and that bards built over them for centuries to give them their present epic forms. I know that this view will be totally unacceptable to many.)
