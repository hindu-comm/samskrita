In Adi Parva, Ch. 208, Viduragamana parva , Dhritarashtra himself proclaims the right of Pandavas for a share of the kingdom  
  
SECTION CCVIII  
(Viduragamana Parva continued)  
"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these various speeches, Dhritarashtra said, The learned Bhishma, the son  
of Santanu, and the illustrious Rishi Drona, and thyself also (O Vidura), have said the truth and what  
also is most beneficial to me. Indeed, as those mighty car-warriors, the heroic sons of Kunti. are the  
children of Pandu, so are they, without doubt, my children according to the ordinance. And as my sons  
are entitled to this kingdom, so are the sons of Pandu certainly entitled to it. Therefore, hasten to bring  
hither the Pandavas along with their mother, treating them with affectionate consideration. O thou of  
Bharata's race, bring also Krishna of celestial beauty along with them. From sheer good fortune the sons  
of Pritha are alive; and from good fortune alone those mighty car-warriors have obtained the daughter of  
Drupada. It is from good fortune alone that our strength hath increased, and it is from good fortune alone  
that Purochana hath perished. O thou of great splendour, it is from good fortune that my great grief hath  
been killed!'
