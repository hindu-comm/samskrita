Bhasa discusses this in Dutavkyam through a lively dialogue between Krishna and perhaps Duryodhana.( I do not have the text readily) and I am tempted to quote this verse from memory:

विचित्रवीर्यो विषयी विपत्तिं क्षयेण यातः पुनरम्बिकायाम् ।

व्यासेन जातः धृतराष्ट्र एषः लभेत राज्यं जनकः कथं ते ॥

Regards
