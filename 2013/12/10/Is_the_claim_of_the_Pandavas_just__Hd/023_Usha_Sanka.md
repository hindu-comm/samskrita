Namaste

नियोगव्यवस्था was apt for dvApara yuga- so declares मनुस्मृतिः। It is not good for कलियुग because people are विषयलोल and lack इन्द्रियनिग्रह. Hence vyAsa who is satyvati's son is legitimately eligible in giving children to his half brother's wives.

  

Bhasa, (for that matter any drAma writer,) is no smRtikAra or RShi or atleast even a sAdhaka. He is a kavi. So kavi's words are to be taken as kavi's, and not as a dhArmic head's. He did not write any dhArmic granthas that we can take as pramANam. It is his mere "opinion" or "look" at that issue. Poetry divorced from nIti long back. So please do not confuse poetry issues with dhArmic issues. They need separate light to study, like a Cellular bilology, Nuclear Science. Not just anybody can talk of it.  

  

युगधर्म and contextual rules and regulations are very important and should be taken into consideration while talking of epics. Close scrutiny at mahAbhArata reveals that- side that won was that which was on side of dharma. And the most soothing thing is all rules are mentioned in smRti granthas, and are followed in tact. And the decisions were made after consulting elders and learned people of that time.., not casually or "conveniently" manipulated by half-learned.

This thinking of parentage question arises when we look at issues from kaliyuga dharma point of view.
