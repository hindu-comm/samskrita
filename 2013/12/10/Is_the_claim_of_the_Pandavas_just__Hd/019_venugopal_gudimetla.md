\>\>The ordained king of Hastinapur was Pandu, and not Dritharashtra. Pandu ruled it, but was childless. He was infertile. But his elder brother had children. So, rule is that the Suyo/Duryo-dhana becomes the rightful heir after Pandu's death. Dritharashtra was happy at that.  

----  
Pandu was cursed by a rishi that if he ever tries to enter into a sexual congress with his wife, he would die, this is for killing him and his wife while they were engaged in kaama kreeda in the form of two deers. This is not because he was infertile. Secondly when Dharma Raja was born, Gandhari was still pregnant, she infact breaks her womb into 100 pieces hence the Kaurava princes are 100. She does so after hearing the news that Kunti has given birth to Yudhistira and she becomes impatient with the prolonged pregnancy.

  
\>\> I feel Bheeshma, the most revered one, was most opportunistic parasite. The whole battle can be attributed to his selfish interest to enjoy the power without owning the accompanying responsibilities. He could have accepted the request for marriage to right a wrong befallen on the woman (Amba). He chose to back out.  
He could have accepted the right to rule after Vichitraveerya died (Satyavathi in fact requested, he did not). He shied away from that. His oath had only a simple purpose. it was only to get his father's desire for marriage fulfilled. That purpose was well over.

The choice to accept responsibilities of life came much after his vow and much after they were relevant any more. He could have assumed them since they were larger responsibilities which could have saved the tribe of a major and unnecessary war, but he chose to take the easy way that he was used to all his life.

He could have prevailed upon DR to see justice ad fairness in the demand to hand over the kingdom to Yudhishtir, but he continued to look the other side of his responsibility. I sometimes felt that his irresponsibility was the key reason for the war.  

----  
Interesting, Why do you think Bheeshma was opportunistic? What opportunism did you see in his renunciation of the throne for his father's progeny? What opportunism and parasitic behaviour did you see in him being in the camp of Kauravas even though he was insulted by Duryodhana, Karna and such at every given opportunity? What parasitic behaviour did you observe in Bheeshma's oath of not marrying at all?  
After taking an oath, it is dharmic duty to keep the promise made, which Bheeshma did till the end. Bheeshma wa bound by dharma to keep the promise come what may, hence the oath he made is called Bheeshma pratingya. Assume responsibilities and assume the throne doesnt even arise, given that he was bound by the promise he made to stay loyal to the throne and never ascend it.

Bheeshma who was able to defeat Parashurama, who made Sri Krishna fear for the protection of Pandavas in the war, you think he shied away from responsibilities? If he so wanted he could have been the king when none of his step brothers Were blessed with sons. What stopped him wasnt his fear nor that he give up his responsibilities, but his dharma nista.

Duryodhana, since as a kid never liked Pandavas, he tried to kill Bheema not once but several times. His hate and jealousy for the Pandavas made him ignore every advice he was given. He was also advised by Bheeshma to give 5 villages if not more to Pandavas. He implored Duryodhana but fell of deaf years. Sri Krishna explains to Arjuna in the Geeta that the war was unavoidable, as Arjuna was a mere agent, Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Karna, Duryodhana were destined to die even if Arjuna doesn't want to fight the war. Which means that the MB war destined to happen. In fact the very reason and purpose of Sri Krishna's avatara was that among others. So not Bheeshama, not anyone could have prevented the war. It was destined to happen right from the start.
