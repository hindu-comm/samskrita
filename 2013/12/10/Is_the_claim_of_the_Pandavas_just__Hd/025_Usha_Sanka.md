Namaste  

devApi was SAntanu's elder brother. He had gone away to tapovanam right in his childhood. When it was time for throne (after pratIpas' death), he was made to return back and accept kingship. But he had adhArmic life at forest with impious people, which was revealed later. So he was dethroned.

pANDu has not one quality similar to devApi. Why should he be disqualified?
