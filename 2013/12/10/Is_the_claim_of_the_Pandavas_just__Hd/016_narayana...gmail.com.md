Dear Members: Discussion on MB is a measure of the vibrancy of Hindu culture. let us not avoid it even if we may not know all the history. Here is my two paise worth of discussion. MB is not the history of the victors, even if Krishna oriented interpolations might have taken place.

  

I wonder why "succession issue" is relevant for MB? From MB text it is known that Dhrtaraashtra died 18 years after the war in a forest fire. The legal question of succession was not the cause of the war and the so called claims. While we do not know the whole political situation at that time, there were kinglings, kings and chief-kings. Dhr. was the Maharaja (De jure). Others in his kingdom were perhaps like chiefs,dalavoys, samantas, knights, courtiers etc. KarNa was called Anga-Raja but MB does not describe him ruling at the Anga-capital, but shown more as a friend and courtier of Duryodhana (De facto chief of Kurus). It is the jealousy between the cousins which was the basic reason for the story. Dharmaraja would have been happy as a courtier with some rank at Hastinapura. But it was the scheming of a few Kauravas which forced them out to VaraNavata etc. So when they returned with a wife, Dhrta, rightly wanted to rehabilitate them and gave them KhaanDava which was a forest. They developed a small kingdom but still under the Hastinapura jurisdiction. Even though under the advice of Krishna they consolidated their territory & did Rajasuya (not Ashvamedha, which happened only after the war) MB does not say that they fought against Hastinapura. Like in Europe a warrior could not refuse to fight when challenged, during MB time kings could not refuse to gamble! \[Even some 1000 years back it is said scholars challenged for a debate could not refuse. The defeated usually were thrown out of their country\]. To cut the story short, it is the false sense of honour which led Pandavas to lose their share ( not the main throne which they never claimed). When Krishna was asked why he did not prevent the game, his explanation was that he learnt about it too late as he was fighting against kings from the western islands \[Possibly the island kings in the present day dried up Rann-of-kutch region\].

My conclusion: Pandavas never claimed the throne at Hastinapura. It was jealousy and jealousy to which Shakuni added his share of evil designs.

  

I am writing from memory but can produce the originals to the above effect if required. But this will take a long time as I am away from Bangalore without access to the sources.
