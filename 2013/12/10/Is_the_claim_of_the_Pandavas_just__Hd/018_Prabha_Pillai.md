The ordained king of Hastinapur was Pandu, and not Dritharashtra. Pandu ruled it, but was childless. He was infertile. But his elder brother had children. So, rule is that the Suyo/Duryo-dhana becomes the rightful heir after Pandu's death. Dritharashtra was happy at that.

  

But Pandu thinked otherwise. Whilst he was still in his prime, he decides to recede to a forest for making obeisance to gods and for treatment to beget children. He hands over the charge of the Kingdom (does not relinquish) to his elder brother, DR.

  

So DR was a custodian of the Kingdom till his younger brother returns. He is not the King. He cannot also lay claim "LEGITIMATELY" to the kingdom nor can he insist that his son be coronated as the next king, if Pandu or his children return.

  

Which is exactly what happened. Kunti returned with her children after Pandu's death. The five that returned were Pandu's children, whether he was their biological father or not. Even if they were adopted, the right could not have been questioned.

  

I feel Bheeshma, the most revered one, was most opportunistic parasite. The whole battle can be attributed to his selfish interest to enjoy the power without owning the accompanying responsibilities. He could have accepted the request for marriage to right a wrong befallen on the woman (Amba). He chose to back out.

  

He could have accepted the right to rule after Vichitraveerya died (Satyavathi in fact requested, he did not). He shied away from that. His oath had only a simple purpose. it was only to get his father's desire for marriage fulfilled. That purpose was well over.

  

The choice to accept responsibilities of life came much after his vow and much after they were relevant any more. He could have assumed them since they were larger responsibilities which could have saved the tribe of a major and unnecessary war, but he chose to take the easy way that he was used to all his life.

  

He could have prevailed upon DR to see justice ad fairness in the demand to hand over the kingdom to Yudhishtir, but he continued to look the other side of his responsibility. I sometimes felt that his irresponsibility was the key reason for the war.

  

Whatever be the propriety of refusing DR the right to rule coz he was blind, the right of Yudhisthira cannot be wished away at all.

  

But the funny aspect is Mahabharata is a story that proves that there is no dharma that cannot be termed as adaharma and there is no adharma which cannot be termed as dharma. All it requires is a Machiavellian character like Krishna to do either!!! :)

  

  

So, the conflict starts. The Mahabharatha war is never ending :)
