Anunad Ji,

  

I am aware of this process as such. But it becomes a cost prohibitive exercise when i am asked to get my entire book list re-validated by a proof reader/editor after the batch conversion. You can imagine the cost of having a good quality editor going through say even a 100 books of 100 pages each.

  

This is why i am looking for an otf font which can be used in EPUB3 embedding, which can read exactly like my non-unicode font. I will attach the list for your use, and you can perhaps suggest something more? ( I might have been wrong to say legacy, these are type 1 fonts)
