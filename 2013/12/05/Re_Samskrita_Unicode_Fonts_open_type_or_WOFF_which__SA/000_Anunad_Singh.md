Kiran Gupta ji,  
  

You forgot to attach the list of fonts, but I think it is not required. I have been associated with development of font converters and can say that 100% accuare font converter can be designed if required. Some errors are visible after conversion to Unicode and they are mostly related to 'wrong typing'. By this I mean legacy fonts give some amount of liberty in typing. Even these typing errors can also be corrected along with font conversion.  
  

I do not see any other option for your problem. A font converter can be desinged in a day or two which can convert thousands of files in batch mode without any manual intervention.  
  

May be a free font converter is already vailable for you. It may need a bit of fine-tuning if you are very particular about accuracy. Also, the unicode file so obtained may be passed through a good spell checker and thus the text made more accurate than the original.

जब भी देश पर विपत्ति, जुल्म, गुलामी की मुसीबत आई है।  
अपनी यह हिंदी ही काम आई है।  
रामानंद और रामानुजाचार्य से लेकर  
अन्ना तक सबने हिंदी ही अपनाई है।
