Anunad Ji,

  

Your 3rd point hits quite close to the mark. It is a standard practice with all writers that we use different fonts within our text to show headings, footnotes, references etc. The same is true for almost all books. They all contain a mixture of these fonts in some capacity or the other.

  

Which is why i am trying to just change the font itself. I will not even touch the text file, but just change the pointer/link for the fonts. The html doc (inside the EPUB) will automatically refer to the relevant otf font.

  

This is why i'm looking for someone who can help me design otf fonts which have the same character sets as the post script fonts.

  

Regards,
