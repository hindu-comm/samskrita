Karan ji,  
  

I think that a font converter can be designed which can give you almost 100% correct results and then you do not need proof reading. The correctness need not be seen word by word, or page by page but it will be evident by randomly seeing even 10 pages.  
  

But here are some problems with solution:  
  

\(1\) I was thinking of converting text files. So formatting etc has to be redone.  
  

\(2\) If the text contains English mixed with Hindi, all English words will be converted to some rubbish-looking words in Devanagari.  
  

\(3\) You have listed so many fonts. If your files have mixed fonts (a single file has Krutidev, Chanakya and some other fonts in it) it will add to difficulty.  
  

  

It is possible to keep formatting undisturbed while changing the font, for which a font converter macro for MS Word or Pagemaker (I do not know whether it allows to use macros) has to be designed. But this process (font conversion using macro in MS word) is slow. Also it may not allow batch conversion.
