Hi,

  

I am a publisher, and i am facing some difficulties related to legacy fonts in hindi.

  

All new EPUBs (Standard format for EBOOKS) require the fonts to be either of open type or WOFF which is not the case for most Indian legacy fonts (list attached below). 

  

Since all backlisted content with Indian publishers is in these non-unicode format, it cannot be converted to the digital files. Generally font conversion can be done, but it leaves errors which are very difficult to identify.

  

I would like to ask for help in development/link of unicode fonts which can be used to read the legacy fonts by just replacing the font file in html documents (In my opinion if the font definition is identical then the errors would not come in).

  

Please let me know if anyone can offer some advice in this regard.

  

Thanks,

  

Karan
