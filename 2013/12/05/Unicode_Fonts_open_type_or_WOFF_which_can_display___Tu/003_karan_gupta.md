Hi Taff,

  

I guess i was not able to explain it properly. I'm trying to understand how to convert my Hindi language books (currently pagemaker/indesign files with fonts) into EPUBs.

  

Now i can either convert the whole thing to unicode using some converters, for which i'll have to start a fresh cycle of detailed proof reading (because they will always have errors)

  

OR

  

I can embedd the fonts in the EPUB so that the system picks them up by default. But under the EPUB 3 guidelines they will only support open type fonts or WOFF. So in this case i need the open type font which can be used to read my .pfb font based content.

  

I am attaching the font list, and i think i might have been wrong when i said legacy. I read a little more and these are type 1 fonts, but my problem remains the same.

  

|                  |                | |------------------|----------------| | FONTS            | FONT TYPE      | | KrutiDev         | ttf (no issue) | | Walkman Chanakya | pfb            | | Chanakya         | pfb            | | Shiva            | pfb            | | Shiva medium     | pfb            | | Akbar            | pfb            | | Amatya           | pfb            | | Madhvi           | pfb            | | Pervina          | pfb            | | Subak            | ttf            | | Abhushan         | pfb            | | Priya            | pfb            | | SG               | pfb            | | Kundli           | ttf            | | AAAman           | pfb            |



  

This problem is currently being faced by all Indian language publishers, for all their books which were published before Hindi Unicode came in. If such fonts can become available then the entire content in Hindi will be easily accessible in the EPUB format.
