नमस्ते



**Disclaimer**- I am not related to Anki and do not work for profit and do not gain any monetary benefits from any of the work mentioned in this mail.



**Humble request** - people who do not have interest or time to memorize ashtadhyayi, please ignore this conversation.



The easiest thing in the world is to start a new project, any one can do it and most of us do all the time. The hardest thing is to finish the project that was undertaken.



The project I undertook was to memorize ashtadhyayi, I experimented with many tools and learning methods to memorize this revered text. In the process, I broke the audio into 20 sutra sets, created PowerPoint presentations, paper flashcards, played single trackin a loop until I memorizedit, etc etc. I finally settled for 10 new sutras a day and so far its working good. set realistic pace and goal that you can keep doing for a year or two.



I managed to create the Anki Deck for learning Ashtadhyayi. You can view, read the summary and download from the link below.  
<https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2069907638>

The deck size is large **160MB** because of audio files. The deck info gives full credit to the person who created the audio and made it available for free.  

I am also attaching excel spreadsheet that I use, to monitor my progress. There is a blue divider column. Do not delete the numbers on the left side of this column. Delete the sutra number from the chapter that you already memorized on the right side and it will show you yourprogress.

You are free to modify the spreadsheet to your liking.



Happy learning

There are no contradictions, ifyou see one then check your premises. 



If you like the work and benefit from it do not forget to donate money to Sanskrit Bharati and Anki.

I know nothing beats free but things do not appear out of thin air, material, time and efforts are involved and itmust be rewarded.
