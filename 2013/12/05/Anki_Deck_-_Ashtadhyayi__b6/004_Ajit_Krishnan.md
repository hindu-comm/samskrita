This is a relatively common problem with google chrome (i.e. through word of mouth, several people are experiencing the same problem when trying to view emails in gmail with devanagari unicode content). The problem seems to come and go.

  

When the problem occurs, try another browser ... IE, Firefox, etc.

  

sasneham,
