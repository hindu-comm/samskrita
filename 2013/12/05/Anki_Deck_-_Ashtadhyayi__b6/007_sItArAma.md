Namaste Vishvas

Yes many smaller decks can be created but as par ankithat's not efficient way toorganize the database. They say creating one large file is good and within that people can create smaller decks under custom study optionswith tag names. Let me know if that works for you, I have not explored that option because my goal is to memorize entire aShTAdhyAyI

Else send me the sutra sets from and to for each smaller group you want to createand I will publish smaller sets as well.

Regards
