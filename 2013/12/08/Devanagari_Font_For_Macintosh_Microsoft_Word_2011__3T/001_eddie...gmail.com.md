### Lionel,

  

I quote:

  

" Best of all, OpenType is a truly cross-platform format. ***You can use the same font on Mac or Windows machines without converting the font or fearing that reflow***. Everywhere you use an OpenType font, it is the same typeface, same kerning, same line breaks."

  

  

Here be foundsome light upon the darkness:
