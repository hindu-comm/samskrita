The most convenient way I found to type error-free samskrit (or any other Indian language) is to use Pramukh IME software (free) on Windows.  
<http://www.vishalon.net/PramukhIME/Windows.aspx>  
  

It uses a proper transliteration scheme unlike Google transliterator which tries to guess the word you want to type, and mostly gets it wrong (for me).  

The keyboard shortcuts are also nicely displayed along with the tool. You can use it with any application running on Windows.  

\- Sai.
