Conversation about input came up couple of times, for Linux and Mac users its easy to activate inbuilt INSCRIPT keyboard layout.

Select Devanagari / hindi or anyother regional language and you are good to go.



I like this because there is no need to type "a" after every consonant. "k" = "क" and you need to type "f" for halanta sign. personally I feel I can type faster this way than any IME methods, google IME's constant guessing makes typing really hard and results in many typos in documents.
