Many thanks, Sai Susarlaji.

I downloaded Pramukh. For some reason my Windows (Word 2007) chooses Mangal font automatically and I need to change it to Aerial Unicode MS for getting devanagari script. With Mangal font, I get rectangular blocks only. How do I make my system to choose Aerial Unicode MS automatically (by default) when I invoke Pramukh?

Regards

Murthy
