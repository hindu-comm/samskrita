There has been a lot of discussion about Samskritam for children, books for children ... I am happy to announce that a new book has been published. As the author, and somebody very interested in children's education, I would like this book to reach as many people as possible.
All revenue generated goes back to children's book publication.

  

Please see the announcement below. We would like to request and encourage your passing on this message to your friends and family, and organizations that you are associated with. Please buy the book for your own children. (The book is currently available only through the US bookstore of Samskrita Bharati. Those interested in having this title in India, please let me know, and we will see what we could do.).  

  

Please see the attached flier. Bookstore search for 'bhekaraja' will locate the book.  The[link to the book](http://bookstore.samskritabharatiusa.org/books/index.php/products-a-z/for-children/bhekaraja-ma-uka2013-09-23-03-59-241476473985-detail)in the online bookstore is repeated below.
