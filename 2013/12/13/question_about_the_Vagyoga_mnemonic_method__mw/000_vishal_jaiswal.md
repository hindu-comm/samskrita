Namaste, has anyone had any experience or knowhow about learning  
Sanskrit by this method?  
There is a bit of information at these two links, but there are no details.

There is also a youtube link in one of the links above - if an  
experienced Sanskrit scholar from this list can shed some critical light  
on this method, it would be nice.  
I was considering getting their book, but since there are no online  
reviews or etc about this method, I thought of asking here.  
  
The teacher will be in Bombay for some days, and I was trying to decide  
whether going for some classes would be useful.
