John,

  

Yes, its called Itranslator 2003 (:-).

  

It runs in *Desktop* mode.

  

Under Windows 8.1 Pro, on my Desktop PC, Itranslator 2003 runs just fine, (as does Itranslator beta with its Reverse Conversion from Devanagari to Transliteration/ITRANS).

  

However itdoesn't show up on the Metro Apps Interface.
