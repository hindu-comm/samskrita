Hi All,

  

I have just finished my first year of Sanskrit at the Australian National University (ANU).

  

I am thinking of 'downsizing' from a laptop to MS Surface Pro 2 tablet running Windows 8.1. On my laptop I currently use Itranslator 2003 to do my Sanskrit assignments and then copy and paste the answer into Word. Is there an app which will run under Windows 8.1 which is similar to Itranslator 2003?

  

Many thanks,

  

John
