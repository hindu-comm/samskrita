Namaste to everyone

  

Recently while going through the namas of Sri Subrahmanya I found one namah. And I would like to know whether my understanding is correct or not?

  

the nama is

  

ॐ वचढ्भुवे नमः  

  

om vachadhbhuve namah

  

The meanin for that in tamil isசொல்லில் இருந்து வெளிபடுபவர்.

rough translation on english is "who manifest out of para vAk"

  

Please do let me know whether the meaning is right or not.

  

Thanks in advance

  

C.R.Bala

Sri Sacchidananda Shiva Abhinava Sri Nrsimha Bharti Thirtha Charanaaravindhabhyaam namah

Sri Chandrasekhara saraswathi mahaswami Charanaaravindhabhyaam namah

Sri Chandrasekhara bharati thirtha Charanaaravindhabhyaam namah
