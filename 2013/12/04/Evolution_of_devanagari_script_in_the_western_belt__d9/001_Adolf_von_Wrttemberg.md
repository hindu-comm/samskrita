Shrii Patel,

Thank you for posting this interesting देवनागरी script source! In the book, ‘The World’s Writing Systems’, the authors discuss how these early scripts eventually became not only the source of South Indian scripts but also those of Burma (Myanmar) and Vietnam.

Again: अहम् अनुगृहीतोऽस्मि ॥
