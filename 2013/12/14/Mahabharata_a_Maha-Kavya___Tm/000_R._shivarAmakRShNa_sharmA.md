Namaste,

  

It is well known that Ramayana or Adi-Kavya exhibits all traits of a Maha-Kavya as enumerated in works like Sahityadarpana.

  

Mahabharata being the only other Itihasa I can think of, can Mahabharata also be classified as a Mahakavya ? For starters it has more than 8 vibhagas (sarga?), and it definitely enumerates the story of a Kshatriya dynasty, it also starts with a Mangala-shloka. As to whether it fulfills all rules to be classified as a Maha-Kavya, I pray the learned members of this group to illuminate me on this.

  

N.B. The classification of Shivarahasya as Itihasa is not universally accepted. Besides Dayananda Sarasvati of Arya Samaj fame does not consider these works as 'Arsha'. According to him Purana, and Narashamsi are contained within the Samhita/Brahmana portions and the 18 puranas and the various other upa-puranas along with Mahabharata attributed to Vyasa are Avaidika (?!).
