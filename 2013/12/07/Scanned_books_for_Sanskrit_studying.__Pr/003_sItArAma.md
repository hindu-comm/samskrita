Some of the books that you uploaded are Sanskrit Bharati's work protected by copyright

These books are revenue source for them, this is not a good practice and as a group must not be encouraged

If something is already in the free domain and want to bring it to groups attention that's fine or if an old relic is available and want to share with group that's a different story but contemperory works should not be made available for free

That's my opinion
