Dear sunder Creative common Licensethis applies to Old books not a book published in 1999. One cannot make a copy write books into Creative common license or public domain that much I know. I am for scanning of books for preservation for personal use or to share them publicly. During this process one has to leave the publisher some wheres. It is not because one is giving free books Sanskrit will survive but due to
of authors and publishers. Please respect and care for law rules that is all. If one scans a book printed yesterday and starts giving it away for free today it is going to hurt all and Sanskrit cause will be the biggest looser. (You are not dealing with your book to give it away for free to some one else that the bottom line)
