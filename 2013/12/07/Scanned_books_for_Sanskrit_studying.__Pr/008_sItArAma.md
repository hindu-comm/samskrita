This creative common license has nothing to do with scanning Sanskrit Bhrati's books without their permission.  

This would apply if Sanskrit Bharati choose to do this instead of individuals who buy books from them. There is a clear difference.  
  

If Sanskrit Bharati is giving away books for free then its their choice but just because one paid $x to buy a book, the purchaser would not get the rights to distribute the books for free on any public domain. It does not matter what the individuals perception of copy right is. I can scan the book just for my personal use to read on iPad etc but I have no right to make it available to the community for free without their written permission
