Namaste!

  

Complete works of Jibananda Vidyasagara consisting of nearly 200 texts have been posted to the following link.

While I was searching the internet and various books on history of Sanskrit literature for a brief life sketch of Jibananda Vidyasagara, I couldn't find even a single sentence about him, though there are a number of references to his various books. Out of 200 texts edited and published by him, he has written commentaries on at least 50 texts, in addition to his original Sanskrit works like prose version of Kathasaritsagara. I wonder whether Jibananda Vidyasagara has received due recognition from Sanskrit historians.  
  
Any information about biographies or life sketches of Jivananda Vidyasagara will be highly appreciated.

shankara
