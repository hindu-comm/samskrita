Viswamitra once said -  
  

Valmiki Ramayana Balakanda Sarga 55 sloka 23

  

"dhig balam kshatriyabalam

brahmatejobalam balam /

ekena brahmadandena

sarvaastraani hataani me" //

  

धिग्बलम् क्षत्रियबलम्

ब्रह्मतेजोबलम् बलम् /

एकेन ब्रह्मदन्डेन

सर्वास्त्राणि हतानि मे //

  

Useless is the strength of a Kshatriya.

The strengh of a Brahmin is superb.

All my weapons have been destroyed

with a single weapon of a Brahmin.

  

Then he did penence for long and got the title "Rajarshi".  

He was not satisfied.

  

He continued the penance for a long time when Brahma

appeared before him and said that now he was a Brahmarshi.

But Viswamitra wanted that Vasishtha should proclaim that hewas a Brahmarshi.

  

Finally Vasishta came and proclaimed that Viswamitra was a Brahmarshi.

  

  

Valmiki Ramayana Balakanda Sarga 65 slokas 24, 25

  

ब्रह्मपुत्रो वसिष्टो माम् एवं वदतु देवता: /        

यद्ययं परम: कामःकृतो यान्तु सुरर्षभा: //  

Oh Gods. Let Vasistha the sun of Brahmasay like this. This is my last wish. Then youmay depart.

  

ततः प्रसादितो देवै:वसिष्टो जयतां वरः /

सख्यं चकार ब्रह्मर्षि-रेवमस्त्विति चाब्रवीत् //

Then entreated by the gods Vasihtha agreed and said"If so, you are a Brahmarshi".

  

There is a saying in Tamil - "aanaal Brahmarshi"
