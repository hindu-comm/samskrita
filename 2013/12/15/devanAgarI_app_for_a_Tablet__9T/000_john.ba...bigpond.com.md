Hi All,

  

This is a follow up to my post a couple of days ago. Thanks to Eddie Hadley for replying! Things have changed since my previous post.

  

I am keen to downsize from a laptop to "a laptop within the body of a tablet". I thought first of getting a MS Surface Pro 2 running Windows 8.1. I have since learned that the machine only has WI-FI capability which doesn't suit me. Irequire cellular as well.

  

QUESTION: Is anyone able to write Sanskrit in ***both roman script as well as devan훮gar카 on a tablet***? If so what is the device and the operating system (Apple, Android, Windows) and what app are you using?

  

As I mentioned in my previous post, I am starting my second year of Sanskrit at the Australian National University (ANU) in February. I will need an app that functions quickly similar to iTranslator 2003 which I currently use on my laptop under Windows 7. For a typical assignment there may be 15 sentences which must be transliterated from devan훮gar카 into roman script and then translatedinto English and another 15 vice versa. Thus, I need a fairly 'powerful' tool which will allow me to generate Sanskrit and not simply some app which after an hour I am able to send someone a short e-mail.

  

Thanks for you assistance.
