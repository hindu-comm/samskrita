dear members can anyone throw light in the meaning of swathantryam. recently i read somewhere the meaning as we use now, independence for swathantryam is not correct. it is one's upajeevanam (swa thantram). na stree swathantryamarhathi is women should be sent out for her survival and sustenance, women should be protected as she is the backbone of the family. but the current meaning as women shouldnt be given independence is so wrong.
