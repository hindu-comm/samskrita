Dear Sir,

Except the Almighty no one is independent. "दासभूताः स्वतः सर्वे हि आत्मानः परमात्मनः" इति शास्त्रं प्रमाणम्। Our senses, to be frank, are not in our control.

They are guided by the Almighty.Our birth and death also are not in our hands.

We are all dependents.When we split the word Independence, we get the word

like the following---In dependence.Hence as a matter of fact we are all dependents only.The proverb tells us "The man is a social animal". This means

the man depends on the society.

Regards,

Iviyan.
