Good finding of the meaning of "svatantra" and the criticizm of the statement of Manu. The word "tantra" has got many meanings according to Amara and other lexicons.

  

तन्त्रं प्रधाने सिद्धान्ते सूत्रवाये परिच्छदे ।। ३.३.७३१ ।  

  

Here is the meaning of the word "svatantra" as per Shabdakalpadruma with the implications in different contexts and analysis of "svatantra" and"asvatantra" according to the original sources:

  

 svatantra

  

\[L=41105\] \[p= 5-468\] svatantraḥ, tri, (svasya tantraṁ prādhānyaṁ yatra .)

svādhīnaḥ . tatparyyāyaḥ . apāvṛtaḥ 2 svairī 3

svacchandaḥ 4 niravagrahaḥ 5 . ityamaraḥ . 3 .

1 . 15 .. niryantriṇaḥ 6 yathākāmī 7 nira-

rgalaḥ 8 niraṅkuśaḥ 9 . iti jaṭādharaḥ ..

svaruciḥ 10 . iti hemacandraḥ ..

  

svatantrāsvatantravyaktayo yathā, nāradaḥ .

-----------------------------------

svātantrantu smṛtaṁ jyeṣṭhe jyaiṣṭhaṁ guṇavayaḥkṛtam .

\[Page5-468-c 52\]

asvatantrāḥ prajāḥ . sarvvāḥ svatantraḥ pṛthivīpatiḥ ..

asvatantraḥ smṛtaḥ śiṣya ācāryyasya svatantratā .

*asvatantrāḥ striyaḥ* sarvvāḥ puttrā dāsāḥ

-------------------------------------------

parigraṁhāḥ ..”'

  

The above statement gives the opinion of Narada, who are svatantra-s and who are asvatantra-s. In all the cases according to you the are having or not having subsistence allowance. Very strange observation. But the note those who are having dependence and who are independence clearly as far as I can know from the Dharmashasastra-s.

  

The above statement underlined is in accordance with Manu and other smRti- texts.

parigrahā anujīviprabhṛtayaḥ .

  

“svatantrastatra tu gṛhī yasya tat syāt kramā-

gatam .

garbhasyaiḥ sadṛśo jñeyo aṣṭamādvatsarāt śiśuḥ ..

vāla āṣoḍaśādvarṣāt paugaṇḍo'pi nigadyate .

parato vyavahārajñaḥ svatantraḥ pitarāvṛte ..

jīvatorna svatantraḥ syāt jarayāpi samanvitaḥ .

tayorapi pitā śreyān bījaprādhānyadarśanāt ..

abhāve bījino mātā tadabhāve ca pūrvvajaḥ . \* .

svatantro'pi hi yat kāryyaṁ kuryyādaprakṛtiṁ

gataḥ .

tadapyakṛtameva syādasvātantryasya hetutaḥ ..”

*iti vyavahāratattvam .*.



The above is the further analysis of dependence and independence in the family context of the social customs when the smRiti contexts were written.
