Sir;

I found a great many sources for Subhashitas, with English translations also. It will probably take my entire life to go through all the Subhashitas found in this list -- only one site Ratnabhandagar has 10,000! Here is the address: -- [sanskritdocuments.org/doc_1\_index.html](http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_1_index.html). Hope it is helpful.
