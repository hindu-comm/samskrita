Sirs/Madams,

  

I do a Sanskrit Appreciation Hour on Twitter on weekdays. Currently the schedule is slightly off because I am on study leave. However I try my best to share Sanskrit learning resources and keep posting the links to blogs, videos, articles etc. whenever I can (as I did with Sri Abhyankar's subhashita blog) If you would like me to share a link, kindly email me. And I would be happy to oblige. Making good Sanskrit resources available to my audience is one of my key aims.

thanks.
