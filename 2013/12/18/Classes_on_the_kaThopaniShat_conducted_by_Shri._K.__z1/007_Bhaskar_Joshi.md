A rich collection of Subhashita. Thanks.

  

In Shubhashitakaustubha page 7 it is mentioned

An unknown poet bemoans the state of poets as

  

follows, “अरिसके षु कǒव×विनवेदनं िशरिस मा िलख मा िलख मा

  

िलख” \[Do not ever write on my forehead the fate of reciting my

  

poetry among those who are devoid of taste.\])

  

  

This is attributed to the famous poet Kavi Magh who said :

  

इतर कर्मफलानि यदृच्छया विलिखतानि सहे चतुरानन ।

अरसिकेषु कवित्वनिवेदनं शिरसि मा लिख मा लिख मा लिख ।।

O Brahma! (चतुरानन) you may write any fruits of my karma as per your wish i will bear them

(but) please please please do not write poetry recitation in front of dry people (अरसिकेषु).

  

जय श्री कृष्ण ।
