Dear Ms. Bakshi;

Thank you for your kind offer to share your knowledge of the sources of sanskrit learning.  
Could you please list resources (on-line) on Subhashitas, including the one you mentioned (Shri. Abhyankar's blog)

  

I am so very grateful for this forum, members are such extraordinary "giving" people. Every morning I wake up with a smile due to pleasant anticipation of finding something (as usual) delightful and delectable in postings from the members of this group.

  

Thank you, thank you ALL

  

A. Iyengar
