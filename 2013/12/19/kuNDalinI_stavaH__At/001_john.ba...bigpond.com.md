Hi Harry,

Thanks for giving me an opportunity to practice Sanskrit. I haven’t had time to parse the sentences myself but when I do I will post it.

QUESTION:

You have parsed - bhāvyate passive "comes to be". According to the sources I use the passive of √bhū is bhūyate not bhāvyate.

Please investigate.

Thanks,

John
