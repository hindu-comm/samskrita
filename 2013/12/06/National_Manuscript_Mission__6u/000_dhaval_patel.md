Respected all,

Are the manuscript digitized by national manuscript mission available anywhere?

I saw on the website that there are many manuscripts digitized by them or with their help, but nowhere do I see the manuscripts.

Digitization without making them public would be a futile exercise. Why not host them like DLI ?

  

Is any one of our group member affiliated with this mission ?

Please guide me in this matter.
