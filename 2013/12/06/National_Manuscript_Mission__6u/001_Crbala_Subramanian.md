Hi Dhaval ji,  
  
You are right the manuscripts are digitised and it is residing safe in their premises.  
I will tell you my experience in approaching them. Some two months back I have visited Tanjore saraswathi Mahal Library to access two rare manuscritps belonging to rig veda branch. By seeing the website I thought like it would be easy to access the manuscript since So one has to write a letter and then only they are allowed to see the manuscripts. And the painful part is authorities of the library and even the chief in charge of the library are not so responsive even when we tell our requirement.  
  
So you can check with the manuscript conservation center nearby and check whether they allow you to check it or not. Compared to government owned manuscript library it is easy to access private library. They are very organized and the process is simple. This is my experience.  
  
  
Thanks  
C.R.Bala
