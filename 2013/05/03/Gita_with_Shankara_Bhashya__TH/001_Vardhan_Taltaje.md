There are couple of on-going talks on Bhagavadgita Shankara Bhashya and both are in English:  
  
Sri Aravinda Rao of Advaita Academy has been giving talks which are available at <http://www.livestream.com/advaita_aravindarao>. You can watch the video, but I don't think that they are downloadable.  
  
Another one is by Swami Paramarthanandaji in Chennai. The MP3 files of these can be bought from Arshavidya: <http://books.arshavidya.org/cgi-bin/process/shop/display/item?prrfnbr=110837>
