Reputed journals have a peer to peer review system. It normally take 6 months to publish an article after initial submission. Individuals not associated with academic institutions normally cannot get their articles published in reputed journals.  
  

A simpler option would be to s

elf publish. in sites like

www.

[academia.edu](http://academia.edu)

. I f you want to charge can publish in sites like scribd or amazon etc
