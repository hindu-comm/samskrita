The website you have indicated is a comprehensive resourse which gives all the editions of Mahbharatha you may need.Instead of me giving you a list of URLS please mahbharata with a various combination of letters on dli site and you will get all the editions of Mahbaharta printed Scanned and those in public domain. You can do the same in archives site also

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
