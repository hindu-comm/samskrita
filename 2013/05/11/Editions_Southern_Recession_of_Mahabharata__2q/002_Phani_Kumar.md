Namaste.

The word is "recension (Revised edition of a text-Oxford Dictionary)" .

The difficulties involved in tracing these works have been pointed out by Shri Chaturvedi Badarinath in his acknowledgements to his "The Mahabharata-An enquiry in the human condition (Orient Longman)"

I quote excerpts.

"There are two recensions of the Mahabharata,the southern and the northern, with different editions in each. In the southern recension, the Kumbakonam edition is the best known; in the northern, the Gita Press,Gorakhpur and Pune editions. The difference between the two recensions is not only in their size, the Southern omitting in some cases the material that exists in the Northern and Northern adding some material that does not exist in the southern...."

  

" On hearing my tale of woe, she (Smt. Saradamani Devi), brought out her eighteen volumes of the Mahabharata. They were not Kumbakonam but yet another edition of the southern recension, the one compiled by P.P.S. Sastry (1935) from the manuscripts at the Tanjore Palace Library."

  

In addition to the above, there appears to be a Bengal recension on which Shri Kisari Mohan Ganguly's splendid translation (Munshiram Manoharlal) depends.
