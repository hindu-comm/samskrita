The first is not grammatical derivation of the word पतत्त्र you you wished to have because you cannot get it from पतनात् त्रायते, but on the other hand you will get only पतन+त्र \> पतनत्र with the explanation you have offerred.

  

I have given the twp explanations by two grammarians in two ways. The first is पतन्तं त्रायते इति पतत्त्रम् - that protects the bird while flying (fram falling down), which is the just explanation fitting the derivation. And not पतन्तं as you have suggested. This is the difference which is not great for a non-grammarian. Both would give two different words as the grammarians have explained and not by myself. The first gives the word पतन+त्र - पतनत्र which is not the word you want and the two derivations given given by grammarians give the word पतत्त्र or पतत्र meaning the feather and several other meanings, in both the derivations which may not be great for you.

  

I have no opinion, but other members may pass their opinion on your strange remark![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/86f16e697055bed1/330.gif?part=0.1)
