Namaste all,  
  

I am sure many of us would know the famous commentary on Sri Lalita Sahasranama by Bhaskara Raya Makhi.  
  

I recently found out that this work was published in circa 1930 by M/s Nirnayasagara Press, Bombay in Devanagari.  
  

If anyone has an electronic copy or if it has already been uploaded to sites like Archive.org etc. , this is my humble request to share a copy of the same.  
  

Thank you once again.  

  

Regards,  
R. Śivarāmakṛṣṇa Śarmā
