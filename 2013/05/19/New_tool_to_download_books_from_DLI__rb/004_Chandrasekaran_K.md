Dear Arvindji

  

There is one possible way to reduce the difficulties in one area in downloading.

  

When the downloader terminates half way it leaves a several TIFF images in the cache. Adobe Photoshop has a batch process to convert these TIFF images to pdf files. PDFill pdf tools (free download from<http://www.pdfill.com/>) can compile these pdf files into a single pdf file.

  

A little bit cumbersome but, as I said, it reduces the difficulties in one area.

  

Hope this helps.
