I too could not see the icon.I was looking for the tools to be enabled, but could not find it. But if you have not enabled all other language Input Tools turned ON, you cannot see the icon. First you have to enable the Input tools under Other Languages Options in the settings. And then you have toselect from the list of available Input tools and add to the right row to enable them, both Sanskrit and Sanskrit phonetics.

The first row in the settings Display Language and then the right side of the Change language you can see show all the options.

On enabling the Input tools, you will be lead to this page to select the languages in the Input Tools from the left panel:

or any one of the above. Both should work.

  

Now you can see the icon as shown by Mahesh Rajendran has shown, when you click on new message or reply message. You will be able to use Input Tool by clicking on it and type सं स्कृतम or samskritam. by enabling and disabling the tools.![Inline image 4](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/d3dfb627248c520f/image.png?part=0.3)
