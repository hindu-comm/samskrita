Eddie,  
  
OS is Windows 7, 64 bit. I tried to run SanDic in compatibility mode. It did not work. Please see the following info on <http://www.sandic.ru/en/downloads>  
  
**sandic_w32s.exe** The compiled executable for OS MS Windows 32 *MS Windows 32*  
For other platforms, you must build executable from source code, see the Qt's [official site](http://qt.digia.com/) for more details.  

  

I do not know how to build exe file. So, is the exe file for 64 bit Windows 7 available?  

  

regards  
shankara

SanDic,  

\<==

 It can be installed only on Windows 32 bit OS. Is its version for Windows 64 bit OS available anywhere?

\<==





On the contrary, it *can* be installed and ran on a 64bit OS.



It runs under my 64bit Windows8 Pro just fine, and I don't even have to opt torun it under compatibility mode.





You don't specify which64bit Windows system you use, but compatibility mode
