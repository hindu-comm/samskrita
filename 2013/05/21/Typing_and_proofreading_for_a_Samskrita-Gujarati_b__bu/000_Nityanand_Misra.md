Namaste

  

We have a small (60 page) Samskrita-Gujarati bilingual work in the Gujarati script which was published by our Ashram in early 1990s. We now want to publish it online in Gujarati Unicode. There are many verses and citations in Samskrita due to which we need somebody well-versed in both Samskrita and Gujarati. The Ashram is willing to pay market rates for both digitization and proofreading.

  

Scholars interested may please get in touch with us over email. Please forward this to people who may be willing to take this up.

  

Regards, Nityanand

On behalf of Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas, Chitrakoot
