Just a couple of quick reminders when posting:  
  

\- When starting a thread, please specify an appropriate subject line.  
  

\- Generally, please do \*not\* cross-post questions across multiple lists, i.e., do not include multiple groups in the To / Cc fields when starting a thread. Pick a group and ask your question. If you are not satisfied with the answer after the discussion there, you could bring up the discussion in a different group.  
  
Cross-posting is ok when the email is informational and you do not expect a discussion of the message. Examples of such messages include announcement of seminars, call for papers, etc.  
  

\- If you reply to a digest, please change the subject line to reflect the thread to which you are responding, and delete unnecessary portions of the digest.  

  

If you have any questions regarding this, please write to the moderators off the list.  
  
  

Thanks,  

Naresh
