I could not run the software in winXP. It gives message that database is not found.

  

Please help. I shall be obliged if you can look for a word बह्वोदः in Bhagavata III.12.43 which has a variant बहूदः which is correct form according to Paninian grfammar. The gosvami-s all have the other reading बह्वोद which might have been accepted reading in your dictionary according to Gosvami's grammar.

  

Thanks for your effort to produce an exclusively Vaishnavaite Gosvami dictionary. The bhaktivedanta site has some sort of dictionary limited to their translations, but without any grammatical information.
