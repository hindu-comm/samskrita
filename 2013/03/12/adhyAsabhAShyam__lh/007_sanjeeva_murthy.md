Namaste,

1.ADHYASA means atasmin tadbuddhihi. i.e. misconception of a thing which is not as it appears. adhi + aasa = adhyaasa. enforcing on a non real thing as real.

Shaankara Bhaashya-- adhyaasO naama atasmin tadbuddhirtyavOchaama. ex. even though ia am different from this body , i have taken it for granted as ' i am this body'.

2\. Adhyaksha - president, presiding person .

3\. Abhyaasa - practice.

4\. if u can understand/ fallowkannada a detailed lecture is available in audio c.d. on Adhyaasa Bhaashya of Shankara.
