Thank you very much for your help everybody. I was searching for the text in order to upload it alongside a series of talks on the Adhyasa Bhashyam by Swami Sadatmananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya Kendra Trust, Bangalore. In the end I scanned the text from a book and used that. For those that are interested, the scanned text, talks and talk transcripts are all accessible on the Internet Archive here:<https://archive.org/details/adhyasabhashyam_201303>.
