I would first read a standard English translation Translation by Date,
George Thibaut in the Sacred Books of The East or the One by Swami Gambhirananda and then would move to Sanskrit originals with various commentaries.  
Though Adhaysya Bhashya is preface written by Shankar to his Bhasha on Vedanta Sutra one can find very lofty thought and sublime philosophy in the preface.

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
