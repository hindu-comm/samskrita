Adyasyasa in the context of Shankara's Adhyas Bhashya means super imposition. Please read Adhyasya Bhashya for reference.  
  
Throwing over or casting upon; misconception or erroneous attribution, the significance being that the mind casts upon facts, which are misunderstood, certain mistaken notions; hence false or erroneous attribution. Equivalent to Adhyāropa. Simply put Adhyasa means superimposition or false attribution of properties of one thing on another thing.
