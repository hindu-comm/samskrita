dvaitam, visishtaadvaitam and advaitam.





Dvaitam – preached by Maadhvaachaarya



Visishtaadvaitam – preached by Raamanujaachaarya



Advaitam – preached by Sankaraachaarya





Dvaitam - When jeevatma attains moksha it gos and sits with paramaatma

but does not merge with it – tila-tandulavat. Like sesame seed and rice.



Visishtaadvaitam - Jeevatma joins with Paramaatma but still is separate

\- laakshaa-kaashthavat - like lac covering a piece of wood.



Advaitam – Jeevatmaa merges with Paramatma and there is no separateness

like milk mixed with water. ksheera-neeravat.
