Respected Scholars,



I beg to differ from the explanation of Sri Ramakrishnan on the 'Advaitam preached by Sankaracharya'. Sankara's view is that Jivatma and Paramatma are one and the same and the one who realises it \[not merely accepts the statement or understands the statement\] is released from the Sansara Chakra or gets Mukti. There is no question of Jivatma merging, uniting or joining Paramatma.



With respects

R Subrahmanian
