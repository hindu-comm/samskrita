May I Suggest you to read any elementary books on Shankara Vedanta. There are many available at [archives.org](http://archives.org) or Digital library of India website.  
You can even sart with a popular book like Shankara's teachings with his own words by Swami Atmanada available on the web or any standard book of you choice.  
  

Advaitam – Jeevatmaa merges with Paramatma and there is no separateness like milk mixed with water.  

In Shankara's Advaita there is no question of merging. Merging happens where there are two entities or where there is a difference. How can the one and only one Brahman merge.  
  
The analogies given might be correct but the explanation offered is not sound philosophy. I cannot enter into a detailed analysis here as it might not be be within the scope of this thread
