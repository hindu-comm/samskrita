Dear Sundar ji,  
Namaste.  
  
Sometime back, in the Advaita group itself, I found the Tamil version  
of Vasudevamananam. Clearly, it is a translation from the Sanskrit.  
It must be available somewhere, though the Laghu Vasudeva Mananam of  
Swami Tapasyanandaji says that the text is not available. So, I am  
searching. Thank you very much for your efforts.
