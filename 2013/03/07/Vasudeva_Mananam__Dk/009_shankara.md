Swamiji,  
  
[worldcat.org](http://worldcat.org) is a catalogue site. There are no downloadable files. We could use the information for searching those books in leading libraries. I am sure you would be able to find the first one at Adyar Library in Chennai. I will write to you if I come across copies of the second book.  



regards  
shankara
