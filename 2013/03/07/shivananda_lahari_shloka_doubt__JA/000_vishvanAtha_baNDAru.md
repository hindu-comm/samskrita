Scholars,  
  

I have some basic doubt on one of the shlokas of shivananda lahari.  
  

It is shloka 27 and is as follows :  
  

karasthe hemAdrau giriSa nikiTasthe dhanapatau  
gRuhasthe svarBUjAmara-suraBi-chintAmaNigaNe \|  
Sirasthe SItAMSau charaNa-yugalasthe&KilaSuBe  
kamarthaM dAsye&haM Bavatu BavadarthaM mama mana: \|\| 27 \|\|   
  

My doubt is how the first two wordss are translated.  

I split them as  
  

karaH + tE + hEmAdrau  
  

and did the anvaya as  
  

tE, karaH, hEmadrau (asti)  
  

My translation was like - your hand is on (a) golden mountain.  
  

Almost all translations I saw say - golden mountain is in your hand.  
  

in my little awareness, the saptami vibhakti should have been for the *kara* shabda for this translation to be true. But definitely i am wrong some-where.  
  

It becomes more pronounced for the next similar form -  
  
nikiTasthe dhanapatau  
  

why is Saptami used for dhanapati shabda, to mean that dhanapati is near you ?  
  

I was lost on this today. Could you please get me out of this trouble ?  
  

Thanks  
Vissu
