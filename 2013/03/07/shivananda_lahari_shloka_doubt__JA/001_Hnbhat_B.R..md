Only your splitting was utterly wrong. Please re-join your split words and see if you can see the joint word you have split.

You lost not only your day with trying to split according to your limited awareness. It is the same sequence in all the cases, and the same structure which is called सति सप्तमी or Absolutive locative in English terminology. You have picked up only the first and split itself wrongly and wondering now only why it सप्तमी here also.

  

  

karasthe hemAdrau giriSa

nikiTasthe dhanapatau  
gRuhasthe svarBUjAmara-suraBi-chintAmaNigaNe \|  
Sirasthe SItAMSau

charaNa-yugalasthe KilaSuBe

Here is the correct Sanskrit writing in Devanagari

  

करस्थे हेमाद्रौ गिरिश निकिटस्थे धनपतौ

गृहस्थे स्वर्भूजामर-सुरभि-चिन्तामणिगणे ।

शिरस्थे शीतांशौ चरण-युगलस्थेऽखिलशुभे

कमर्थं दास्येऽहं भवतु भवदर्थं मम मन: ॥ २७ ॥

  

All are very simple structures, adjective + nouns, excepting the vocative गिरिश, O Girisha.

All are in सति सप्तमी which needs to be read as adverb of time in English, which is difficult to translate literally following the Sanskrit Sanskrit structure. Only literal translation could be given as the translators have done.

  

As the golden mountain stands at your hand, the lord of treasures i.e.Kubera stands by your vicinity, all the collection of Kalpadruma, Kamadhenu and cintamani stand in your house, the coolrayed moon is located in your head, and all the auspicious things lay at your duel of feet, what wealth can I shall give you? In other words, you have got all the riches of the world and there is nothing I can give you as gift. So I let give my mind devoted to you.

  

This is the meaning. According to English structure, I have rephrased the sentence.

  

Point to be noted:

\\

करे तिष्ठतीति करस्थः, तस्मिन् करस्थे and you need not split anything from the compound according to your understanding.

  

The same structure in other cases also गृहे तिष्ठतीति गृहस्थः, like the same, निकटस्थे, शिरस्थे चरणयुगलस्थे etc. which have been correctly translated from which you have to learn the structure.

  

Try for some time, the Practical Sanskrit Guide

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tutorial_wikner/wikner-rm.pdf>  

  

or

  

Apte's Students' Guide to Sanskrit Composition

  

<http://archive.org/download/StudentsGuideToSanskritComposition-VsApte1925/StudentsGuideToSanskritComposition-VsApte1925.pdf>  

  

before trying yourself the classical Sanskrit works to be aware of the structures of composition.
