Dear Group,

  

Can any learned member of the Group help me identify the source of the phrase जीवश्च कण्ठश्च ?

  

This phrase is commonly used in Marathi to indicate close or bosom friendship and is obviously of Sanskrit origin and must haveoccurred in a verse or a story. Can anyone identify it?
