Respected scholars,  
  
I am checking a certain spiritual teacher's wording for the great hymn, which is purportedly by Adi Shankara, called गुर्वष्टकम्.  
There are several versions of this hymn.  
  
The version I am checking begins with शरीरं सुरूपं सदा रोगमुक्तं ...  
  
All other versions I have seen begin with शरीरं सुरूपं तथा वा कलत्रं ...  
  
Have others in the group seen this hymn beginning with शरीरं सुरूपं सदा रोगमुक् ...? Or is such an opening unusual?  
  
I am aware of the meanings: having permanent good health/lack of disease in one case, and having a wife in the other.   
  
Any comments welcome.
