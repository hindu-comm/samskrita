NamassarvEbhyaH,



As mentioned by Sri Subhash, there is an effort by Samskrita Bharati USA to bring in Sanskrit into curriculum in US schools. In my brief involvement till date with SAFL (Sanskrit as Foreign Language), I find that many students are very sharp at grasping Sanskrit, thanks to their interest in Math (I guess). There is great interest in attending various camps organized as a part of their curriculum. The response is welcoming! However, I guess that most students currently are of Indian origin (Kids born to Indian parents in the USA).



That said, I agree with Sri Shreyas in that, there is a great need to prevent Sanskrit from vanishing from our Indian universities. It finally comes down to incentivizing Sanskrit education. In an era where a BE in Comp. Sci from any engineering college lands one in a reasonably well-paid job, a motivating factor needs to be created for people to prefer alternate careers such as Sanskrit. It is easier said than done, yes.



Regards,

Shreekrishna
