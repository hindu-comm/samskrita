As the Sanskrit language has been a great influence upon India's and the rest of South Asian civilizations for untold centuries, so it is that the Latin language, the language of the Roman Empire, has greatly influenced most aspects of Western European and North American culture(s) and civilization. One finds Latin inscriptions on public buildings, Roman numerals used in films and in print, Roman Catholic religious services being celebrated in Latin on some occasions, as well as some universities, e.g. Yale University and Harvard University in the U.S. and both Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the U.K., printing their diplomas and degrees in Latin, among many other European and North American higher education institutions. The Latin language and Roman civilization have permeated Western European and North American civilizations for centuries, as has Sanskrit permeated the many civilizations and cultures of India for thousands of years. Because the Latin language is the classical language most associated with European and North American civilizations and institutions, this reason might account for the fact that a knowledge of the Latin language is an essential foundational element of Occidental education and why Latin is still taught in a great number of public and private (independent) schools in North American to this day. A distant second classical language to Latin is classical Greek, which began to disappear from American schools as early as 1910, if classical Greek was ever taught in American schools at all. While Latin is important for the legal professional and for ecclesiastical purposes in the United States, among other uses and elsewhere in North America, a good working knowledge of classical Greek is very helpful for students aspiring to become physicians, since most of the medical terminology is based upon classical Greek, rather than Latin root words. At the present time, the study of Sanskrit is relegated to a relatively few institutions of higher education in the United States and is rarely taught as a secondary school subject in the United States, for better or for worse, I must report. The study of classical Latin and Greek is declining in the United States, so this shrinking of interest in classical languages studies among potential students of classical languages, has reduced the numbers of potential Sanskrit students even more drastically, such that those students interested in Sanskrit usually have to begin their formal studies of Sanskrit at the university level in the United States.

  

On a brighter note, there have been many extra-academic organizations that have begun teaching Sanskrit in informal camp settings and other like-minded organizations, which are engaged in the wider dissemination of Sanskrit in North America and elsewhere. Among Indians living in the United States, these efforts have instilled an appreciation of Sanskrit in Indians, residing outside of India, who have been exposed to the very strong forces of acculturation of Western and American culture(s). There also have been a number of mobile "apps" that have been recently developed to teach one how to read and write the Devanagari script in which Sanskrit (as well as some other modern Indian languages) is written, to assist students in reading, speaking and writing Sanskrit, together with a host of other special purpose Sanskrit acquisition "apps" for both mobile "smart" phones and tablet computers. Hopefully, these technologies will make more students aware of the values of the study of Sanskrit and will engender a higher degree of self-study of Sanskrit within the wider community of both students and lifetime learners in the United States and elsewhere, as well. 

  

The acquisition of modern language proficiency in modern languages by English speaking students, such as Chinese, is done for entirely different reasons. A working knowledge of a modern language, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Spanish, for example, facilitates communications between speakers of different modern languages, as well as economic activities and commerce between nations. The practical values of such proficiency in modern languages is not lost upon American students, since many of them will either be traveling to or engaging in other cultural exchanges, say, with China and doing so in Chinese. Classical languages, as a rule, such as Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, provide an appreciation and understanding of one's entire civilization and cultural evolution of centuries and millennia, in the case of Sanskrit, while the acquisition of proficiency in a modern language enables a student to communicate to a speaker of a modern language that an English speaking student has studied and provides the English speaking student with some degree of exposure and appreciation of the literature, arts and culture of the modern language that they have studied, usually depending upon how long a student has studied a modern language — the more time for study and communication in the modern language, the better, as a general rule. There have also been a large number of computer and mobile device based technologies that also have made the study of a modern language much more appealing, while reduced the usual drudgery, associated with the acquisition of a modern language to a more manageable set of relatively pleasant, interactive tasks. These language acquisition technologies also capitalize upon the many different learning styles of today's students, making the use of these technologies on mobile devices and computers much more friendly and much more accessible to the modern language learner. Modern language acquisition is propelled by a different set of needs and motivations than those for the study of a classical language, as well as a considerably larger number of modern language learning resources.

  

If some of these language acquisition technologies can be adapted for the study of Sanskrit, Sanskrit language study may flourish to a greater degree than it does now in the United States. If not, Sanskrit may simply "fade to black" in the coming decades, as the 21st Century continues to rumble along, accompanied by change and social restructuring, having a magnitude hitherto not seen upon this planet in its very long history.
