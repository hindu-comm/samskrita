Namaste,

  

Foreign language course offering in US public schools is decided by School Districts. I understand a few school districts have recognized the SAFL (Samskrit as a foreign language) Course conducted by Samskrita Bharati USA. One school district in the San Francisco Bay Area has Panjabi as a foreign language course offered in their high school. We need to continue the efforts to include Samskrit (or at least recognize Samkrita Bharati USA’s SAFL program) in as many US school districts as possible.

Best regards,
