As far as I know the United States public schooling system does not list Sanskrit (or Hindi) as an official language of study unlike Latin or Chinese. Can the learned members of this group throw some light if there is any way Sanskrit can be introduced into the schooling system  
  
Whle this is worth thinking over, the urgent need is to prevent the departments of Sanskrit in our own Univerities from virtually closing down.

I do not see the reasonhowSanskritis different from Latin for not being an official language.
