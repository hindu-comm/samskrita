Ramakrishna-mahOdaya, abhivAdayE,  
  

Absolutely. It is extremely important for people in India to preserve, learn, foster, cherish and use Samskritam. samskritEna vinA kutaH samskrRutiH! The political factions in India have ensured that while Urdu universities flourish and receive support, centers of Sanskrit Education have been disbanded altogether. It is furthermore depressing that few technical universities support Samskritam and vEdAntic research as a humanities discipline, while European languages and courses are offered. I have little to no hopes in MHRD offering any kind of direction or assistance to revive Samskritam to its rightful status amongst Indian and World languages.  
  

A revolution in such a situation is possible only if the country (at least the Hindu section of the country) takes a pledge at large, to invest time and effort into learning, using and preserving Sanskrit. May Goddess Saraswati bless us all with the sadbuddhi and sadvidyA to enable such a revolution.  
  

Namaste,  
Shreekrishna.
