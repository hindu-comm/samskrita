Sorry I had completely missed this post earlier. Appreciate the efforts for the posting. My humble thought still is there has not beensufficient "marketing" efforts to make Sanskrit be known and appreciated by more countries/people to be made as an official language. Not that the language is less richer than Latin, has lesser number of inscriptions on walls than Latin, not that fewer number of people aware ofits existence oris less modern than Latin. Marketing and lobbying seem to be the "languages" thatreach more people. I also dont believe Chinesebecame popular, official and modern language on its own without focussed efforts. Hindi is also modern, spoken by manyand India (whose main official language is Hindi) is hosting larger number of foreignersthan before. I doagreethat new technologies will make the learning Sanskrit easier.



regards
