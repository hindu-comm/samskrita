Dear Sri Subhash,



This is good information. When I studied at IIT Madras, there wasn't any course in Sanskrit. Apologies from my end for not being current about this information.I am not sure if all the IITs have a Sanskrit faculty. A quick search of IIT Madras's Humanities and Social Sciences department showed no Sanskrit faculty there. I'm guessing that this is the case with most IITs, NITs and the like. Unless this becomes a norm, there is little hope to emulate it in other colleges.



Regards,

Shreekrishna.
