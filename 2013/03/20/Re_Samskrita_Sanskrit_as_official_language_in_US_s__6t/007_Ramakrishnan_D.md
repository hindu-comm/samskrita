Dear Shreekrishna,

Namaste.  Do you not feel it necessary for the people in India to know the most advanced and oldest language of the country which contains the essence of life for all the human beings irrespective of their caste creed religion and all that depriving the children of this Nation i.e., Bharat.  The MHRD is of course not whole-heartedly supporting the language for fear of secularism and losing support from certain sections of the society.  In that respect foreign countiries like USA, Britain, Germany etc, they encourage Samskrit to be taught at the earlier stages of schooling.

Regards.

D.Ramakrishnan.
