Dear Sri chitsukha,  
  

I can't agree more regarding the need for wealthy businesses to support Sanskrit. I hope someone, somewhere takes note of this need. There are indeed numerous academic organizations which exist to support and sustain Sanskrit, but there is a need for a fitting response and turnout from intelligentsia as well, which will only arise is they see light at the end of the tunnel. As a 17 year old, I recollect engineering being an obvious choice for me, because the society around me had imprinted a "lack-of-livelihood"ness if anything other than medicine or engineering was pursued as a career choice. The fear of the society, again, is not a bit unfounded. It surely is a chicken and egg problem, but someone needs to pull a chicken out of thin air and then the egg will follow.  
  

As you have rightly remarked, humanities education is little to non-existent in India, especially at the undergraduate level for non-humanities majors. There are indeed efforts from some corners, but very feebly at that. In most IITs, it is required to earn 4 humanities courses enroute to a B.Tech degree. But what I found verily bothersome, is that while their humanities departments offer German, French and English, there is no course offered in Sanskrit! When the creme de la creme of undergrad institutions take no steps, I do not see wherewithal coming forth in other institutions. I see part of the blame resting with MHRD who may fear introducing Sanskrit as a mainstream curriculum at all levels, fear accusations of sectarianism from various anti-Hindu groups.  
  

Regarding the scenario in the USA, I think steps are being taken in the right direction certainly. We are far from it being introduced as a mainstream foreign language in school curriculum across the nation, but there has been positive interest that has been demonstrated in some major metros such as Boston, Washington DC metros, Seattle, SF Bay Area, to name a few. Hopefully, the fragrance of the language will spread quickly and other metros will catch up.  
  

Regards,  
Shreekrishna.
