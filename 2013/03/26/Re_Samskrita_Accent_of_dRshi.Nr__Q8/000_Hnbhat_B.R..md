I think you are right.

  

I have nothing to add, than identifying the forms. But finding fault with Panini is beyond my reach.

  

Thanks for finding contradiction of Panini Sutra-s.

  

Hope other learned members solve this.

  

Only Panini has listed from the above Sutra-s, many others, before sheShAt kartari parasmaipadam. After then there are a list of verbs and excepted from the rule. and also extended after the rule for the anit sUtra you have quoted.
