Now you are right. Only you did never refer to commentaries or lear how to iterpret the sUtra-s. Only that was your problem that yourself reading the sUtra-s and interpreting yourself as you can understand and not as the sUtra is required to be understood by the grammarians following the conventions for the interpretations.

  

Now, coming to the .अनुदात्तङितः means strictlyअनुदात्तेतश्च ङितश्च - as a dvandva compound the it after a dvandva compound is to be related with each of the members अनुदात्त andङित् never mind what you think. It is an adjective to dhAtoH

अनुदात्तश्च ङश्च अनुदात्तङौ, तौ इतौ यस्य सोऽनुदात्तङित्। द्वन्द्वान्ते श्रूयमाण इच्छब्दः प्रत्येकं संबध्यते।  

This is the rule for interpretation which will give the qualifying adjective for dhAtu, that gives the meaning for the compound as above. And by itself, anudAtta does not mean audaatet because you have concludedअनुदात्तेत् means "with अनुदात्त on an इत् vowel"

  

  

And in the other there is no such restriction

  

in case of any doubt, the commentary lists the roots referred to in the sUtra as anudatta root, in upadesha:

  

उपदेशे य एकाच् धातुरनुदात्तश्च तस्मादिडागमो न भवति। प्रकृत्याश्रयो ऽयं प्रतिषेधः। के पुनरुपदेशे ऽनुदात्ताः? ये तथा गणे पठ्यन्ते, त एव विस्पष्टार्थम् अनिट्कारिकासु प्रविभक्ताः  

  

  

Here is is clear that the qualification audAtta is the root stemप्रकृत्याश्रयो ऽयं प्रतिषेधः। in case of any confusion in the similarity anudAtta\~NitaH. where the qualification is on the it vowels attached to the dhAtu-s as you have done without referring to the commentaries and that is the use of the commentaries.

  

With regards
