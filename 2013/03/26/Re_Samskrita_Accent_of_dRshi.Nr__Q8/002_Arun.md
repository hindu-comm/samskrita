I have trouble understanding your reply. You introduce the enumeration of roots with अनुदात्त, which I mentioned and linked to in the first post. You advise me on how to parse अनुदात्तङित् "never mind what you think," even though it is clear that I agree with you and that my confusion was due to the nature of अनुदात्तेत्, not the विग्रह of this particular compound. And you make the assumption that I have never made recourse to commentary and have never learned to interpret these rules, when in reality I have made extensive use of commentary while studying the Ashtadhyayi and have been able to understand all parts of the text up until now. This remark, in particular, confuses me; for if you are familiar with the Ashtadhyayi and its commentaries, then I do not understand why you did not dissolve this doubt of mine with your first post.

  

That aside, thank you for your reply and for providing these relevant citations. प्रकृत्याश्रयो ऽयं प्रतिषेधः did not make sense to me at the time, since I assumed that accent in the धातुपाठ was applied just to the root itself, but now it is clear that the comment makes a distinction between accent on the प्रकृति and accent on the इत्. This was an interesting aspect of Panini's system that I had not considered, and I'm grateful to have met with a new quality of the Ashtadhyayi.

  

And I agree that I should read more commentary. I admit that the research done by S. D. Joshi and others has made me wary of traditional commentary, especially because Joshi and others argue that Patanjali and the tradition are mistaken about many important aspects of Panini's system. But that is a claim that I should evaluate for myself by reading more extensively.
