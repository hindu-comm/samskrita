Shaking hands.  



Years ago when Sri Morarji Desai was Deputy Prime Minister (or Prime Minister) of India, in a public speech mentioned that Indians should not shake hands which is a Western practice. One should only join the palms and say namaste without touching the other.



At that time I sent a letter to him quoting a verse from Ramayana that shaking hands was also prevalent in ancient times. Only emphasis is that it should be with equals. He acknowledged my letter to him. There was no internet then.



Here is the verse from Ramayana Kishkinda Kanda Sarga 5 Sloka 12

Sugriva speaks to Rama.



रोचते यदि वा सख्यं बाहुरेष प्रसरितः /

गृह्यतां पाणिना पाणि: मर्यादा बध्यतां ध्रुवा //



If you like my friendship I am extending this arm.

Hold my hand with your hand and let us enter into

a firm agreement.
