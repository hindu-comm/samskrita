My father was a Sanskrit scholar.  He was also conversant with the various slokas attributed to Sankaracharya.

  

I had heard from him that he had come across only one grammatical mistake of Sankaracharya. He quotes fromthe uma-maheswara-stotram -

  

namaḥ śivābhyāṃ jaṭilandharābhyāṃ

jarāmṛtibhyāṃ ca vivarjitābhyām \|

janārdanābjodbhavapūjitābhyāṃ

namo namaḥ śaṅkarapārvatībhyām \|\| 10 \|

  

Here jatilamdharaabhyaam should be jataadharaabhyam.

  

I put this in the group for discussion.
