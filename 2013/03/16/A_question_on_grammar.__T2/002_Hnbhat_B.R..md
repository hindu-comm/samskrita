This question has been once raised earlier in this group itself and was tried:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/3KQj_fx2sgM/CFL92dETyG4J>

  

and जलंधर is not aluk-samasa. It can can be a simple संज्ञा with जल+धारि - derived with खच् suffix by 3-2-46 संज्ञायां भृतृवृजिधारिसहितपिदमः . I don't think there is aluk for द्वितीया in the अलुक् प्रकरण.

  

Or the alternative reading possible be जटि*क*न्धराभ्यां

which is possible to be confused with ल.
