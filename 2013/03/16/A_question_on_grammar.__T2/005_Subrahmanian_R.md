Respected Sirs,



I could not understand the point raised by Sri Ramakrishnan. Is it that Jatila is incorrect. This word is used by Adi Sankara elsewhere also - ' *jatilo mundi lunchita kesa:'.* The word Jatila is found in Dictionary - eg cologne:

|            |     |                                                                                                                                       |     | |------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----| |            |     |                                                                                                                                       |     | | **jaTila** |     | mf({A})n. (g. {picchA7di}) = {-TA-dhArin} Mn. ii f. MBh. Hariv. &c. hairy (the face) MBh. vii , 93 , 47 ; twisted together (the hair) |     | |            |     |                                                                                                                                       |     |

If it relates to 'Samasa', I withdraw with apologies as it is above my head.



With respects
