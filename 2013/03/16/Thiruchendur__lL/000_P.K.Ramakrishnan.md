Thiruchendur



The famous temple dedicated to Subrahmanya stands

in front of the sea. I could not find the meaning of this

word Thiruchendur anywhere in various descriptions.

But I could find its etymology after reading the praise

of Subrahmania in the Subrahmania-bhujangam of Adi

Sankaracharya.



In verse 31 he says

नमः सिन्धवे सिन्धुदेशाय तुभ्यं  
पुनः स्कन्दमूर्ते नमस्ते नमोऽस्तु ॥३१॥



Here he uses the word sindhudesa as the land of

Skanda. sindhudesa becomes sindhuvur in Tamil and

again become chendur. Thiru is the tamil equivalent for

Sri. So Sri Sindhu Desa becomes Thiruchendur.
