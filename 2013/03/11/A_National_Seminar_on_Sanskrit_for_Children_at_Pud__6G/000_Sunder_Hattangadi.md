Giving her views on Sanskrit, Mother of Sri Aurobindo Ashram said: *“Every child born in India should know it, just as every child born in France has to know French.”*



Now, the question is how to bring Sanskrit to every child of India? This is a herculean task before all those concerned about Sanskrit education in India. But it is a matter of regret that we have not been able to create enough study material required to bring Sanskrit to the children of various age groups. The material needs to be appropriate and up-to-date with modern environment in which today’s children grow. An enormous amount of work, with utmost care and sincerity, needs to be done towards this worthy purpose. What is equally important is that the contents of the newly created works should be in congruence with the spirit of Sanskrit. And there should be no compromise with quality at any level. All that we prepare has to be of highest international standards.



Keeping this aspiration and valuable purpose in mind, Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC) is taking a first step by organizing a **National Seminar on Sanskrit for Children**. The Seminar will be held on 13th & 14th April 2013 in Puducherry. The purpose of the Seminar is to generate more ideas on the subject of Sanskrit education and involve experts in planning, preparing and delivering various learning materials. The tentative topics for discussion and presentation are as follows -

1.  Making Sanskrit Relevant to Children in the Present Times. 2.  Importance and Teaching of Sanskrit at Nursery and Primary Levels in
    Achieving the Objectives of True Education. 3.  Sanskrit as a Tool for Instilling Values in Children. 4.  Preparing Teacher Training Materials for the Nursery and Primary
    Level Sanskrit Teachers. 5.  Networking of Organizations Engaged in Creating Innovative Materials
    for Teaching Sanskrit to the Children. 6.  Digital and Printed Materials for Teaching Sanskrit to the Children. 7.  Translation of Existing Materials from Other Indian languages to
    Sanskrit. 8.  Preparation of Innovative Sanskrit Learning Materials for Children. 9.  Storytelling in Sanskrit. 10. Teaching Through Mantras, Shlokas, Songs and Nursery Rhymes. 11. Learning Activities and Games for Teaching Sanskrit. 12. Development Scenarios/Possibilities for Promoting Sanskrit for
    Children in and Outside Schools.
