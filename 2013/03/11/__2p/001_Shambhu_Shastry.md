namaste.  
  
Dheera vs. veera - there is day-night like difference, not just subtle.  
  
Dheera is a highly learned person with keen intellect, often of spiritual realm, attained through yoga - yogena drtendriyA mahAtmanah. He is the wise sage, a RiSi. He is the kavi of the Vedas. Dhee is buddhi, intellect, that we seek re-kindled through the gAyatrI mantra. A dheera's source of abhaya is his jnaanam and experience of the One Brahman. Nothing less than amrtatvam is his goal.  
  
In contrast, a veera is physically strong which alone is his source of abhaya. Bhasmaasura or Alexander was a Veera. Mohini or the monk who faced them respectively was a dheera. Veera gazes and tries to master the secular world. If devoid of yoga, he is prone to think that that is all there is. If dheera is often wise, a mere veera is often a stupid fool. A youth is urged to become a veera and then grow up to a dheera.  
  
sAvitrI sUryA calls herself as veerasU (mother of veeras) and devakAmA (Rigveda 10-75-44), a wish aired to the brides in our present-day marriage ceremonies.  
  
dheera in Rigveda 3-8-4, 3-8-5, 5-45-10, 9-73-3, 10-71-2, 10-114-7, 10-114-9,...  
dheera in yajuarAraNyaka (puruSa sUkta - sarvANi rUpANi vichitya dheerah, tasya dheerah parijaananti...)  
Many Upanishads refer to a spiritual master as dheera. Example: Isha mantras 10 and 13.  
dheera in bharatanAtyam - a nAyika bhAva.
