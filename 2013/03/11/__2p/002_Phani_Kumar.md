पराञ्चिखानिव्यतृणत्स्वयंभू

स्तस्मात्पराज्ञ्पश्यति नान्तरात्मन्

कश्चिद्धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्ष

दावृत्तचक्षुरमृतत्वमिच्छन्।।

  

In this sloka of Kathopanishat, धीरःsabda is used in the sense ofज्ञानी।  Expressions like स्थितधीः (while describing स्थितप्रज्ञस्य qualities) in the Gita are other examples. The sabda veera, on the other hand, does not have any such connotations. It is bravery, pure and simple.
