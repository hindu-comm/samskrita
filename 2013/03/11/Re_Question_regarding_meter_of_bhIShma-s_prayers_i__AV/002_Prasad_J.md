Respected scholars,  
  
I was reading Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Prayers of Bhīṣma in first skandha ninth adhyāya. In that Bhīṣma, glorifies Lord Kṛṣṇa in a chanda (meter), which has 12 syllables in first and third pāda and 13 syllables in second and fourth pāda. I searched through chando-mañjarī about this meter, however couldn’t find one. I also searched through this group if this topic is discussed before, however I could not find it. Below is one of the prayers of Bhīṣma. I request the scholars of this group to go through it and please let me know this meter and also how to sing it (i.e. suitable breaks of this meter).  
  
iti matir upakalpitā vitṛṣṇā  
bhagavati sātvata-puṅgave vibhūmni  
sva-sukham upagate kvacid vihartuṁ  
prakṛtim upeyuṣi yad-bhava-pravāhaḥ  
  
  

Regards,  
Prasad J.
