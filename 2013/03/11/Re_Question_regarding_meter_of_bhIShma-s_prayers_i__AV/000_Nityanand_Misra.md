It is the mellifluous puṣpitāgrā metre which is an ardhasamavṛtta.  
  
Odd feet are na-na-ra-ya. Even feet are na-ja-la-ra-ya.  
  
Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has ten verses in this metre, with the name of the verse puṣpitāgrā also fitted in the verse itself (19-85)  
  
avihatagatirevamūrdhvaretā dvijakulaśasyaghano manojajetā।  
vibudhavaralatāmivaitya kīrtiṃ trijagati rāma ramasva puṣpitāgrām॥ 19-85 ॥
