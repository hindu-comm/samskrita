I don't think it was a problem for the dramatists or viewers. Actors will learn to recite any dialogue in any language efficiently. The viewers were capable of understanding and enjoying the languages used in Sanskrit drama-s.

and if one wants to say anything, he will change the language. But all the languages are related Sanskrit and the dialects of Prakrit. And not certainly Hebrew, Arabic or English for which one would have had to go abroad or learn from convent schools or madrasa-s.

  

It is only problem for us who do not want anything but Sanskrit and despise everything else that we do not know,

  

Here is an explanation of what is meant by भाषाविधान in नाटक-s:
