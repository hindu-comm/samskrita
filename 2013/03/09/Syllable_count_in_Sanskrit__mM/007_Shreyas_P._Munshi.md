Subject: Re: \[Samskrita\] Syllable count in Sanskrit  

नमस्ते श्रीमन् श्रेयस-महोदय !  

विसर्गः is not a separate syllable. **Thank you, Sir, for affirming it!**In a word as रामः the विसर्गः is part of theवर्णःमः For syllable-count also, मः is to be taken as one syllable count only. The विसर्गः increases मात्रा, not the number of वर्ण-s.मात्रा of मis 1, whereas that of मः is 2. Both म and मः are वर्ण-s having different मात्रा-count. Syllable(वर्ण)-count and मात्रा-count are again two different things.

1.  In my analyses of meters I always mention वर्ण-count and
    मात्रा-count separately. **I have been seeing you doing that,
    Sir.**  

1.  I have been listening to people pronouncing मः as मह. Frankly, I am
    very uncomfortable with such pronunciation. But I am left wondering
    what I can do about it. It is like wanting to correct
    pronunciation-habits of people who are wont to pronounce स्त्री as
    इस्त्री. Habits are hard to beat, right ?

1.  1. **I am reminded of the story of that simpleton who was
    carrying a small calf on his shoulders, and three thugs, one after
    the other, kept on calling him a fool for carrying a donkey. Finally
    he dumped the animal, brain-washed to believing that it really was a
    donkey that he was carrying! For almost 40 years now, I have been
    bombarded with 'aha', aahaa, ihi, uhu, for visarga preceded by one
    of these vowels. Thank God, my faith in my scholarly school teachers
    saved me from getting brain-washed and today with what you and
    Kolhatkar Sir (and now Dr Vaidya as well) have explained, I am
    **स्थितोऽस्मि गतसन्देहः(in a way स्मृतिर्लब्ध्वा!!! Thank you all.)

2.  Instead of blaming the people who pronounce मः as मह, the blame
    should rather be owned by the people who teach them so. Not only
    that they teach so, they insist that मः should be pronounced as मह
    only ! Such adamant insistence teachers is worrisome.And teachers
    don’t like if this is pointed out to them. But my teacher is nice,
    she listens to logical arguments; and before discussing with her I
    wanted to be sure and that is why I referred this query to the
    scholars in the group. I think if I can convince at least one
    teacher, I would have taken the step in the right direction among I
    don't think teaching people to pronounce मः as मः and not as मह is
    as challenging as wanting to correct pronunciation of people who are
    wont to pronounce स्त्री as इस्त्री.Ya! Like a post –graduate in
    English roaring “i-stop, i-stand i-straight and i-state your
    i-story!
