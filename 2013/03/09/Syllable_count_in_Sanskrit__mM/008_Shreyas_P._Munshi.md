DeeJayVaidya Sir,

  
*A slight correction. Syllable is "akShara",*  

**Oh, so now I understandwhy in BhagvadGeeta, Bhagwan describes the monosyllabic sound 'OM' as 'ekaaksharI'!**

**Thank you Dr Vaidya Sir.**

**So can we say that the ekaaksharI 'OM' has one and a half varNa and two and a half 'maatraa's? The learning now becomes very interesting!**

**...Shreyas**

A slight correction. Syllable is "akShara", an akShara can have multiple varNa components. The word pAN-Da-vAH has three akShara. The first akShara "pAN" has three varNa within it.
