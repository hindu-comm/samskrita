Subject: Re: \[Samskrita\] Syllable count in Sanskrit  

Shreyasji,

  

\<I find that if युयुत्सवः is pronounced as 'yuyutsavaha' there are five syllables and ifमामकाः is pronounced as 'maamakaahaa' there are four syllables because of which the syllable count becomes nine (instead of eight required by the anusThupa chhanda) in the relevant lines of the very first shloka of BhagvadGeeta.The syllable count becomes four if युयुत्सवः is pronounced 'yuyutsavah'and three if मामकाःis pronounced 'maamakaah'\>

  

The second alternative that you propose is the correct one. **I am so relieved. Our teachers in school, some sixty years ago, were very clear, as I find you are, that visarga should not increase the syllable count.** युयुत्सवः is not pronounced as 'yuyutsavaha' but as 'yu-yut-sa-vah' and has four syllables, not five. Similarlyमामकाः is not'maamakaahaa' but'maa-ma-kaah' and has three syllable, not four.
Had'maamakaahaa' been the correct pronunciation, पाण्डवाः would have been 'paaNDavaahaa' and, in that case, the संधि in the same line, पाण्डवाश्चैव, would not have been possible.**This is a masterly convincing argument and example. If the visarga is to be replaced by a swaraant 'h' (h+a/aa/i/u etc), the whole visarga sandhi rule would become redundant! Thank you very much, Kolhatkar Sir.**
