If the very first varNa "a" can have several regional variations (Punjabi 'a' vs. Benarasi 'a' vs. Bengali 'a' vs. Malayali 'a' and so on), then it is hardly surprising that are variations in 'aH'. I think the best we can do is listen to pronunciation of say, pandits in Varanasi or Sringeri or elsewhere and follow pronunciations that are naturally closer to one's own.  
  

At least as long as don't make रामः रामहा, I think we are reasonably ok!  
  

(Note to beginners - रामहा = रामहन्तकः ; Indra is वृत्रहा and not वृत्रः)
