Respected Naresh Cuntoor-ji,

*At least as long as don't make रामः रामहा, I think we are reasonably ok!*

**That seems to be a very good way of summarizing the discussion. With your above comment added, I think I have got the answer to my query, and my doubt is cleared.**

**Thank you, Abhyankar-ji, Kolhatkar-ji,Dhananjay-jiand all,**

**...Regards...Shreyas
