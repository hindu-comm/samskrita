Dear Abhyankar Mahodaya,

I am now suspecting my pronunciation may be incorrect. Here is what I have been taugt by my guru (for vedic texts) -  
  

1. The visaraga, as much as possible gets combined into other letters via the *visaga sandhi.  
*

*2.* Where the following letters (following the visarga) are either of pa or ka, the visarga sandhi can't be applied, and the visarga needs to be pronounced in *half measure*.  

3. When the following letter is a *ksha*, then the visarga needs to be pronounced fully. In my view, this is almost like a a *ha*.  
  

My understanding is that this pronunciation is probably the same in normal usage. Is this any different ? Would it be possible for you to share some audio where the difference can be easily understood ?  
  

Thanks  

Vissu
