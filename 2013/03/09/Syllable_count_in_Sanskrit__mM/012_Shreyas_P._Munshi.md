Dr Dhananjay Sir,

*mahAprANa is what is called "aspiration" in English textbooks of phonetics. There is probably no controversy (all authorities were in agreement) that the visarga is mahAprANa.

The visarjanIya is described in the taittirIya prAtishAkhya as UShman. So it is not plosive or stop.**That's a good point.** **And so the visargasurely cannot be represented as full-fledged ह, हाहिetc unlike what some seem to be doing.**It is a fricative (with not much friction, though), that must be close enough to a sibilant sound that some authorities heard it that way. Slightly different, perhaps, so that not all authorities heard it that way: that is why I think the friction may be not too much.  
  
The sthAna is mostly given as kaNThya, though the minority opinion that it was articulated at the same place as the preceding vowel - i.e., a voiceless maybe-fricative articulated at the the velum after a/A, lips after u/U etc.**Maybe like** **\[v\]ʰ where the superscriptʰ represents the fricative-like aspiration after the vowel. No?**

**If 'aspiration'=mahAprANa.=visarga, the difference betwen the aspiration used in English and Sanskrit would seem be that in English, the aspiration comes after the word-initial or syllable-initial unvoiced consonats (like pin, tin, p of IPApronounced as** /p**ʰin/, /t**ʰin/ /aipʰiei/), whereas the visarga aspiration in Sanskrit seems to come after vowels as in /rAma**ʰ/, /rAmayo**ʰ/, /rAmai**ʰ/(using examples in sing, dual and plu number). But one thing is certain: it is not the full-fledgedह, हा हि etc.**********
