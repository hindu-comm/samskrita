Respected Dr Dhananjay Vaidya Sir,

  

*The visarga is aghoSha*



**Does aghoSha mean voiceless ?**

**In Linguistics they taught us that**

**'ka' is (un-aspirated) voiceless velar plosive.**

**'kha' is aspirated voiceless velar plosive.**

**'ga' is (un-aspirated) voiced velar plosive.**

**''gha' is aspirated voiced velar plosive.**



The 'h' sound heard in visarga seems to be glottal, not velar. Is it un-aspirated voiceless stop? or un-aspirated voiced stop? or aspirated unvoiced stop? or aspirated voiced stop?

At one place (elsewhere) a sound's description included the term 'mahaapraaNa'. What does it mean?

...Shreyas
