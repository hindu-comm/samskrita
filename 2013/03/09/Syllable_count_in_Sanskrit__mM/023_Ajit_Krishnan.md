namaste,



Two different collections of commentaries on the gayatri mantra are available from <http://www.aupasana.com/ahnika>.



The commentary by Painganadu Ganapati Shastri (in the gayatri shishartha mala document) talks about both variations. According to him, the "Ni" prayoga is used in homa, while the other prayoga is used for nitya japa.



I have seen this distinction observed in practice .... usually in the vaTu's first yajur upakarma (talai avani avittam) which is the only time that many astikas actually perform the gayatri homa (even though the yearly prAyashcitta-gayatrI-japa is actually the gauNa-karma, and gayatri-homa is the pradhAna-karma).



sasneham,



 ajit
