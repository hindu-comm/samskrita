Respected Scholars,

  

It poses a problem to understand the proper pronounciation of various sounds through another language - say the vowels and consonants. It is true that the sounds have been clearly defined. But still problems arise to beginners like me.

  

It was enlightening to learn one of the scholastic members that while the consonant 'h' is voiced \[ghosha\] the visarga is unvoiced. Other common languages \[to the limited extent I know\] do not have voiced 'h' and unvoiced 'h' \[ghosha and aghosha\]. That is one of my difficulty.

  

In the English language, I learnt that 'aspirate' means breathing upon a following vowel. \[There was a good demonstration in the movie 'My Fair Lady' - a Sanskrit professor teaching proper English !\]. Of the four ऊष्माण - श, ष, स, ह - English does not have the equivalent of श - perhaps it is so in many languages. English has voiced and unvoiced variations for S, F, Sh - Z, V and Zh. English treats 'th' also in this category \[continuant\] and the voiced version is 'dh' as in they or them.

  

For me, not being a native speaker, F and V do not resemble, but I am unable to distinguish between V and W - Vest and West are same to me, because of my inability to distinguish.

  

Similarly, except for those properly initiated, it would be difficult to understand or produce voiced and unvoiced varieties of 'h'. I am in no disputing or raising doubts on the mature explanations given. I am only lamenting over my position - though one can understand the definition, difficult to produce or distinguish in hearing.

  

Pranams
