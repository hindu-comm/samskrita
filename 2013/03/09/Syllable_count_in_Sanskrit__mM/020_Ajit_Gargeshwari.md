Gayatri Mantra is Vedic mantra and is normally recited with accents. Your guru or your family in which you have learnt is the best guide  
Vedic pronunciations are fixed as per the Samhita or Shakha one follows.  
  
The important point is, I recite the way my father or Guru recites and he recited the way his guru or father did. This is how the Vedic mantras are learnt, recited and transmitted from thousands of years.

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
