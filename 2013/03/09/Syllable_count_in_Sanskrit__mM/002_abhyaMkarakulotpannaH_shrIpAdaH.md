नमस्ते श्रीमन् श्रेयस-महोदय !  

विसर्गः is not a separate syllable. In a word as रामः the विसर्गः is part of theवर्णःमः For syllable-count also, मः is to be taken as one syllable count only. The विसर्गः increases मात्रा, not the number of वर्ण-s.मात्रा of मis 1, whereas that of मः is 2. Both म and मः are वर्ण-s having different मात्रा-count. Syllable(वर्ण)-count and मात्रा-count are again two different things.

1.  In my analyses of meters I always mention वर्ण-count and
    मात्रा-count separately.  

I have been listening to people pronouncing मः as मह. Frankly, I am very uncomfortable with such pronunciation. But I am left wondering what I can do about it. It is like wanting to correct pronunciation-habits of people who are wont to pronounce स्त्री as इस्त्री. Habits are hard to beat, right ?  

Instead of blaming the people who pronounce मः as मह, the blame should rather be owned by the people who teach them so. Not only that they teach so, they insist that मः should be pronounced as मह only ! Such adamant insistence among teachers is worrisome. I don't think teaching people to pronounce मः as मः and not as मह is as challenging as wanting to correct pronunciation of people who are wont to pronounce स्त्री as इस्त्री.
