Respected scholars of the group,  
Accoeding to "spoken [sanskrit.de](http://sanskrit.de)" online dictionary, the word 'syllable' translates as 'varNa' in Sanskrit. And shri Abhyankarji, in his Geeta Sanskrit lessons describes  
anusThupa chhanda as the one in which each line has eight 'varNa'. I have a doubt in the syllable count.  
  
My question is: how many syllables are there in the word युयुत्सवः and how many in the word मामकाः ?  
I find that if युयुत्सवः is pronounced as 'yuyutsavaha' there are five syllables and if  
मामकाः is pronounced as 'maamakaahaa'there are four syllables because of which the syllable count becomes nine (instead of eight required by the anusThupa chhanda) in the relevant lines of the very first shloka of BhagvadGeeta.  
The syllable count becomes four if युयुत्सवः is pronounced 'yuyutsavah'and three if मामकाः  
is pronounced 'maamakaah' and then each line gives a syllable count of eight.  
  
Which is the correct way of pronouncing?  
  
This doubt has come up because in the text book which is used for our Sanskrit third level class, it is mentioned that रामः should be pronounced as 'raamaha' and  
नदीः sould be pronounced as 'nadiihii' each with three syllable whereas in the school we were told these are two-syllable words.  
Would you Kindly throw light and oblige.
