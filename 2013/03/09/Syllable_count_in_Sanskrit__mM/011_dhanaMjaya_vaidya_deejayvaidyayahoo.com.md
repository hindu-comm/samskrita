The visarjanIya is described in the taittirIya prAtishAkhya as UShman. So it is not plosive or stop. It is a fricative (with not much friction, though), that must be close enough to a sibilant sound that some authorities heard it that way. Slightly different, perhaps, so that not all authorities heard it that way: that is why I think the friction may be not too much.  
  
The sthAna is mostly given as kaNThya, though the minority opinion that it was articulated at the same place as the preceding vowel - i.e., a voiceless maybe-fricative articulated at the the velum after a/A, lips after u/U etc.  
  
mahAprANa is what is called "aspiration" in English textbooks of phonetics. There is probably no controversy (all authorities were in agreement) that the visarga is mahAprANa.
