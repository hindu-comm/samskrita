Dear list members,  
  
In Coulson's Sanskrit textbook he has this exercise:  
Translate to Sanskrit: "We have seen the garden with interest"  
to which he gives the answer:  
dṛṣṭaṁ kutūhalenāsmābhir udyānam \|  
  
Is it also correct Sanskrit to write:  
dṛṣṭaṁ kutūhalair asmābhir udyānam \|  
I.e. "We with interest have seen the garden"  
  
Man;y thanks,  
Harry
