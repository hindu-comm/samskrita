Are you trying to translate from Sanskrit to English or English to Sanskrit? Better not to transfer the syntax of each other. Coulson's translation is keeping the Sanskrit idiomatic usage, though there is no strictly speaking, any word order like English Language, while translating the English translation and correct.

  

It seems you have somehow distorted the English Sentence.
