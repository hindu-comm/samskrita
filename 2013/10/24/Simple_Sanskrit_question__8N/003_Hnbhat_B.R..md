Sorry.

  

I replied without trying clarify your confusion.

  

In Coulson's English translation to Sanskrit Sentence, the original is idiomatic in English and it is equally idiomatic in Sanskrit, irrespective of the change of voice. Both give the same idea and need not transfer the structure of the origin language into target language, if it is idiomatic for both the languages. Now, grammatically, analysed, the English sentence is in Active Voice, and the Sanskrit Sentence is in Passive Voice. And in both, with interest, is used as adverb, at least, adverbial phrase in English and in Sanskrit it is used in the similar way, the Instrumental case is used. and not as adjective.

  

I think you wanted it, to be used as adjectival phrase for We, which is not possible as it is used generally in Singular as adverb and never used as adjective. So कुतूहलैः doesn't meaning anything in the sentence and never gives the meaning you intended. Instead, if you want it to be related to We, it should either be clear,

  

कुतूहलेन सहितैः, or कुतूहलिभिः, or सकुतूहलैः, अस्माभिः, दृष्टमुद्यानम्।

  

"We, interested, saw the garden"

would be closest English translation.

  

As suggested by Mm. Kulkarni, it is always used in Singular, as an adverb, in the Instrumental case, meaning with interest, or out of interest.

  

The active voice of English kept in Sanskrit also, would give a similar sentence:

  

सकुतूहलं or कुतूहलेन वयमुद्यानं दृष्टवन्तः।

  

or

  

सकुतूहलं or कुतूहलेनास्माभिरुद्यानं दृष्टम्।

  

  

Hope this makes it clear.
