Dear Members,

  

Since many of us regularly consult the Monier-Williams Dictionary, I enclose below as a pdf file the brief biographical details about him that I found in an old book called 'Dictionary of Indian Biography, from [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

Arvind Kolhatkar, Toronto, October 08, 2013.
