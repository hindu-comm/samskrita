Arvind,





 There's a detailedentry on Wikipedia, complete with 'photo taken byLewis Caroll.



Andmore on Wikisource.



Of course, heintroduces himself at length in theintroduction in the Dictionary itself.



Not to well-known is the existence ofthe dictionary'scounterpart. HisMW English - Sanskrit dictionary.



As regards the later, I have yet to discover aversion available for viewing on-line.



It does not have definitions as in the Sanskrit - English version, justtheentry word in English and wordlists of Sanskrit equivalents in Devanāgarī. Even so one such, with word search capability would be most useful.
