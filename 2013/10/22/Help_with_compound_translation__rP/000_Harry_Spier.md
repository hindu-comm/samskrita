Dear list members,  
  
In the Annapurnastotram 2nd verse beginning:  

nānāratnavicitrabhūṣaṇakarī hemāmbarāḍambarī  
muktāhāravilambamānavilasadvakṣojakumbhāntarī \|

Can someone help me with the translation of the compound:  
hemāmbarāḍambarī

1) Is it divide up as:  
hema-ambara-āḍambarī

2\) If this is the case then how is -āḍambarī understood in this compound.

  

Many thanks,

Harry
