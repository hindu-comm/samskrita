Dear list members,  

  

I was asked for the correct Sanskrit name and spelling for the holiday
"Dassera" . In Kane's History of Dharmasastra he has the name of the holiday as both

vijayā-daśamī and dasarā. But I couldn't find dasarā in Monier-Williams or Apte. 

  

What is the holiday usually called? I

s dasarā a sanskrit name or is it from one of the vernacular languages of India?

  

Thanks,

Harry
