VS Apte's

  



I don't think it is a Sanskrit name as it is spelt and a corrupt form of regional languages, meaning 10th night or so. or tenth day - from दशमी. Or somehow it can be related to Sanskrit by hooks or crooks of Sanskrit etymological devices, but not any direct usage as such is found in the classical language.

  

VS Apte's Dictionary also has the similar entry, as PV Kane,

  

5. विजया vijayā : (page 1433)

जयां च (अध्यापिपत्) Bk.2.21.-4 Hemp. -5 N. of a festival = विजयोत्सवा, see below.-6 Yellow myrobalan.-Comp.-उत्सवः a festival in honour of Durgā held on the 1th day of the bright half of Āśvina.-दशमी the tenth day of the bright half of Āśvina, observed as a great holiday and ***commonly known as Dasarā.***

  

It can be noted that he also doesn't any independent entry for the word in his dictionary.
