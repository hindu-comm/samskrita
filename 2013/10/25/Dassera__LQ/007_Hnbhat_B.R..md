Very good idea. Every festival is related to some of the Puranic episode, according to the belief of the regional people as given in the following

  

Vijayadashami also known as Dasara, Dashahara, Dussehra, Dashain (in Nepal), Navratri or Durgotsav is one of the most important Hindu festivals celebrated in various forms, across Nepal, India and Bangladesh.  

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayadashami#Dasha-Hara_in_different_parts_of_India>  

  

whether it be Rama defeated Ravana, (Ramayana) or Pandava-s worshipped their Ayudha-s on the Shami tree (in Mahabharata) before the war, or Goddess Durga, killed Mahishasura, or in always, any victory holy celebrated by different people on that day.

  

This is the given derivation in the above article:

  

The name Dussehra is also derived from[Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")Dasha + Ahaha = Dasharahaha = Dasharaha. Ahaha means day .  



It seems they have some vague derivation with misspelt Sanskrit Sanskrit words:

  

दश+अहन् - would give दशाह, ten days. It is far from the relation दुस्सेहरा dussehra as spelt in noth, the same as दशरा or दसरा in south. The different events are given in the article itself.

  

Good Article informative on the festival विजयदशमी the tenth day celebration of the victory. (which victory, the name doesn't specify). Still corrupt is again Sanskrit word विद्यादशमी as it is also know, the children are initiated to learning writing, on that day. विद्यारम्भ is the day of fresh admissions in some schools, respecting this custom, irrespective of the regular Govt. Schools' admission time of reopening for the academic year.
