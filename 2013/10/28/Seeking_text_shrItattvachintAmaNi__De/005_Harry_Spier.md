Dear Brian,  

  

This text in both searchable transliteration as a text file and in devanagari pdf is available in the Muktabodha digital library.
<http://muktalib5.org/digital_library.htm>

  

For the list members who may not be aware of it, the Muktabodha digital library consists of two main collections. One of which is a collection of about 250 searchable etexts which is aimed at giving a cross-section of the tantric/agamic literature. We are adding to this collection all the time. This also has a sophisticated search engine using what are known as "regular expressions" which allows you to search for the same or similar passages with variations across the collection and presents the results in a two panel format to facilitate the recognition of parallel passages in different texts. 

  

The second collection also accessable from the link above is a joint project of Muktabodha Indological Research Institute, the French Institute of Pondicherry, and the Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient (French School of Asian Studies).and is the on-line collection of the paper transcripts of the Saivite manuscripts of the IFP in Pondicherry.
This consists of photographic facsimiles of over 1000 transcripts containing over 4000 texts mainly of the Saiva Siddhanta and is the largest collection of Saiva Siddhanta texts in the world. THese transcripts are all in devanagari transcribed under the direction of N. R. Bhatt starting in the 1950's from the southern scripts.

Harry Spier
