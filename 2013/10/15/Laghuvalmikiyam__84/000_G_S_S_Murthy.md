Dear all,

Laghuvalmikiyam, an abridged version of Valmiki Ramayan, can be freely downloaded from

<http://www.scribd.com/doc/176234676/Laghuvalmikiyam-%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%98%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D>

The language is Sanskrit and script Devanagari. Contains about 17250 (File size in PDF is about 7MB) lines of Valmiki's (mostly) verses. Abridgement is done by me and I am solely responsible for any errors and blemishes.

Regards

Murthy
