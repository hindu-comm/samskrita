Hi All,  
  
Have any of the members here came across any open source Astadyahi sanskrit word compiler or decompiler.  
I wanted to learn Astadhyayi by tweaking the code to create a translator of Sanskrit to English.  
I promise to provide all courtesy and credit .  
Also I would like to know like minded people who would like to work on this tool. I can provide you only limited remuneration for now but more than that we can achieve a lot bigger level in creating an enterprise system where you may foresee to achive your bigger aspirations. Plain and simple, I am looking to create a serious team for this work. Keep my commitment for now please!  
  
Those interested can write me personally at [prabh...@gmail.com]()  
  
Thanks  
Prabhat
