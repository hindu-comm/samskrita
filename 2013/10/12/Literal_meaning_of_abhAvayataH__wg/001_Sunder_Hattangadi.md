In Shankara's Gita Bhashya, he defines it as: Atmaj\~nAna abhinivesham akurvataH . Apte Dictionary defines (one of many) abhinivesha as 'ardent desire'. To extrapolate this even further one may call it 'mumukShutvam'.  

  

The literal meanings being many, the context as understood by the translator would determine the language of the translation.
