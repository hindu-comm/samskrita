Is the literal translation by yourself or from any text?

  

First of all, why do you stick to literal meaning? Is it to make the meaning out of context or to understand the meaning in the context?

  

In the first, it is of no avail as the meaning derived so would be out of context anyway and would not make in any way the meaning clear in the context.

  

In the second, Sundar has made it clear that literal usages being many, according to the context only one has to translate and according to his understanding of the context. So in translation, there may be many more variant words to express, what the translator has understood from the context.

  

Here is the different meaning for the first भावना which is expressed in the first line, another word from the same causative verb भू+caus. and the participle negates the meaning related to the first and not to be taken out of context.

  

Here are the different meanings literal and literary meanings for the first word as Monier Williams gives:

भावना -

  

(H2) भावन 2 \[p= 755,1\] \[L=150349\] mf(ई)n. (fr. Caus. ; for 1. » 2. भ/आ p.750) causing to be , effecting , producing , displaying , manifesting MBh. Ka1v. BhP.

\[p= 755,1\] \[L=150350\] promoting or effecting any one's (gen. or comp.) welfare MBh. R. &c

\[p= 755,1\] \[L=150351\] ***imagining , fancying*** Asht2a1vS.

\[p= 755,1\] \[L=150352\] teaching MBh.

  

Out of context, one can apply any of these meanings to the line, and make any meaning out of the line. The highlighted meaning is interpreted in Sanskrit and English differently using different words according to the context and the same will be negated in expression अभावयतः. as the whole context is related to the mental condition and not any physical creation. This is contextual meaning. You can call it as belief, conceiving, or concentrate upon something, etc. according to you interpret the "Yoga" which is the main theme for the line and the Upanishadic philosophy as understood by the Teachers beginning from Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, and so on.

  

Now it is up to you whether you follow literal meaning out of contextor contextual meaning/interpretation. Outside the religious context too भावना is used for imagination or conception and भावयति is also used in the same meaning.

  

Here is another instance of the same causative verb:

  

देवान् भावयतानेन ते देवा भवयन्तु वः \|

परस्परं ***भावयन्तः*** श्रेयः परम् अवाप्स्यथ \|\|
