Dear list members,  

  

In looking at translations and commentaries of Bhagavad Gita verse 2.66 there are very very wide differences in how abhāvayataḥ is translated or understood. See below:

nāsti buddhir ayuktasya na cāyuktasya bhāvanā \|  
na cābhāvayataḥ śāntir aśāntasya kutaḥ sukham \|\| 2 / 66 \|\|  
  
abhāvayataḥ  
  
**One who does not entertain a belief in an ideal or has no faith.**  
P.C. Divanji - Critical word Index to the Bhagavad gita, 1945  
entry 302 page 14  
abhāvayataḥ Gen. sing. of the pres. participial adj. abhāvayat (One who does not entertain a belief in an ideal or has no faith) 2\|66  
**  
One who does not develop.**  
The Bhagavadgita by Zaehner - who says:  
"Translations have varied between **perserverance in the pursuit of knowledge** (Telang) , **inspiration** (Barnett), **conceptual ideation** (Rangacarya), **meditation** (S.) , reflection (Hill), **power of concentration** (Rk.), and **efficient-force** (Edgerton). These meanings are also assigned by the respective translators to abhāvayataḥ . Both in Sanskrit and Pali the normal meaning of bhāvaya - is 'nourish' or 'develop'. In the Gita itself (3.11) the word is used of the sacrifice to the gods. "By sacrifice man nourishes the gods and the gods in turn nourish man". The word is common in the Mbh. in the sense of "nourish" and "develop". This too is its normal meaning in Pali".

  
  
abhāvayataḥ aśraddadhataḥ (which I think means "**one who has no faith**")  
from jñānakarmasamucca commentary of ānandavardhana  

  

What is the "literal" meaning of abhāvayataḥ. In normal discourse outside of a religious context. Is it as Zaehner says where this from the present particple of the causative bhāvayant = causing to be = development, so the genitive is  bhāvayataḥ = one having development and  abhāvayataḥ = one having no development.

  

Thanks,

Harry
