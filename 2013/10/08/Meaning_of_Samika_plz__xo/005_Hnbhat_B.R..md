श्यामिका means the impurity of gold, than purity of gold.

  

SAMIKA TRADING is well known as Restaurant Business consultants that aims to provide the entire solution for restaurants for commodities and kitchen managements needs in Japan.

  

प्रसन्ना or प्रसन्न has not written in Hindi, to make any explanations possible and or even how they pronounce it is a different thing. If she/he had asked before naming, it would have been useful to suggest some meaningful name.

  

Thanks for all those who tried to explain the given name already.
