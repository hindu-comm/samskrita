I want to know the meaning of samika.

I searched a lot for 6 months to find the meaning. The one that is given in baby names list defines it as Peace. I don't know how it is related.



There is a rushi name Samika - shamika who is peace goer. So does it mean peace so? I have no idea.



In Monier Dictionary, It defined as Pike, Javelin. So if I name baby with this name does it mean she is sharp like these weapons? Or does it mean Weapon?



I am so confused.



Another research found me this Samika - a three note in our Carnatic music.

archika, gathika, samika



Ga ri Saa - this group of three notes were called saamika not samika. or is it samika?  

The beginning of saamaveda was with these notes.

The whole of samaveda is full of music samagana.  
Sama-gana( Sama- Melody, Gana - to sing) with one note is called Archika, with two notes Gathika, with three notes Saamika, with four notes swarnatara, with five notes Oudava, with six notes Shadava and with seven notes Sampurana.





So can anyone clear my confusion. I named my baby samika. I want to make sure about the meaning. Please help me find the real meaning.
