Thank you so much for this prompt response. It was very informative. But we are pronouncing her name as समिक which is why I have all this confusion.

When you write in English it is simply Samika. Everywhere in records we mentioned it that way.



According to the link below. The same samika has several meaning some of which are not appropriate for baby naming. ButI understand that thepronunciation is different as shown in the link. If possible can you write down in hindi language so that I can to understand.

Moreover what about my research? Does it make any sense to analyze it that way. or does it mean what you said.



I initially thought it was Peaceful when I googled and named her that way. But later when I kept looking it gave negative meaning. Please help me. I named her only because it has Sanskrit meaning. My in laws and my parents did not like it at all. They felt it was more like French name. I want to give them good idea.



Thanks a lot for your time. I really appreciate Sir.
