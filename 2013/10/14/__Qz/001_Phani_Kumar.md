Namaste. Vijayadasami greetings. You have given us a link to a very valuable resource indeed. Mr.Chaturvedi Badrinath's book "The Mahabharata- An enquiry in the human condition" and "The women in Mahabharata" are based mostly on this edition. I have been looking for it for quite some time. It happened on this auspicious day. Thank you,sir.
