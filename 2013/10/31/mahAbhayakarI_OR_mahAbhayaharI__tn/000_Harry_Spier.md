Dear list members,  

  

For the first half of the 10th verse of the Annapurnastotram most on-line versions have:

kṣatratrāṇakarī **mahābhayakarī** mātā kṛpāsāgarī  
sākṣānmokṣakarī sadā zivakarī vidhneśvarī śrīdharī \|

  

but a few have:

  

kṣatratrāṇakarī **mahābhayaharī** mātā kṛpāsāgarī  
sākṣānmokṣakarī sadā zivakarī vidhneśvarī śrīdharī \|

  

i.e. most have **mahābhayakarī** but a few have**** **mahābhayaharī**

  

1\) For the versions that use **mahābhayakarī**the translations I've seen translate this as **mahat + abhayakarī**, i.e. as "maker of great fearlessness". Can  **mahābhayakarī **mean mahat + abhayakarī (maker of great fearlessness) in Sanskrit or will it always/usually mean
**mahat + bhayakarī **(maker of great fear) .

  

2\) Is there any way to tell which is the more original reading
**mahābhayakarī** or**** **mahābhayaharī** . I.e. does this hymn appear in some larger text for which there is a critical edition etc.

  

Many thanks,

Harry Spier
