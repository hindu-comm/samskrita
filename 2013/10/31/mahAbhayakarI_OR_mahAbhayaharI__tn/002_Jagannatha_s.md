mahaabhayakarii has akaara-prashlesha according to some versions.(=Mahaa+Abhayakarii)



But I am thinking in this way;-



Vishnu is both Bhayakṛt and Bhayanaashana

(according to Vishnusahasranaaman verse no.102 ORI Mysore edition)



Can't we say that,  
Annapuurnaa isnot only kṣatratrāṇakarī and kṛpāsāgarī but also mahābhayakarī ?
