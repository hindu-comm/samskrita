I think there is no way to decide the original reading, as there is not any critical edition of this particular Stotra. Both are correct, according to which you can split महा+अभय\* great fearlesness (?), or महा-भय\* - great feat.

  

\[1\] अभय / अ-भय mf( आ )n. unfearful , not dangerous , secure \[#11439\] \[Img:60,3\]

  

\[2\] अभय / अ-भय mfn. fearless , undaunted S3Br. xiv \[#11440\] \[Img:60,3\]

  

  

As it is clear, the cause of variation is clear. That is all can be said.
