Sirs,



I also feel just as bhayakrt is creating fear in the minds of enemy (is a terror) and bhayanasana: assuring the devotee 'fear not', mahabhayakaree should intend 'creating great fear in the minds of enemy'. I recollect another version with the words 'varabnhayakari' - abhaya, varada hasta.



With respects to all

R Subrahmanian
