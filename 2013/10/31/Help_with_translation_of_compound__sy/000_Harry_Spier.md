Dear list members,  

  

How would this compound candrāṁśubimbādharī from the Annapūrṇastotram be translated.

In particular its the last part bimbādharī I'm not clear about. Whether this means something like "whose lower lip is red like the bimba fruit" or "who bears the disk \[of the moon\]".

  

Any help would be appreciated.

  

Thanks,

Harry
