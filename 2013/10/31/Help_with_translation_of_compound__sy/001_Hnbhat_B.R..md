Good question. Another question, how do you translate the whole compound.

  

चन्द्रांशु-बिम्बाधरी - you will have to translate, 

चन्द्रांशु-बिम्ब-अधरी and not चन्द्रांशु-बिम्ब-धरी  

  

If you have to split at all, having चन्द्रांशुबिम्ब - it does not give the disk of moon, for which चन्द्रबिम्ब would suffice, and with अंशु, rays of moon you cannot have any specific meaning, than going round about to mean the disk of the moon with rays or the like. and having the lips. Nobody can be without lips and there is no need to mention or qualify any one as having lips alone. So one having the rays of moon, and lips like बिम्ब fruits. and चन्द्रांशु does not mean the disk of the moon generally.

  

I too do not have any idea how the compound is to be translated as a single compound, some one has translated as "whose red lips (for बिम्बाधर free translaion reddish like बिम्ब fruits) (and) shining (like) the rays of the moon". This translation from via Russian language by Google and hence I modified to be closer in meaning to the compound).
