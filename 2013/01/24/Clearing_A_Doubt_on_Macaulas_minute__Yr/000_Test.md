I wish to write a few words related to Macaulay's minutes.  
  
India has come a long way since Macaulay's minutes and independence  
from the British. It would not be correct to attribute India's  
development mainly to its adapting the English language. Take the  
examples of China, Japan, Israel and other European countries whose  
primary language is not English. They show it is not necessary to be  
proficient in English to succeed economically for example. The real  
intentions of Macaulay's minutes and subsequent actions were not  
clearly to benefit Indians, but the present benefit could have been a  
desirable side effect of it.  
  
Here is an example showing technical progress made in ancient India in  
the form of a Sanskrit book written by sage Bharadwaja, the English  
translation of which can be found here:

I dont need to mention the value of Yoga shastra to the present world.  
  
Macaulay might have promoted the English language and culture in India  
causing many favourable side effects, but whether changing the course  
of a culture, that had systems standardised over several thousands of  
years and so rich in knowledge of things which are considered  
extremely valuable even today was a major historical mistake - only  
time will tell.  
  
With respects
