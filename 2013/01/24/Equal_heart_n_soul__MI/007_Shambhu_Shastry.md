dhanyavaad Anilkumar mahodaya.  
  
Very true, all the Vaidikapaddhatis flowing from these sootras, and therefore the ritual practices I am aware of, are as such. I did so for my own marriage. My father as purohita conducted countless such marriages. My brother and uncle do. That is the system now.  
  
Nonetheless, the examination of Rigveda 10-85 depicts role reversal, and much degradation, in the current ArSa vivAha ritual practice (and in all other rituals too). Since Vyasa mahaashaya and scholars of his time compiled the Vedas, the Rishi-chchandas-devata vichaara for each rik, and the mantra viniyoga assignments, I wonder if the practice till then wasn't so. We can only guess.  
  
Much has been lost, and the most ancient tree is struggling to stay alive. Anyway, correction should start from my abode: I am teaching sandhyaavandanaa and Veda mantras to my two daughters.  
  
Pray a new Vasishta will fix things up.
