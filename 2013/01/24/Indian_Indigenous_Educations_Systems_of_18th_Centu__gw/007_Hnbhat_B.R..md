For the study of Veda-s by ब्राह्मण-s (not by Shudras or others, obligatorily) महाभाष्य attests the following in the पस्पशाह्निक:

  

(प-३; अकि-१,१.१४-२.२; रो-१,८-१४; भा-६/१७) आगमः खलु अपि ।

**(प-३; अकि-१,१.१४-२.२; रो-१,८-१४; भा-७/१७) ब्राह्मणेन निष्कारणः धर्मः षडङ्गः वेदः अध्येयः ज्ञेयः इति ।**

(प-३; अकि-१,१.१४-२.२; रो-१,८-१४; भा-८/१७) प्रधानम् च षट्सु अङ्गेषु व्याकरणम् ।

(प-३; अकि-१,१.१४-२.२; रो-१,८-१४; भा-९/१७) प्रधाने च कृतः यत्नः फलवान् भवति ।

  

And for the mention of any female Grammarians, I would like to get any reference from Yudhishthir Mimamsaka-s History of Sanskrit Grammar or Belwalkar's Sanskrit Grammar, both are authentic, than mere mention of Patanjali, to Mahabhashya.

  

The above reference quoted only attests the study of Veda by Brahmana obligatory and according to smriti- text,and Dharmashastra texts, only Brahmana is authorized both to learn and teach Veda-s and other two VarNa-s are only entitled to learning Veda-s. No discussion on admission of female students or any prohibition to the learning of Veda-s by women, is found. But it is alltogether ignored in the contexts. Brahmana was described as having six duties:

  

विप्रश्च ब्राह्मणोऽसौ*षट्कर्मा*यागादिभिर्वृतः ( २. ६. ८१६)

  

by Amara in his synonyms of Brahmana in the above reference. The six include यजन, याजन, दान-प्रतिग्रह, and अध्ययन-अध्यापन - three sets, for all the six only Brahmana is obliged to attend. Others of traivarnika-s,
Here is the record of Arthashastra by Chanakya at his time:

  

  
एष त्रयी-धर्मश्चतुर्णां वर्णानां आश्रमाणां च स्व-धर्म-स्थापनादौपकारिकः ।। ०१.३.०४ ।।

  

स्वधर्मो ब्राह्मणस्य अध्ययनं अध्यापनं यजनं याजनं दानं प्रतिग्रहश्च ।। ०१.३.०५ ।।

  

क्षत्रियस्याध्ययनं यजनं दानं शस्त्र-आजीवो भूत-रक्षणं च ।। ०१.३.०६ ।।

  

वैश्यस्याध्ययनं यजनं दानं कृषि-पाशुपाल्ये वणिज्या च ।। ०१.३.०७ ।।

  

शूद्रस्य द्विजाति-शुश्रूषा वार्त्ता कारु-कुशीलव-कर्म च ।। ०१.३.०८ ।।

  
As it is clear, शूद्र’s धर्म doesn't include any of the three sets meant for the त्रैवर्णिक-s. This picture cannot be turned aside by the census record in 1825 AD.

  

This is just to show the system of caste based education, which has neither the Mecaulay or his Imperialistic system of Education did not have anything to to deny the lower caste the Education or promote Education as the purpose of this topic seems to object. The above is the picture we get from the record of Arthashastra, if we accept it as an authentic recording of the law at the time of Chanakya. This continued from the time Amara had written his lexicon including षट्कर्मा as the synonym of ब्राह्मण, by whose time it was already established as his duties much earlier than his time.

  

And for the records of Balambhatti, and Mitakshara, I would like to have the precise reference where the commentary is offered. The context only can decide whether it supports the learning of Veda-s by women or not. Without the context, one cannot decide by quoting a running translation.
