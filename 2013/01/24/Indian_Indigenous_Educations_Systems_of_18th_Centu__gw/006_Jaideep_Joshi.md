Thanks Dr. Bhat Mahodaya for pointing out the following typo:

  
  
"3. Both Mitakshara and Balambhatti mention sadyovadhus and brahmacharinis, both are obviously after manusmriti:"  

It should be Brahmavadinis.  
  

Also, the point on women grammarians was mentioned by someone in a previous thread, but I could not verify it. Can someone post the reference?  
  

Regards,  

Jaideep.
