I just want to clarify one point made by Arvind Mahodaya, as think you may not have fully understood it.



* "I would not place any great stress on the so-called statistical tables in it because Statistics - and gathering unbiased raw data as a science - was unknown to the people who collected that data."*

**

What is meant by this is the science of statistics was unknown at this time - ie the factors which give rise to errors and biases in the results. Unless the methodology is rigorous it may not be possible to interpret the data. For example what was the question asked, was the wording the same everytime - how was it asked; were people paid to produce answers; who was asked - was it teachers or was it parents (same in all areas) , was their any coersion in the answers, who was doing the asking? was it a superior of inferior person, what was the sample size in each area, what was the ratio of response rate to sample size. Are the data across areas directly comparable; was there independent corroboration, what was the premis being tested, was the sample size valid to get a meaningful result, was the question in the form so only a yes or no answer is given, etc. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_methodology> for further information. This information is not given in TBT.
