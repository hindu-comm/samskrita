It is true that at some point the "factory model" of producing people with skills would be required to benefit (in the sense of increased mostly-material prosperity) from the industrial-revolution-spurred economy. There is no reason why Indians would not have responded to economic incentives on their own, in their own way - as many other unequal East Asian societies eventually did. The "enlightenment" delivered by our former rulers reminds me of [the Borg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyenRCJ_4Ww) more than anything else.  

  

That said, I have heard modern educators who find this system of force-feeding mathematics or whatever to uninterested kids abhorrent and a killer of creativity - see talks by [Ken Robinson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY) for example. They argue that this factory system is not necessarily as great as it is cracked up to be.
