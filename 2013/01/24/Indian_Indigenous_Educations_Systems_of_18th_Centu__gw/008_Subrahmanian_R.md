Dear Scholars,



On the subject of Indian education system, particularly women education, I may be permitted to quote a few lines from 'A History of South India' by Sri K.A. Nilakanta Sastri in the Chapter on 'Social and Economic Conditions': "The Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle (1623) has left a vivid account of the village schools and the methods of instruction they followed including the process of learning by rote and the use of fine sand strewn on the floor for writing, methods which survived in full till the other day and have perhaps not quite gone out yet in remote villages. Ibn Batuta (1333-45) records"I saw in Hanaur thirteen schools for the instruction of girls, and twenty three for boys, a thing I have not seen anywhere else"



With reverence to all

R Subrahmanian
