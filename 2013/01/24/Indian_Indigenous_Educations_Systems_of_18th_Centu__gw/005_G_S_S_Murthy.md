A short addendum for what it iis worth: During nineteenforties when I was a school boy,  
my father would talk of what is called in Kannada," koolie maTha", which was a one-teacher primary school where village boys learnt elements of 3R.  

The teacher was paid in cash/kind through voluntary contribution by the villagers. The teacher was more often than not a Brahmin, belonging to th  

a village where Brahmins lived(Agrahara).  

Regards,  

Murthy
