Pranaam Ramakrishnan Mahodaya!  
  

Elementary schools were certainly in vernacular languages. Very few were in Sanskrit. It is unlikely that Sanskrit was a spoken language on a large scale during 18th century. Higher learning schools, however, were probably Sanskrit medium. Even in these, there was representation of many castes and not Brahmins alone.  
  

I had also read somewhere (although I cant recall the reference) that adhyayan of Vedas was actively discouraged by British, and only Shastras were allowed to be taught. Medicine was also discouraged. For eg, there is recorded evidence (see Dharampal Collected writings, Vol 1) that inoculation of smallpox was done traditionally by a sect of Brahmins, but that was discouraged by British because they wanted to promote European vaccines.
