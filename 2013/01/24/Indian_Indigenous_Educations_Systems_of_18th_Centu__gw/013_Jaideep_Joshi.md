Vimala Mahodaye,  
  

I understood very well what Arvindji meant. My point was that can we find a single record in history, which qualifies the survey method you describe? And yet, we put all our faith on such records to create our history, and even believe firmly in it. (See how entire Indian chronology is based on a SINGLE identification of sandrocottus with chandragupta maurya! - A truely scientific method indeed!!) Nonetheless, the volume of data is TBT is far more voluminous than these scant references scattered around elsewhere. Yes, there could be biases in it, but are any historical records free from biases? Moreover, considering that these records were created not by "Hindu nationalists" or "Europenan romanticists", but by administrative collectors, more likely than not, the bias can be expected to be the other way round, i.e. the system was probably even better than TBT says!  
  

Arvind Mahodaya,  
  

Education has never been a formal state-dependent excercise until the British rule. However, your mail insists that what is not state funded is necessarily of a lower grade, informal, almost useless. I will reply to this soon, from Dharampal's other volumes, which give data on how these systems were funded, how instruction happened, etc.  
  

Regards,  

Jaideep.
