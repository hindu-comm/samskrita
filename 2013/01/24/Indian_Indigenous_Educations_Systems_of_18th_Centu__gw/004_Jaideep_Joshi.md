Pranaam Vimala Mahodaye!  

  

Dharampal himself urged that his works be reviewed academically. Our intellectuals, for the last 60 years, have resorted to neglecting work that makes their theories uncomfortable. The same was done with Dharampal, K.D. Sethna, Kota Venkatachelam, and with so many others. Once the challenging authors die, status quo (i.e. the colonial views on India) is resumed.  
  

However, there has indeed been scholarly a review of the books by [Claude Alvares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Alvares). (See the preface of the attached pdf called "Making History". The pdf is vol I of the collected writings which is on Science and Technology of the 18th century). There also exists a Dharampal Chair at one university (ill get the info soon, though I heard it has been vacant for many years out of neglect by academia).  
  

Scepticism is always welcome, but it MUST BE informed. One has to take pains to go into the archives and produce conuter-evidence in order to qualify for commenting. The archives are available to this day in England and in Chennai. Dharampal chair was set up precisely to study them in greater depth. For now, the data is in front of you, and at least for the Madras presidency, the data is detailed and irrefutable. (Incidentally, it is the Tamil schools which come out as best examples of education for all, equality etc, and ironically, it is the same state that believes that its people were oppressed for millennia)  

  

PS: All of Dharampal's writings are available [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/29011033/Dharampal-s-Collected-Writings-Vol-1-5).  

  
Regards,
