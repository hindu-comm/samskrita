Of late, I am observing that Samskrit mailing list is slowly getting converted into a dustbin of all sorts of non-Samskrit-related discussions in english.  
  
What does any of this discussion have to do with Samskrit?  
If people would like to debate about such topics, why don't they write in Samskrit? At least those who are reading will get the practice of understanding Samskrit language, whatever the subject matter?  
Keep this simple rule in mind when posting stuff to this mailing list - "In Samskrit, or On Samskrit".  
- Sai.
