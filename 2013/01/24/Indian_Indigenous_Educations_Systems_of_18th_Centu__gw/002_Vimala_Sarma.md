Thank you Joshi Mahodaya.

I did a bit of a search and much of the book, Beautiful Tree is available as PDF file; See <http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/beautifultree.pdf>

There is nevertheless a lot of scepticism in some circles - including academic circles. Can you please tell me if there are scholarly reviews of the book?
