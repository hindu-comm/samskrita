Namaste!  
  

For those who replied before Arvind Mahodaya, the discussion is once again simply centering on study of Vedas, perhaps simply because that is the only "study" that you find mentioned in the old Sanskrit texts. No doubt, study of Vedas was disallowed to Shudras, and this is evident from the statistics in TBT also, where Veda and Law shows only Brahmin students. My clinching argument was, in fact, for the other sciences like Astronomy, Medicine and for Elementary school, which had more of a practical and moral educational basis.  
  

**Now Arvindji's post merits a more detailed reply**.  
  

Before that, I would reiterate my request to keep mails short and pointed. There is great chance to miss many things in long mails. And the replies continue to grow even longer.  

  
The period which TBT quotes is mostly from around 1825:  
"Although the Madras Presidency data which forms the bulk of this book was collected during 1822-25, the educational system to which the data pertained was much older. It was still the dominant system during the 18th century, after which it started decaying very rapidly. The Adam Reports reflect that decline in the fourth decade of the 19th century."  
  

Incidentally, this is also the period when reformers like Mahatma Phule were active (his first book came in 1855), and the society that they saw, clearly had already lost its indigenous education systems. In fact, even in 1825, the indigenous systems were already in a state of decay\* following [Bentinck's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_William_Bentinck) measures of "reforming the court system, \[and making\] English, rather than Persian, the language of the higher courts and encourag\[ing\] western-style education for Indians in order to provide more educated Indians for service in the British bureaucracy." (see wiki link above).  

\* TBT, pp 20: "School attendance, especially in the districts of the Madras Presidency, *even in the decayed state of the period 1822-25*, was proportionately far higher than the numbers in all variety of schools in England in 1800."  
  

Arvindji, you say  

* "I would not place any great stress on the so-called statistical tables in it because Statistics - and gathering unbiased raw data as a science - was unknown to the people who collected that data."  
*

 Can you prove that what the data shows is wrong? Can you prove that there were only Brahmins in all the schools listed in the data, in spite of the explicit numbers mentioned? For that, one will have to go into the archives once again, and show either of the following:  

1\) that every single table, every single number in TBT is wrong, and it was the author's mistake  

2\) that there are no such records in the archives and that the author has fabricated all this data  

 Without that, there is no basis for such a statement.  

 True, there were no exact statistical methods to collect data during that time. But nowhere does history rely on statistics. If historians trash accounts of indigenous education claiming lack of statistics, why dont I see the same historians trashing Al'Beruni's or Megasthenes' or Greek records in Indian history? Why dont they also trash anecdotal references to lack of education in the scriptures, by the same logic?  

  
  

Now there is a lot to refute in your last paragraph.

  
* "There is a vast body of autobiographical, anecdotal and word-of-mouth evidence that says that education, in whatever quality it was available, was almost entirely the preserve of the upper classes. "  
*

 Firstly, most these anecdotes, autobiographies, etc, while perfectly true, are from a period after the 1860s, much posterior to the total decay of indigenous systems.  
 It does not take many generations to forget the past, especially when it is actively discouraged. Two examples:  
 1) How many youngsters from today's generation know Panchatantra, a thing that was so common to even my parents' generation?  
 2) The simple home-made remedies that my mother knows are totally unknown in my generation.  
 The rate at which knowledge dies is indeed frightening. (PS: I would not have used the word "classes". It means a totally different thing.) Thus this later literature cannot serve as evidence for times several generations past.

  
  
* Why do we ignore that and put all our trust in 'Beautiful Tree', a book generally unknown even to the most ardent believers that everything In India was good before the British came and spoiled it?  
*

   One does not judge a book on how many people know it, but by its content. We ought to "trust" it because it presents perfectly [falsifiable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) data, (that too, collected by those who had vested interests in collecting it.) If one wants to prove it wrong, I have already outlined what one needs to do. That is the only [scientific](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) way. (see the links also). To Hinduism's great misfortune these "ardent believers" typically have no clue about the contents of *any* texts/records.  

  
 *Had conditions been as rosy as painted in it, there would have been no need for Phule, Karve and Ambedkar and their life-long struggles.
Were they fighting imaginary ghosts?"*  

 No, they were fighting real issues, issues generated not by the native system, but by *absence* of it. Sadly, many of these reformers did not have this data at their disposal (these would have been confidential british govt papers back then), otherwise i'm sure they would've taken a different stand. All they had to refer to was old texts, esp. smritis, and that way their stand was justified back then. Moreover, conditions painted in TBT are not as "rosy" as you make it sound. There is no denying that there were problems of the time, but not of the nature and scale that is believed.
