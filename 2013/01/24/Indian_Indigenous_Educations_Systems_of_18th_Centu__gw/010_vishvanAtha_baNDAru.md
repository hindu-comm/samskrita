Dear Shri Arvindji,  
  

I am unable to resist adding my bit of rhetoric :).  
  

You asked a question -  
  
 *Why do we ignore that and put all our trust in 'Beautiful Tree',*  
  

By the same token, why should we put all our trust in the data from Poona college, which you your self state *that has been a bastion of traditional Brahminical learning in Maharashtra. ?  
  
*

You have also stated the following in another thread called 'Clearing A Doubt on Macaula's 'minute' about this very same Poona college just few days back (Emphasis and underlining mine) -  
  

> *After the replacement of the Peshwa rule by the British, the annual > distribution of Dakshina was stopped and replaced by the establishment > of a college called the Hindu College in 1821.

So, if this specific college is open only to Brahman students, why are you giving the data from it to refute the data from Beautiful Tree that claims lower casts were part of educational system ?  
  

Sorry for being personal in this email, but it doesn't sound correct to me that data is being mus-represented here.
