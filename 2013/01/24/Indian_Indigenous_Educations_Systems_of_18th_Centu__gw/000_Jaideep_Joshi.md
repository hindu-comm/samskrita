Subject: Fwd: Indian Indigenous Educations Systems of 18th Century  
To: Jaideep Joshi \<[jaide...@gmail.com]()\>  
  
  

  

Namaskaar,  
  

Following Nareshji's suggestion, im starting a separate thread on India's native education systems to debate and settle this issue once and for all (at least within this group).  
  

Two lines of argument are pursued by two sets of scholars in this regards. Let me first list down their main postulates.  
  

**P) The popular-academic and largely believed view:**  

1\) Education consisted of memorising the Vedas and shastras  

2\) Education happened in Sanskrit  

3\) only Brahmins had access to education  

4\) education lacked practicality  

5\) education was disallowed for women after Manu-smriti. The Vedic period however, was "secular" in that we have examples of women Rishis  

6\) British education was a great benefit for India  

  

*evidence quoted (numbered by postulate):*  

1-4) none  

5\) references from Manusmriti  

6\) McCauley’s minutes?  

  

**N) The "Indian nationalistic" view which wants to challenge the above view:**  
1) Education happened via the gurushishya mode in gurukuls  

2\) Education happened in Sanskrit  

3\) British education was responsible for death of Sanskrit  

4\) education was open for women (only Gargi/Maitreyi quoted as evidence )  

  

*evidence quoted (numbered by postulate):*  

1-2) references in old texts  

3\) none  

4\) references from very old texts  

  

Now it turns our that data shows quite a different picture from either of these.  
  
**D) The postulates from the evidence that I shall quote shortly are as follows:**  

1\) Education was open to all, even so called Chandalas. The British had a negative role to play, if at all, in the education of the "lower" castes.  

2\) Education happened in native languages, very few schools were in Sanskrit  

3\) Large number of schools were free of cost  

4\) schools did not necessarily operate in a gurukul mode: i.e. they had class timings etc much like today's schools  

5\) Education was (at least in principle) open to women, and even Muslim women attended the schools. Women even learned Vedas and Shastras, though to a lesser degree  

6\) Numbers of women in schools were low, possibly because most women received education at home.  

7\) education did not consist of rote learning of Vedas and shastras  

8\) Shudras in fact dominated even in higher sciences like astronomy and Medicine, (except Vedas, whicih were exclusive to Brahmins)  

9\) the general pattern of education was similar throughout India, though detailed data is currently available only for some presidencies .  

10\) Britain, in fact, got the idea of education for all from India  

  

*Now coming to evidence for each of the above postulates.*  
  

A lot has been quoted from very old sources, so I will mainly quote 2 sources, both of which are from colonial period: 1) The Beautiful Tree 2) Balambhatti  

  
Since no one seems to have read "The Beautiful Tree", I am forced to reproduce content from it here, along with a note on what the book is all about.  
  

**Beautiful Tree**: When British administrators surveyed India (for whatever purposes), they sent letters to England describing the native systems. Many of these letters included detailed data. These letters are available to this day in archives of Chennai and England. Dharampal, after analysing a few of these letters for 10 yrs, summarized the data in a book called "The Beautiful Tree". Chapters 1,2,3 are an absolute must read as they set the context of British activities in India as well as Europe during this period.  

  

**Balambhatti**: This is a commentary on the Mitakshara (11th century) which is a commentary on the Yajnavalkya smriti, written in the 18th century by Balambhatta Payagunde. (A period during which, as is commonly believed, India was neck deep in social injustice, primitiveness, stagnation etc., from which Britishers are supposed to have rescued her.)  

  

*Evidence (numbered by postulates)*  
  

**1)** "In his first report, \[William Adam\] observed that there exist about 1,00,000 village schools in Bengal and Bihar around the 1830s" (TBT, pp18)  
  

In various provinces, from Oriya speaking to Tamil speaking, there were total \>1.6 lakh students int \~16000 schools and colleges, where total population was \~ 128 lakhs. (TBT, pp24,25)  
  

Here is the caste-wise composition of students in schools from various provinces. (TBT, pp 28)

*According to William Adam's report:*  
"It is true that the greater proportion of the teachers came from the Kayasthas, Brahmins, Sadgop and Aguri castes. Yet, quite a number came from 30 other caste groups also, and **even the Chandals had 6 teachers.** The elementary school students present an even greater variety, and it seems as if *every caste group is represented in the student population, the Brahmins and the Kayasthas nowhere forming more than 40%* of the total. In the two Bihar districts, together they formed no more than 15 to 16%. The more surprising figure is of **61 Dom, and 61 Chandal school students in the district of Burdwan, nearly equal to the number of Vaidya students, 126, in that district. ** *While **Burdwan had 13 missionary schools, the number of Dom and Chandal scholars in them were only four**; and, as Adam mentioned, only 86 of the ‘scholars belonging to 16 of the lowest castes’ were in these missionary schools, while 674 scholars from them were in the ‘native schools’.

**2)** Most schools were not in Sanskrit, but in native languages: TBT, pp. 29

**5, 8)** TBT**,** pp 40 (I would say that this is the most impressive table in the book)**

TBT, pp 43: Among Shudras, the girls to boys ratio was in fact higher, which I find very counter-intuitive  
  

  

**7)** TBT, pp 32

Also, there are sufficient references to refute P.5, that women education stopped since the compilation of the Manusmriti:  
  

1\. Judge in Sankara-Mandana debate was Mandana Mishra's wife, which was very much after the Manusmriti's compilation  
  

2\. Data shows that women were present in elementary schools as well as in advanced schools, and even in Veda study, though in limited numbers. This shows that there was no "law" banning education of women.  
  

3\. Both Mitakshara and Balambhatti mention sadyovadhus and brahmacharinis, both are obviously after manusmriti:  
  
*Balambhatti:* "If it be said, that a girl not married and so not passing through the sacrament, cannot go to heaven, to this we reply, that a girl may pass her whole life in study after getting the sacred thread, and thus become a Brahmavadini, a knower of Brahman, and thus go to heaven. Ordinary women must pass through the formality of the sacrament of marriage in order to go to heaven, but not so the Brahmavadinis."  
  

4\. Patanjali, who mentions women grammarians, is post manu-smriti even by modern chronology  

  
  
  

I beg pardon for this really long mail. But I hope it contributes towards clearing the dust on this issue. If anyone wants to support/ refute anything in this thread, please take it up point by point, and make precise and reference-backed statements.  

  

Pranaam,
