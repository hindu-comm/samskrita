This is a basic need for understanding Sanskrit. First one has to familiarize with the declined forms of nouns and verbs enough to be able to identify the case-ending and the stem of the nouns and their relative विभक्ति-s. Then only one can look into the dictionary for the stem part, as any general user of Sanskrit Dictionary would do. Otherwise, just like looking into English dictionaries, which are compiled in different methods, Sanskrit Dictionaries are also organized in different methods. Some may give some special/irregular forms or one may give all the inflected forms or suggest some rules, depending on the dictionary makers choice. Here is a topic discussed how to read the dictionaries meant how to use the dictionaries long ago in this group:

And lastly, it is not enough to cover some selected portions in readers and then go on reading primary texts, to increase vocabulary like English language. Sanskrit Language has a different complicated structure, which makes it a need to cover major topics in grammar, or cover some Standard Readers like Bhandarkar's Reader I, II, or MR Kales Higher Grammar, enough to identify the stem and the suffixes, or at least identify the विभक्ति and लकार or tenses to get the meaning, apart from the dictionaries, which help to certain extent some irregular forms to those who already know the grammar and structure. Apte's Students' Guide is also available on line, which gives training in both structure and grammar.

  

Hope this will help in a way.
