Nitish,  
  

You have hit upon a common difficulty faced by beginners when looking up words in a dictionary. As you know, words are used with their vibhakti-pratyayas. And the dictionary only gives the shabda itself without adding vibhakti-pratyayas. In this case, saMpUrNatA is the shabda. Now, you may not find this shabda in some dictionaries because it is derived from sampUrNa.  
  

So what is the way out?  

\(a\) Familiarize yourself with various vibhati forms with any practice book.  

\(b\) If you are using MW dictionary online, you could do a prefix search and type in the first few characters, e.g., search for sampurna or sampu and so on. Depending on which online interface you use, you may have to adjust the number of query results returned.  
  

I'll let you figure out which vibhakti etc. saMpUrNatayA has.
