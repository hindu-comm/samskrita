namaste,



I have written a transliterator, and played with many transliterators. I primarily use Google Input Tools to type directly into all unicode aware applications.



You can download the input tools for Sanskrit from <http://www.google.com/inputtools/windows/index.html>, and the full feature list is available at <http://www.google.com/inputtools/windows/features.html>



You can also use this with the input scheme of your choice, using "canonical mode". For example, I have a custom schema file with itrans mappings, available from <http://www.aupasana.com/file-cabinet/itrans.scm>



To use the itrans bindings, put the .scm file inC:\\Program Files\\Google\\Google Sanskrit Input\\Schemes, restart the IME, and enter canonical mode (Ctrl-M).



You can add scheme rules for custom codepoints, and type with the Chandas etc fonts with vedic accents.



sasneham,



 ajit
