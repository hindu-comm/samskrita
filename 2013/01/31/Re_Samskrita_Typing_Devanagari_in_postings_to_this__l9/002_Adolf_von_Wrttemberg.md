Arvind Jii,

We’ve used the following देवनागरी typing software for the last few years:

<http://www.mywhatever.com/sanskrit/vidyut/>

Nota bene: it is WINDOWS ONLY and completely compatible with g-mail, Hotmail, all versions of MS Word (2003 – 2013), Notepad, WordPad, Windows XP to Windows 8 इत्यादि ।

Please e-mail me if you have any follow-up questions,

विष्णुः

[Wolf...@bellsouth.net]()

P.S. You type देवनागरी directly into the application. There is no cutting and pasting!
