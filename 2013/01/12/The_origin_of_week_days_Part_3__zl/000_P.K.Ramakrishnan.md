Week days – Part 3





The origin of weekdays

given in Aryabahtiyam.



भानामध: शनैश्चर-

सुरगुरु-भौमा-र्क-शुक्र-बुध-चन्द्रा: /

तेषामधश्च भूमि:

मेधीभूता ख-मध्यस्था //



सप्तैते होरेशा:

शनैस्चराद्या यथाक्रमं शीघ्रा: /

शीघ्रक्रमात् चयुर्था

भवन्ति सूर्योद्य़ाद् दिनपा: //



In the sky at a remote distance lie the stars.



Under them Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus

Mercury and Moon move.



Under these the earth remains in the sky as a post.



These seven planets are the lords of each hour arranged according to

their speed, the slowest one first and the fastest one the last. When there are 24 horas or hours in a day and night. The lord of the first day

is Saturn at sunrise. Then the fourth becomes the lord of the first hour at sunrise on the next day.



The day is named after the lord of the first hour.



So the week days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

The Christians changed the first day to Sunday.



Hora is a Greek word from which hour in English has come.



The difference in the arrangement of planets and week days is

because there are 24 hours in a day which is not divisible by 7

being the number of planets.
