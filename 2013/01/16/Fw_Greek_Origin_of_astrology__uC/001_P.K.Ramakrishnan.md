Sri Srinivasan is arguing on words which are not relevant to the point.

  

Mlecchah - Generally a non-aryan

  

गोमाम्सखादको यस्तु

विरूद्धं बहु भाषते /

सर्वाचारविहीनश्च

म्लेच्छ इत्यभिधीयते //

  

Apte's dictionary says

यवन means Greek.

  

म्लेच्छा हि यवना: means. The Greeks verily areuncivilized.

तेषु सम्यक् शास्त्रं इदं स्थितम् = In them this knowledge (astrology) is well established.

ऋषिवत् ते०पि पूज्यन्ते - Even then they arehonoredlike Rishis.

किं पुनः = what then

दैव-वित् द्विज: = if a Brahmin knows astrology.

  

You haveinterpretedthis to mean that the Greeks learnt this from the Indians.

  

This is called kutarkam.

  

I will not post anything more on this topic..

My mail was about your arguments on the Greek origin of astrology. You've not answered it. I'd listed out my arguments clearly. You've not answered any of them. If you think considering Jyothisham as Vendangam is not correct. Alright, agreed. And we can even discuss that separately. I know very well the difference of astrology and astronomy. And all your silly arguments like Joshi becoming Jyothishi etc can be discussed at a later time. There was no issue about any of these things. The main issue was quite different which you have not addressed. You're just beating about the bush.
