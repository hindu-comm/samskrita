The following has been said in the classic published in 1896 'भारतीय ज्योति:शास्त्राचा इतिहास' (History of Indian Astronomy) by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit regarding the origin of the concept and nomenclatures of week-days. I give a synopsis thereof.

  

The word ’होरा’ is neither in the Vedas or in any book of the Vedanga period. It is originally not a Sanskrit word and originates in Chaldia as the 24th part of the day, from where the Greeks borrowed it as ώρα, and that, in turn became ’होरा’ in Sanskrit and 'hour' in English. (MW too gives the same etymology.)

  

In Indian Astronomy each hour of the day is associated with a ’होरेश’ and the ’होरेश’s follow each other in the sequence of शनि, गुरु, मंगळ, रवि, शुक्र, बुध and चंद्र (सोम), which is the order in which these are arranged by the lengths of their respective भगणs, that is, the time taken by each to complete one revolution through stars, as observed from the Earth. The day carries the name of that planet which is the first ’होरेश’ of that day. In 24 hours there will be three cycles of 7 ’होरेश’s and three more ’होरेश’s. Thus, if Day 1 has शनि as the ’होरेश’, i.e., it is शनिवार, the next day, Day 2, will begin with रवि as the ’होरेश’. That day will be रविवार, and so on.

  

सूर्यसिद्धान्त भूगोलाध्याय lays this down in the following verse:

  

मन्दादध: क्रमेण स्युश्चतुर्था दिवसाधिपा:।

होरेशा: सूर्यतनयादधोधः क्रमशस्तथा॥
