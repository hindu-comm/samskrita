Neither Ramakrishnan quoted any reference to Varaha Mihira's text from where he quoted his verses nor Prabhakaran has given any verse or even text reference to Yajnavalkya Smriti he claims to have mentioned week days.

  

  

Each clinging to their arguments to prove their claims without any verifiable reference to their sources, and is not desirable development in any discussion of valid information which had been discussed in other sites or works for long, like the History of Astrology, Greek Origin of Indian astronomy/astrology with reference to the original texts or books from where they quote. One can search in Google and find many research articles on the topics and here we are simply flashing words.
