Dear Arvind,

First, thank you for an informative post!

The Greek word you cited has a spelling error; it lacks the rough breathing mark which creates the **ह**-sound before a vowel. Here is the correct spelling: **ὥρα**.

Thanks again for your interesting questions and posts,

विष्णुः



One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It is simply too painful to acknowledge -- even to ourselves -- that we've been so credulous: **Carl Sagan (1934 – 1996)**

The following has been said in the classic published in 1896 'भारतीय ज्योति:शास्त्राचा इतिहास' (History of Indian Astronomy) by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit regarding the origin of the concept and nomenclatures of week-days. I give a synopsis thereof.
