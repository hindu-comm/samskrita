Respected Bhat Sir,  
Thank you very much. My doubt no longer remains.  
मे = मम वचनात् उच्यमानं makes it amply clear. And सन् सन्तौ सन्तः makes it clear that it is the masculine nominative plural of the shatṛ form of as asti. In both cases, I was perhaps carried away by ISKCON gita's translation as 'from me' for मे and 'devotees' for सन्तः \|  
Thanks and regards...Shreyas
