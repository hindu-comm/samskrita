Thank you very much Respected Bhat Sir. I was almost running away with a 'different' view of ISKCON Gita.

And सन् सन्तौ सन्तः makes it clear that it is the masculine nominative plural of the shatṛ form of as asti. In both cases, I was perhaps carried away by ISKCON gita's translation as 'from me' for मे and 'devotees' for सन्तः \|  
  
  
  
  
For the meanings of the word I have given the verse from Bhagavadgita itself. The meaning given by THE translation is comprehensive. The word सत् conveys more than a simple present participle, in Sanskrit Literature and especially in Bhagavadgita and allied philosophyical Literature.  
  
  
तं सन्तः श्रोतुमर्हन्ति सदसद्व्यक्तिहेतवः - gives the three shades of meaning of the participle. For more I have produced the lexical entry
of शब्दकल्पद्रुमः -  
  
  
  
  

and the devotees, in the translation has got the wider comprehension of "sat" as per the Bhagavadgita and not to be taken in isolation.
