I did some study in Balamanorama & Thathvabodhini, I got some  
information regarding this, A sadrusatama (similar) letter is alone  
allowed in an Adesha. The similarity is four fold:

1\. sthana - from where the sound originates (thalu etc).  
2. artha  
3. guna - means the praytna (effort) to pronounce the sound  
4. pramaana - the time to pronounce ekamatra, dvimatra etc

Example of sthanakruta sadrusyam:  
दध्यत्र. The इ-कार originates from thalu. Hence the ya-kara becomes  
the similar letter  
as ya-kara also originates from thalu.

Example of arthakruta sadrusyam:  
तृजवत्क्रोष्टु - I did not understand this, the commentary goes like  
this:  
इति क्रोष्टुशब्दस्य उकारान्तस्य तृजन्त आदेशो भवन् अर्थसाम्यात्  
क्रोष्टुशब्द: एव तृजन्त आदेशो भवति \|

Example of gunakruta sadrusyam:  
वाग्घरि: - Here the effort to pronounce ह-कार: is घोष नाद संवार  
महाप्राण. For this the similar letter is घ-कार as that also requires  
similar effort. Therefore ह-कार is replaced by घ-कार and not the other  
ka-varga letters.

Example of pramaanakruta sadrusyam:  
The example given अमुम्, अमू, अमून्  
I didn't understood this as well.

  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
