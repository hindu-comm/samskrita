You are right.  
The speech articulation automatically performs the sandhi - and this happens in all spoken languages.  
This is not a specialty of sanskrit. What is creditable about sanskrit is that the scholars recognised and recorded their observations under "sandhi".  
I think, sanskrit is the only language with formulated rules about this feature of spoken language.
