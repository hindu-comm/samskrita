Just to be clear. Members can post in English or Samskrit. This has been the list policy, and continues to be so. As long as posts remain relevant to Samskrit, you are free to use either of the two languages you prefer. If you have any questions, feel free to email me.  
  

Also, in approving a few posts in Samskrit in the past day or two, we have been fairly liberal in allowing posts. But please do not abuse this and post messages that are generally devoid of useful content.
