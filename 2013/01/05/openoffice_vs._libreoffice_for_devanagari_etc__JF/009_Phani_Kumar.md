Sir, I use a Mac myself(MacBook Pro Retina Display) with Mountain Lion as OS.

You are right. The Devanagari script works wonderfully generally speaking. But I couldnt find symbols like the avagraha I am not saying they are not there. Probably they are. But one doesnt know. The usually user friendly Mac doesnt tell us how to get ज्ञ and ञ. I learnt thru
so much trial and error that I might as well have been using Windows.
