I’ve always advised my Sanskrit students who own Macs to purchase a copy of Windows and set up their computer to dual-boot into Windows. They will have lots of देवनागरी support. A few years ago our university representatives were rudely treated by Apple when we requested more support and documentation for Indic languages. Their attitude seemed to be: “You bought an Apple; we’ve got your money; it’s your problem now!”

"Most Americans aren't the sort of citizens the Founding Fathers expected; they are contented serfs. Far from being active critics of government, they assume that its might makes it right."
