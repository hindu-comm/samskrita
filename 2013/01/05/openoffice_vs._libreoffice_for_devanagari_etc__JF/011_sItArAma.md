Namaste Phaniji,

You should try Option j for ज्ञ

Option n for ञ

I did not have any problem with it. There is an option where you can activate thevirtualkeyboard viewer which appears on the topcornerto show what you are keying in. That would save you hit and trial option. below video might help you.

Adolf I do not hold your views about Macagainst you, I have similar experience with Microsoft but thats not the point. Point is if Mac can do it or not and in my humble opinion i can do it as well as windows if not better.

  

regards

Raama
