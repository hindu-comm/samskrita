Thank you to everyone who responded. I have downloaded Libreoffice and am successfully using it with Baraha version 9 and I have also worked out how to create shortcuts to diacritics for writing Romanised Sanskrit. So far so good.

  

I am using Windows 8 so cannot comment on compatibility etc with Macs.
One additional note though - Baraha Direct doesn't seem to work with Chrome in WIndows 8. Perhaps the latest version of Baraha is required for this or perhaps Windows apps (if you use Chrome in Windows 8 it is an app) don't support external tools such as Baraha Direct.
