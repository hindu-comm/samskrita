Namaste

I am switching to open source office software and am not sure whether to go with Openoffice or Libreoffice. Does anyone have experience of either or both with respect to things like: using Devanagari (support for complex script, fonts, inputting Devanagari via Baraha etc), using diacritical marks, support for Unicode etc?

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Thank you

Venetia
