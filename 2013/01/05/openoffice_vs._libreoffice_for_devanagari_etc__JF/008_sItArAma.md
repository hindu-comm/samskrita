I use Mac and it does not require any additional software to type in Devanagri. One has to go to settings>\>\> Language \>\>\>\> and activate hindi / devanagari and thats all you can type in Devanagari.

I do not have any experience in typing Romanized text, personally I don'tlikeit.  
  
I checked on Mac OSX - snow leopard and with Libre office autocompletionworks great.
