I had the same query a few years ago. Many do not even know that she has rendered this holy shlokha in her soulful voice. On enquiring around, I was told by a few recording companies in Chennai that Lalitha Sahasranamam by MS is still copyright protected and is controlled by her estate. It is yet to come to public purview.

This is what we were told, this is only hearsay and there is no way to ascertain the authenticity.

The alternative happens to be Balamurli Krishnas superb rendition of Shri Lalitha Sahasranamam.

  

Hoping you find what you are looking for and if you are successful, share it with me too ;-)

  

Best wishes,

  

  

Surya
