Namaste  
  
Last weekend in Prayaga I heard about an अष्टटीकासङ्ग्रहः on Valmiki Ramayana which was published long ago. I do not have any publication details (neither did the scholar who mentioned this), but most likely the commentaries are  

1.  भूषण of गोविन्दराज  
2.  तिलक of राम  
3.  रामायणशिरोमणि of शिवसहाय  
4.  रामाभिरामी of नागेश 5.  रामनुजीय (of रामानुज?) 6.  तनिश्लोकी (of अहोबल?)  
7.  तत्त्वदीपिका of महेश्वरतीर्थ 8.  कतक??

My searches on the Internet led me to set of three of four commentaries, but the eight-commentary book is elusive - may be it is out of print. I shall be much obliged if the members can help me find the book and publisher.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
