Vimalaji,

  

I agree with what you have said. Knowledge knows no boundaries and to enter into chauvinistic arguments as to which 'culture' discovered what should now be forgotten and relegated to the 19th century when people really believed that this or that group of individuals was inherently superior to others.

  

The only thing I found somewhat jarring in your note was your observation about 'the dreadful man Macaulay.'.

  

I do not think that he was such was such a dreadful man. Like many other liberal British thinkers of those days he sincerely wanted to bring the light of modern Western thought to the Indians, who - and I agree with him in this - wereunabletoconceiveknowledge as anything other than that traditional learning of Shastras. He wanted to use the monies set aside by the Charter Act of 1833 for the benefit of 'learned natives' and wrote a long - and now famous - 'minute' in to explain what his ideal of a leaned native was. (Please see the whole long minute at<http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html>.)

  

While writing it, he, out of ignorance, did use some words and phrases dismissive of the ancient Indian learning and has thus opened a door to those who want to paint his as an arch-imperialist. But his 'minute' as a whole has onlybenefitedIndia and the Indians by dragging them into the modern world.

  

The question before us in the 21st century is whether we should read his 'minute' as a whole and reflect over its purport or continue with polemical and chauvinistic debate about this or that phrase in it.
