Welcome to the decision of the moderator Naresh.

  

I may add that any information provided may be supported with relevant quotations from original sources so that it can be verified by any from the source in Sanskrit. Just it is stated in Vedas or in Jyotisha or it means this thing or so doesn't mean anything as far as information is concerned. The meaning of every word or sentence is conditioned by the context and especially in Veda-s, there are many commentaries which could be verified by any if the information is available and the texts are available. Such bold statements in various blogspots of viki pedia articles are not reliable as for sources of information.
