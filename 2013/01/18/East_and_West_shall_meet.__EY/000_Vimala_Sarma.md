Dear Scholars



I want to say something of a very general nature about this ”Indian–foreign” arguments which keep popping up in various topics in this forum, because people tend to have strong feelings about this issue. I hope my detractors to this post will indulge my views.



Even from before Alexander’s campaign into India (now Pakistan) there have been trading contacts between India and the west – particular with Arabs, Persians Greek and also from the east - Chinese merchants and travellers who braved the Silk Route. (In those days the climate was wetter and it was possible to go from one riverbank town to the next.
The rivers have dried up and the towns are now gone). There was a healthy interchange of ideas between peoples (as there are to-day) , and ideas were assimilated and became part of Indian culture. For example the idea of writing with ink came from the Chinese. The exchange was both ways, the Chinese took away many Indian ideas, particularly about Buddhism. The concept of karma was known to Pythagoras. Over the millennia there were many peoples who came of India, to settle on the large Gangetic plains, who brought new ideas, and new languages. This all part of Indian culture to-day as these people’s genes became part of Indian genes to the extend they soon became indistinguishable, as distinct groups. Present day Western ideas are also being assimilated into India and these good ideas belong to all humanity not the prerogative of any group. The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who believed in traditional values realised this and overcame the taboo of not travelling overseas. He gained many new ideas about rigorous proof from the mathematician Hardy. The British education system in India (much criticised because of the dreadful man Macaulay) was on the whole a great benefit and produced many outstanding Indians, not only people highly literate in English but who could do much better than the British in their own exams!. British scholars made linguist strides by comparing Sanskrit with Greek and Latin and opened the doors to the systematic study of the language, for all. In our Vedas too there were ideas which seem nonsensical to-day because people did not know much about how the human body functioned, but there were also deep and profound ideas.



What is clear, and what I am trying to say is: that there is no culture which has a monopoly on ideas – they spring up everywhere and nowadays it is much easier to communicate these ideas. The British were invaded by the Romans, Norse, French but all the ideas, and “foreign words” which came from these peoples are English as they became assimilated.
This is a much shorter timescale than for India. But you never hear of English people having long debates on whether an idea was “English” or “foreign”, and insisting everything came from Britain since time immemorial!!. They just don’t care where ideas originated from, so long as it is now theirs to use and develop. This is a non-issue for them.



Then why do some Indians care so intensely whether something originated millennia ago outside India or not? What is the big deal if all these ideas and peoples are now Indian? I believe it is because many Indians have a sense of inferiority that they cannot bear to think any ideas are not “truly” Indian whatever this may mean. Everything has to read back into the Vedas somewhere, and there are also more recent Upanishads to fall back on! I think it is time we all, like my hero Ramanujan, moved on, acquired maturity and self-confidence, and not care where things come, especially when may have happened so long ago, and now part of Indian culture anyway.

\[If Rahu is in the 11th house then he will surely have gains. He may gain elephants, horses, chariots etc (all kinds of vehicles and life comforts) from the king of Mlecchas (from non-Hindu foreign authorities)\]



This is the translation I got for the text quoted from Garga Hora. Garga is a sage in Bhagavata Purana, who draw the Janmakundali of Srikrishna, and there may be many other Garga's before relating historical facts to the name of Garga. Now coming to the mention of

Mlecchadhipati, there are two works known by "yavana" equal to "MlecCha" as I can guess from the context by referring to

Rahu in 11th. House



यस्य लाभगतो राहुर्लाभो भवति निश्चयात्। म्लेच्छाधिपतितो नूनं गजवाजिरथादिकम्॥



यवनजातकम्, वृद्धयवनजातकम्, which may be referred conveniently by a Garga, contemporary or later to the composition of this astrological work named after यवनाचार्य or यवन as the source for his statement of prediction and need not be meaning as above, he will get from the king of mleccha-s. as the remark in the bracket seems to suggest.



Knowledge of Yavana's culture and writings was familiar by the time of the commentators on Panini's Ashtadhyayi who derives the word यवनानी to refer to the script लिपि used by यवन-s.

Whether this is equated with म्लेच्छ is a different thing.

The word itself occurs in यवनजातक also.along with dvija, vaishya etc. castes in the context of गर्भाधानाध्याय -

Patanjali says 'तस्माद्ब्राह्मणेन न म्लेच्छितवै नापभाषितवै म्लेच्छो ह वा एष यदपशब्दः' (पा.भा. पस्पशा) इति । The topic of Week Days had been discussed in this group long ago in this topic:
