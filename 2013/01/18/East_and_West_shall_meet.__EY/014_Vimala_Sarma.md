Venugopal Mahodaya

There are so many misunderstandings in this post that it is hard to know where to begin.



The first thing I want to say is getting good ideas from anywhere does not mean Indian culture is lost. There is no need to feel threatened.
We are strenghtened by good values and ideas, not diminished by them.

Dharmic ideas - what are these dharmic ideas you refer to? Kindness to others, compassion, fairness and justice, respect for women, equality, democracy, freedom from fear, dignity in living standards for all, protection of the sick, old, disabled and weak, equal rights for all irrespective of position, birth or socio-ecomonic status. Are these also dharmic values or not? Are these only to regarded as "western"? Are these not universal values? Has there been great stress on these ideas in Indian culture as a whole? Are these values only to be found in Indian culture and no where else?

The soul of Indian civilization as far I can see - its classical dance forms, theatre, vedic chanting, literature, classical music, poetry etc is very much a alive and more people of all backgounds are participating in these activities - to a high standard - than ever before, as they are now accessible to all.

Re Gurukulum system - How is it that we never heard about these schools until after the Bristish bought in their education system? How many people went to these schools? In particular, how many girls??? The Brahmacharya system was only for Brhamin boys. Was the curriculum broad? Were these schools trees with a mat, or the house of a guru accommodating a handful of students? They were not huge buildings educating hundreds of children of all backgounds were they? Even Nehru, the product of the best education system - east and west - was seduced by this "romantic idea" of the gurukulum and sent his daughter to the best of them at the time, Tagore's Shantiniketan but even so, her education and knowledge was nowhere near the standard of her father's.

Native americans, Incas, the Mayan civilization - These cultures in no way compare with Indian culture - for exmple the mayans practised human sacrifice.

Sanskrit - When William Jones came to Calcutta, he found the Vedas were a closed book and only read by some Brahmins (not all - most could not even read or understand the grammar - they only chanted from memory).
He was hard pressed to find anyone to teach him. Interest in the language only took off after he made the then stunning discovery relating to its realtionship to Indian-European languages. The British made dictionaries not (only Sanskrit but other Indian languages as well) grammars, readers, etc - after such careful and systematic study that they are still being used to-day. This they did in their spare time when not on adminstrative duties!  
Mathematics - it is easy to make claims like the ones you have made, but who were the people who discovered these mathematical ideas, what were their names? What was the dates of the discovery? This important to prove priority. Where were the mathematical proofs for their theorums published? Where was scholarship were one person follows up on another's work and develops and expands it? Where is the rigour, creativity and freedom of thought if nothing in the Vedas can be challenged?

Ramanujan - He would never have recived interantional acclaim in India.
This mind worked on a plane that hardly anybody in India could understand. He was recognised by Hardy, the best mathematician of the west of the time, for the genius that he was. Hardy recognised Ramanujan as having a mind much superior to his - scoring himself 20% and Ramanujan as 100% (he would have given him an even higher, if it was possible to get more!). But there was no jealousy, pettiness, seniority considerations, only admiration. Would this have happened at an Indian institution? Their collaboration was the most brilliant in mathematics.

There is no problem with being different and having respect for each others' cultures - I have no argument with that! But whether you recognise this or not India has assimilated ideas from all peoples over its very long history. All these have become Indian.
