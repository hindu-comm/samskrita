Vimalaji,

I agree with what you have said.  Knowledge knows no boundaries and to 
enter into chauvinistic arguments as to which 'culture' discovered what 
should now be forgotten and relegated to the 19th century when people 
really believed that this or that group of individuals was inherently 
superior to others.

The only thing I found somewhat jarring in your note was your observation 
about 'the dreadful man Macaulay.'.

I do not think that he was such was such a dreadful man.  Like many other 
liberal British thinkers of those days he sincerely wanted to bring the 
light of modern Western thought to the Indians, who - and I agree with him 
in this - were unable to conceive knowledge as anything other than that 
traditional learning of Shastras.  He wanted to use the monies set aside by 
the Charter Act of 1833 for the benefit of 'learned natives' and wrote a 
long - and now famous - 'minute' in to explain what his ideal of a leaned 
native was.  (Please see the whole long minute 
at http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html.)

While writing it, he, out of ignorance, did use some words and phrases 
dismissive of the ancient Indian learning and has thus opened a door to 
those who want to paint his as an arch-imperialist.  But his 'minute' as a 
whole has only benefited India and the Indians by dragging them into the 
modern world.

The question before us in the 21st century is whether we should read his 
'minute' as a whole and reflect over its purport or continue with polemical 
and chauvinistic debate about this or that phrase in it.
