Dear Madam,

  

Welcome to your frank opinion. This is a fact even in Tamil Sangam Era or before that there was marine mercantile interactivity in Tamil and on the western coast. But today nobody is ready to acknowledge there was such an interaction between the cultures. The same about the north west inter-action between the Cordova University and Arabic Culture. Leave out the Muslim Invasion in the later period. It has become a fashion to deny that we owed anything to any culture outside India. Either it is originated in West or East, all are pertinent to establish and the domination on the other.
