Precisely Venugopalji.  

  

All these geo-political tussles must be kept in mind by any Indian, and certainly by any Hindu - that too Samskrita-loving Hindu preaching in a Samskrita group - while learning or ascertaining the truth in the historical accounts that were and are by and large contoured by Western academicians since 18th century.

  

The Dhaarmic civilization (i.e., its thought system) has one unique attribute not seen in any other - its entire energy is spent on learning and knowing the truth (in all secular matters) and Truth (in the spiritual realm), be it of Indic origin or planet Pluto. This pursuit of truth and Truth has been going on since its pre-history when the whole earth was its playground (cf. tanmaataa pr\`thivee tatpitaa dyauh, vasudhaiva kutumbakam, kr\`Nvanto vishwamaaryam, shruNvantu vishwe amr\`tasya putraah, etc.). No other past or present civilization stands out in this respect, not even the pagan or the Maya, certainly not the highly primitive Greeko-Roman or the Western civilizations whose central feature was and is to conquer the other by hook or crook, more often by crook. Science and technology is a tool in its arsenal to this very goal of domination, exploitation, and extermination, if need be, and one can gather plenty of proof in its history starting with the Greek and Roman Republics to the current day. Many a scientist and technologist is a willing slave of this megalomaniac West; he does not hesitate to twist even scientific truths (cf. drug company funded research papers). Speeches of "seeking truth and Truth" sprang and still spring from Western Universalism's and the Godless science's (they are the two sides of the same coin) deceptive face. All the mooDa-s and pramooDa-s do get carried away.  

  

Whereas, truth (and Truth) is all we, the trustees of Dharma, are after. "Who am I (and why am I here), what is all this world (universe) around, and from whom or where did all these come, and what is or are the connections among these three" is all we ponder of. We are least interested in conquering even an ant. Our ancestors' inquiries covered the most mundane to the most sophisticated, the seen and the unseen, the heard and the unheard - none of them have been yet proved wrong.

  

This was not our mere history. Our pursuit of Truth is a daily affair even now. Some of the soorya upasthaana mantra-s recited eulogizing "satya" in the daily sandhyaavandana follow Rigveda sooktam 3-59 whose Rishi is given as Gaathinah Vishwamitra and the devataa as Mitra. Mitra is "satya." In the "mantra maarjana", the "soorya" of the morning oblation gets replaced by "satya" in the evening oblation. Ishaavaasya Upanishad's Rishi yearns "satya dharmaaya dr\`Staye". taittirIya's mahaanaaraayaNopanishad extols "satya" extensively. That unchanging indescribable One alone is the "satya" - ekam sat vipraah bahudhaa vadanti. A second pursuit of ours is jnaanam or chit through cultivating prajnaa and shraddhaa, and the third is aananda, the goal of every life - all by probing inward, and not by misappropriating and obliterating the other, since deep within is where these sat-chit-aananda exist in infinite streams. Thus we are 180-degree opposite to the "there is no God here" Semitic faiths, or the "no God anywhere" Leftists, or "I don't know or care about God" science. Seeking "satya" in the secular world and secular events follows as a corollary in our scheme of things. We are a unique people with our own self discovered and self developed ways and means in every pursuit (including in time keeping, vaara names, and yuga-manvantara trackings), be it secular, be it spiritual. naanya panthaa vidyate ayanaaya (taittireeya araNyaka, 3-7, 3-8).  

  

Today this unique tradition is transplanted and decorated on the West - which is really an epitome of "asatya" bhasmaasura - by its own children who profess love for Samskritam and seem to genuinely believe that they are profound "know it all" specials! In our tradition, such delusion is called "bhraanti."

  

Everything has become topsy turvy. Are these fellow brethren real and capable of thinking and investigating with an element of tapas or are they just content doing dukrun\~hi karaNe on the word "tapas"? Some of these posts make me wonder. But then, what do I know - pretty much nothing in light of all that is in and out to know.
