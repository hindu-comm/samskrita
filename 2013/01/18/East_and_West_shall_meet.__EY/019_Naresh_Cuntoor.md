Let us recap this thread briefly.  
  

1\. The original poster, Vimalaji, made the point that there have been exchanges between India and other regions, in terms of culture, knowledge etc. And not a one-way flow of knowledge in all respects.  
  

2\. Yes, there are differences. Yes, there should be mutual respect. No one in the thread disagreed(s).  
  

3\. Sri Bhat made a very valid suggestion early on to support assertions with traceable quotes from Sanskrit sources. Sadly this has been lacking in many posts - even those that seemingly give a lot of references or offer to provide references. All one sees in the email are reference numbers, but not complete traceable information.  
  

4\. Further, there are some basic human values that are shared across cultures. Certainly Indian traditions give a special place to them in Gita etc. But that does not mean that they are not unimportant to others or that others do not have a concept of it.  
  

5\. Regarding girls in gurukula system - again, please provide traceable Sanskrit sources. I am sure this would be of interest to many.  
  

6\. Regarding reaction to Macaulay's minutes. One cannot see how even the most ardent admirer can ignore Macaulay's biases.  
  

I am sure I missed a few points raised - but the above stand out in reading all the emails in the thread.  
  

So going forward, here is what I would suggest -  
  

\(a\) Both items 5 and 6 above may be of general interest to members. So you are welcome to start separate threads to discuss those issues. That way those not interested can ignore the thread. Similarly, if you want to discuss other points raised in this thread, you are welcome to do so. As long as (b) is met.  
  

\(b\) Provide traceable, Sanskrit sources to support your claims.  
  

\(c\) Keep your email short and focused -- readers (and moderators) will thank you for it.  
  

\(d\) Items like Pythagoras theorem vs. Baudhayana sutra etc. have been rehashed multiple times on this list. To make the discussion of these things informative and interesting, quote the sources and explain them. Otherwise emails of the following kind "Indians did X, Y and Z before anyone else" will probably be rejected.  
  
  

Finally, as always, civility in posts, please.  
  
  

\- Naresh
