Dear Vimala ji,  
  
I have a question for you, have you read Rajiv Malhotra's "Being Different"? if you haven't please read it. In it, he talks about this universalism you talk about. this universalism of ideas belonging to all. Ideas thought belong to others, they differ in wide spectrum and uniqueness. And under the garb of universalism, eastern civilizational ethoes are slowly digested and assimilated. In the end the digested civilization is egested out as waste product.  
  
When you talk about western ideas being assimilated, you are basically talking about slow digestion of dharmic ideas and concepts that we being slowly replaced by alien ones. What good is a civilization which is lost and whose soul is sold out?  
  
Then you talk about British educational system. Sir/Ma'am could you please enumerate what great benefit did that educational system brought to India? the educational system so praised about is the reason for the demise of Sanskrit. The every first thing the British did under the leadeship of Macaulay was to replace sanskrit schools and gurukulas in India and introduce western educational system. And what makes you think that western educcational system is one ace up Indian educational system? Please kindly enumarate and I will await your explanation.  
  
The linguistic strides you talk about also aren't something born out of eagerness to know and understand Sanskrit but with an intention born out to seek a self identity which most Europeans felt lost during the romatic period. In fact these linguistic studies carried out under imperialism never allowed Sanskrit to take it's right ful place as the mother of Indo Eurpean languages. So much for European scholarship you eulogize.  
  
You never hear of the west debating because it is not them trying to fight to retain an identity. It is us who are trying to retain a different take on civilizational ethoes. They always have digested civilizations, think native americans, Incas, the Mayan civilization, what happened to them? where are they now?  
  
You seem to think that only Indians like to debate and fight. But why not? thinking again, the west too figthts and usurps and digests other civilizations, how you might ask, the conversions, digestion of dharmic ideas and fear of being different and thus imposition of western views in the form of universalism is the way the west actually imposes and fights. So you stating tat the west doesnt have debates or fights is too naive.  
  
Indians who fight for the ideas which originated in India so much because they care to be different, they don't want their cilization to be digested by the west and the originators of the ideas are never even mentioned. Since you bring up Ramanujan, many of the mathematical ideas like the so called pythagoras theorem, infinite series, calculus, concept of zero, factrals are indians inventions. Now take any western authored mathematics book and show me any reference and acknowledgement of these facts? no where is it ackowledged in the west that calculus is an Indian invention. You wrongly accuse Indians who are tryint to protect their dharmic civilization and values. It is actually the other way round. Indians who don't care much about their identity, those who think the west is better are the ones who suffer from complex that they willingly give up their identity and differences just so they get accepted by the west. So who is suffering from complex? the ones who are trying to preserve their separate identity or the ones who are ready to give up an identity such so they are accepted by others?  
  
Here are two links to an awesome expositions about the importance of Sanskrit, and the importance of maintaining Indian and dharmic identity as a different from the west by Rajiv Malhotra. Why shouldnt as all be different and yet have mutual respect for each others civilization? what is the need to be assimilated in the garb of universalism of the west?
