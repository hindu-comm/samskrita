Very sensible post. At the same time it raises a very serious question.

Most of the doubts raised by people who question the origin and validity of centuries old practices of Hinduism and Hindusthan are done with ulterior motives.

Of late, it has become fashionable to debunk the Glory of our traditions and culture.

  

Best regards,
