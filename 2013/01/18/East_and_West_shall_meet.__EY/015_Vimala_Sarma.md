Dear Venugopal Mahodaya

I think you are only on a different plane of reality but also on a different planet from me! All I can say is that you are wrong in your views - but you will not see this so there is no point in correcting you.

Of course I know that women were brahmavids and participated in brahmodyas in the Vedas - it as only after Manusastra when things went downhill! Of course the Buddhist had nuns from the beginning.

You are just wrong about William Jones, and wrong about the masses being educated through gurukulum (supposedly destroyed by the British) before colonial times - there is nothing more to say about this. You are still free to go gurukulum if you wish.

You cannot except people to accept theorums if there is no proof and no dates. It is does not have to be written on paper or journals. Just stating the theorem in Sanskrit is not proof.

Yes Pythagoras used a geometric proof for this theorem and this is document ted. This was rigorous.

I don't understand how to came to this statement re Rumanian- "thanks for acknowledging that he was completely ignored by the British government".?????  
I was saying the opposite - he was recognised and supported by the British!!!

By the way, I am a woman as you can see by my name and how I have been addressed by others in this group.

Best wishes

Vimala

Dear Sri Vimala ji and other Learned sirs,  
  
I apologize if this is going to be a long mail, but wanted to say something and rebut your points. Vimala ji can choose to ignore it given that he/she already said his/last response was the last one on the subject. But I thought I must reply for the benefit of others, so here:  
  
Fistly Knowledge doesn't belong to one that is true. There has to be free flow of knowledge, it can't be one sided not can there be tolerance, there has to be mutual respect of cultures, philosophies and religions. Our Indian cultures always welcomed people of different religions and philosophies which is self evident. But question your fellow Western if they would have tolerance for other people or mutual respect of people who are from different religions and philosophies. Rajiv Malhotra through his experiences tells us that the west has tolerance for non-west than mutual respect. Mutual respect means acceptance of of our Indian civilization as the same at the least as other western civilizations. But his experiences tells him that the west never was ready to accord mutual respect to Hinduism, it's precepts or it's culture. So when knowledge sharing and respect is knwed and asymmetric, there what is anything to share? As Rajiv Malhotra points it out, tolerance is accorded to something you think less of, like you tolerate your very talkative friend, you tolerate something which is irritating but you put up with anyway but you dont accord mutual respect. Now if tolerance is the best the west can do, who is threatened? the west or the east?

  
  
  
*\>\>Dharmic ideas - what are these dharmic ideas you refer to?
Kindness to others, compassion, fairness and justice, respect for women, equality, democracy, freedom from fear, dignity in living standards for all, protection of the sick, old, disabled and weak, equal rights for all irrespective of position, birth or socio-ecomonic status. Are these also dharmic values or not? Are these only to regarded as "western"? Are these not universal values? Has there been great stress on these ideas in Indian culture as a whole? Are these values only to be found in Indian culture and no where else?*  
  

Vimalaji, It appaears you are confused with universalism and taking dharmic values and calling them universal values. Dharmic values are endemic, they are universal truths, however, universalism is universalism as seen through the eyes of the west, they are the values which the west has accepted as such and wants everyone to accept them...any differences in culture, values, philosophies when different from the western system, aren't considered universal by the west hence it wants to do away with by bringing sameness, this doing away is destruction of the civilizations as it accorded to native American, Mayan, Incan and many of the civilizations that stood in it's way in the past. While Dharmic values did none of that. So I ask you again, who is thereatened?

  
  
  
*\>\>The soul of Indian civilization as far I can see - its classical dance forms, theatre, vedic chanting, literature, classical music, poetry etc is very much a alive and more people of all backgounds are participating in these activities - to a high standard - than ever before, as they are now accessible to all.  
*  

I am not disagreeing to that, but they can't be digested to the western system and be called something else nor there is any need to call it something else such to make it palatable for the western folk. Like Yoga is being re bottled to be called something so that it has nothing to do with Hindu tradition. Why the need to relable it so? because there are religious sections of in America who have protested Yoga being taught there. When a concept is digested and repackaged, the original meaning and purpose is lost. What remains is waste product. Kindly read "Being different" to understand this civilizational digestion.

  
  
  
*\>\>Re Gurukulum system - How is it that we never heard about these schools until after the Bristish bought in their education system? How many people went to these schools? In particular, how many girls???
The Brahmacharya system was only for Brhamin boys. Was the curriculum broad? Were these schools trees with a mat, or the house of a guru accommodating a handful of students? They were not huge buildings educating hundreds of children of all backgounds were they? Even Nehru, the product of the best education system - east and west - was seduced by this "romantic idea" of the gurukulum and sent his daughter to the best of them at the time, Tagore's Shantiniketan but even so, her education and knowledge was nowhere near the standard of her father's.*  
  

Sir, I kindly ask you, just because you didn't hear of it, doesn't mean no one heard of it. Sanskritam was taught to everyone in pre-colonial Indian masses, irrespective of caste. The educational system the Brtish brought you are so proud about was literally non-existent in England itself. Not many students attended schools in Egland itself. Due to poverty and inaccessibility of schools to common man in England, in 18th and 17th centuries, practically schools in England were empty. Compared to that education in India was very vibrant. Each School or gurukula could have handful of students, but education was avaliable to many and wasn't resrticted contrary to the myth of prefeerential education in India, I can quote you studies and books if you so wish. And Sir, what has Brahmacharya got to do with this education you are talking about?  
  
And you raise some very naive and surpsingly simplistic questions about "cirriculm board" and "buildings". Curriculum boards and buildings are western constructs, you wont find them in Indian context, you asking about them is me asking you to show me gurukulas in Americas because these days Americans too study Vedas. Certianly the teachers had teaching methodology which varied from gurukula to gurukula, like vyakarana, upanishads, naya sastras etc which are taught based on students graduation and learning skill one doesn't need "cirriculm boards" for that and in the west too this was a very vague concept that you applying. Second, one doesn't need buildings for propagation of knowledge, your thinking that if education is not imparted in buildings it is not "real" education is laughable, it is like saying a person who doesn't wear pants and shirt is not civilized.  
  
Now regarding girls students:  
  
Did you know that girls were always present in Indian schools till the British came into India? in fact it is the west that prohibited girls education where they were given admission in very recent western history. So here is the list of presence of girls in Indian schools in the ancient times and till the British came to Indian and destroyed the system:  
  
  
1. In Vedic times, there was no discrimination of sex in the field of studies. A particular mantra was prescribed to beget a learned daughter in Brihadaranyaka upanishad \[2\]. In the same upanishad, we find Gargi and Maitreyi distinguishing themselves in Brahmavidya, the highest knowledge. In the grihyasutras are found several mantras to be recited by women and the commentary on Gobhilagrihyasutras, states that the female-folk should be taught, for without such studies they cannot perform agnihotra sacrifice \[3\]. Both Panini and Patanjali refer to women admitted to Vedic study. Thus a woman-student of the Katha school was called a Kathi, and the Rigvedic Bahvricha school, Bahvrichi. Female students were also admitted to the study of mimamsa and the one who studied mimamsa-sutra of the sage Kasakritsna is called Kasakritsna. There were chhatri (lady students) and Upadhyayi (Lady teachers)\[4\].  
  
2. Buddistic and Jaina faiths had comparatively more freedom to pursue the path of knowledge because womanhood was no bar to salvation as per their respective precepts. From Asokan times we find women becoming preceptors and nuns and even going outside India for teaching Buddhism. Among the women authors of the Therigatha (stories of nuns) 32 were unmarried women and 18 were married ones. When so large a number of women were leading a life of celibacy, in pursuit of religion and philosophy, it is but natural that the average level of intelligence and education among them must have been fairly high according to Dr. Altekar \[14\]. Hiuen Tsang has observed that Rajyasri, the sister of Harshavardhana was of great intelligence and distinguished for her knowledge of Sammatiya school of Buddhism. She sat along with the king and seemed to appreciate the learned discourse of Hiuen Tsang on the Mahayana doctrine \[15\].  
  
3. The Virasaiva movement set in motion liberating influences among which emancipation of women was one. The women apostles like Akkamahadevi, Moligeya Mahadevi, Viradevi, the reciter (uggadisuva kanne), Sivamayidevi, the reconteur of moral stories, and other Siva-saranes (saints), helped in the spread of education by imparting the spiritual message. They reached the poor, the humble and the illiterate. Their aim was to make the people aware of the highest products of the human mind, rather than make them read, write and cipher. Indeed culture, not literacy, was the highest aim of education in ancient India  
  
4. An organised system of education which trained all these women for various occupations. We do not have evidence of public schools except the ones mentioned by Ibn Battuta (14th century A.D.), who had noticed 13 schools for girls along with 23 for boys in Honavar, like of which he "had not seen any where" \[26\]. He was a great traveller and had toured through much of the then known world and his observation carries great weight, that too, when he refers to Muslim girls who attended Public Schools without observing purda. The mode of educating women in ancient and medieval Karnataka was mainly domestic. We come across expressions like Oduva Honnamma and Oduva Tirumalamba signifying that there used to be staff to teach through reading classics, and other books \[27\]. The existence of such teachers and halls in the palaces provided instruction for the nobility and education on similar but modest lines must have existed for women of other classes.  
  
For brevity sake I have limited the list. I can provide yourefences if you so request.

  
  
  
*\>\>Native americans, Incas, the Mayan civilization - These cultures in no way compare with Indian culture - for exmple the mayans practised human sacrifice.*  
  

I didn't quote them to compare them to Indian civilization.

  
  
  
*\>\>Sanskrit - When William Jones came to Calcutta, he found the Vedas were a closed book and only read by some Brahmins (not all - most could not even read or understand the grammar - they only chanted from memory). He was hard pressed to find anyone to teach him. Interest in the language only took off after he made the then stunning discovery relating to its realtionship to Indian-European languages. The British made dictionaries not (only Sanskrit but other Indian languages as well) grammars, readers, etc - after such careful and systematic study that they are still being used to-day. This they did in their spare time when not on adminstrative duties!  
*  

This is one of the bbiggest lies which is told again and again, kindly read:  
"Lies With Long Legs - Discoveries, Scholars, Science, Enlightenment Documentary Narration" by Prodosh Aich. In an interview a question was posed to which he answers thus:  
  
Q: But Brahmins or Pundits would not encourage any foreigner to learn Sanskrit and read religious book?  
  
A: Who told you this? It is wrong. The story was told by William Jones. But is not based on facts. It was never sacred. Learning Sanskrit was a difficult task Brahmins had the privilege of servicing others by reciting Sanskrit texts to them. Whether they understood it or not was a different issue. This was inherited from one generation to other. They knew Sanskrit but how did the British learnt it. Christian mind created stories around fragments of information. Their stories are reflection of their minds. It was not the translation of Bhagvat Gita but what they sold it as Bhagvat Gita. Then Europeans who never came to India but learnt Sanskrit alphabets and saw Bhagvat Gita and recognised its alphabets. They could possibly recognise words but they did not understand it. So they would collect more book and apply their Christian mind and say that this is not logical so it has to be this or that. In this process, they were also trying to compile a dictionary. There was never a Sanskrit dictionary as grammar is the key to Sanskrit language. But they were trying to compile a dictionary word by word. So in this way they have transported a type of Sanskrit to Europe where I have doubts that it is Sanskrit at all. But the tragic part is that this Sanskrit has been imported back to India. This is what we learn in India with the help of the Sanskrit dictionaries. The standard dictionary of Sanskirt here is of Sir Monier Monier who also never came to India before compiling his dictionary in 1854. He collected all materials and prepared a dictionary diligently. But this dictionary was not available to Max Mueller. Max Mueller had only one dictionary written by one Wilson. He also stayed in Calcutta. He was a medical doctor. He served as Director of a mint because he had some knowledge of chemicals. He interacted with Bengali Pundits and he prepared the dictionary with the help of the Pundits of Calcutta in as late as 1819 when the first Sanskrit dictionary came out. At best, Max Mueller could have used this dictionary. Max Mueller was at a place where Wilson taught Sanskrit. Max Mueller observes in his biography that Wilson did not have enough knowledge of Sanskrit.

  
  
*\>\>Mathematics - it is easy to make claims like the ones you have made, but who were the people who discovered these mathematical ideas, what were their names? What was the dates of the discovery? This important to prove priority. Where were the mathematical proofs for their theorums published? Where was scholarship were one person follows up on another's work and develops and expands it? Where is the rigour, creativity and freedom of thought if nothing in the Vedas can be challenged?*  
  

These are good questions, but again by asking where the proofs are published? I am not sure if you are being naive or making yourself a laughing stock, for these discoveries are ancient, not that proofs and concepts don't exist, they do, but paper publishing didn't start untill few hundred years back, and no journals existed at that time and you are asking me to name where they were published? where is the rigor? why don't you ask Pythagoras the rigor? why did you accept the theorem without asking him the rigor? Purva paksha and debates were the rote of those days when arguments and counter arugments were the norm in those days. If you want rigor, you will have to ask the same to your western counterparts too. Anyway, here is the list of discoveries which the west stole and calls it as their work:  
  
1. It was Baudhāyana who discovered the Pythagoras theorem. Baudhāyana listed Pythagoras theorem in his book called Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra (800 BCE). Incidentally, Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra is also one of the oldest books on advanced Mathematics. The actual shloka (verse) in Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra that describes Pythagoras theorem is given below :  
  
“dīrghasyākṣaṇayā rajjuH pārśvamānī, tiryaDaM mānī, cha yatpṛthagbhUte kurutastadubhayāṅ karoti.”  
  
2. The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics was founded in the late 14th Century by Madhava of Sangamagrama, sometimes called the greatest mathematician-astronomer of medieval India. He developed infinite series approximations for a range of trigonometric functions, including π, sine, etc. Some of his contributions to geometry and algebra and his early forms of differentiation and integration for simple functions may have been transmitted to Europe via Jesuit mission, you can refer to this article:  
  
<http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/calculus-was-developed-in-medieval-india>  
  
I can provide you even more exhaustive if you so desire.

  
  
*\>\>Ramanujan - He would never have recived interantional acclaim in India. This mind worked on a plane that hardly anybody in India could understand. He was recognised by Hardy, the best mathematician of the west of the time, for the genius that he was. Hardy recognised Ramanujan as having a mind much superior to his - scoring himself 20% and Ramanujan as 100% (he would have given him an even higher, if it was possible to get more!). But there was no jealousy, pettiness, seniority considerations, only admiration. Would this have happened at an Indian institution? Their collaboration was the most brilliant in mathematics.  
*  

Sir, I too have read Ramanujan's biography "The man who knew infinity by Robert Kenigel", I also know under what conditions he sent the mail to Hardy and how Hardy discovered him, thanks for acknowledging that he was completely ignored by the British government. Thank you for that.  
  
  
Yes my final post of this too, unless Vimala ji wants to counter this.  
  
Warm regards,
