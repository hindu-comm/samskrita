For those of you planning to upgrade to Windows 8 please note the following caveat:

## Office 2003 applications are not compatible with Windows 8

If you're still running Office 2003 or older, think twice before you decide to upgrade to Windows 8. There are incompatibilities and it's likely you will have problems with the Office programs if you try to use them on Windows 8. Office 2007, 2010 and 2013 are compatible with Windows 8. [This is documented in KB article 2777626.](http://message.gfi.com/t?r=22&c=180431&l=443&ctl=107B21:0ED6C60D054BEDFFF48D7F8466AD52CBA06B0A43150A7303&)

My comment: it is worthwhile to upgrade to Win 8 AND MS Word 2013. For my Sanskrit work I have really enjoyed using Word 2013. It has many small feature improvements for those of us who type in देवनागरी.

**नारायणं नमस्कृत्य नरं चैव नरोत्तमम्**

**देवीं सरस्वतीं चैव ततो जयमुदीरयेत्**

Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted being, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word *Jaya* be uttered.
