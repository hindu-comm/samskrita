Dear all,



The Book written by Michel Danino and Sujatha Nahar - **"The Invasion that never was"** is the outcome of a deep research done in the given area; Mr. Danino clearly mentions that Sanskrit is **prior to** both Greek and Latin;



Also, any Post Graduate in English literature learns as part of Etymology that the words such as father, brother widow........... are all routed to the English languagefrom Sanskrit to Latin and from Latin to English.



If I speak more about the book, it will be like going out of the context towards the conflict regarding Indus Valley Civilization.
