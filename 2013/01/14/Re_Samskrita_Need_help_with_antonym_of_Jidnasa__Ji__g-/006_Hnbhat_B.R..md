If you don't have जिज्ञासा nobody can make yo to know.जिज्ञास(+ति)is the desiderative verb form of the root ज्ञा and the derived participles are ज्ञातुमिच्छा - the desire to know is a noun in the feminine isजिज्ञासा which has fixed grammatical gender. And the participle active is जिज्ञासुः in masculine or feminine, usually in masculine, but can be used as adjective too if context requires.

  

You can find in any dictionaries also these two words.

  

With regards
