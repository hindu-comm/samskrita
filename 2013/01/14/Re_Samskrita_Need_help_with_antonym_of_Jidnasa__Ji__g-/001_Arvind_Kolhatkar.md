I think by definition only words that qualify something or someone else, such as adjectives and adverbs, can have antonyms. For example, clever-dull, brave-timid, tall-short etc. A noun cannot have an antonym. "Father' is not the antonym of 'mother'.

  

Sinceजिज्ञासा is a noun, its opposite can only be 'absence ofजिज्ञासा'.
