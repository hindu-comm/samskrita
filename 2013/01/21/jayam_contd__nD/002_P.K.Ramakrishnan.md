अङ्कानां वामतो गति: -

  

How -

When you want to write 8 you write 8 in the one position. एकस्थान.

When you want to write 28 you put 2 on the left side of 8.

When you want to write 528 you put 5 on the left side of 28.

So the number increases in value by going left.

  

आयुरारोग्यसौख्यम् is the famous last word of Narayaneeyam.

In addition to ayuh, arogyam and soukhyam it also gives the

kalidinasamkya of the day the stotram was completed.

Becasue of angaanaam vaamato gatih it has to be read as

1712210.

I do not understand the meaning of what you say in Sanskrit.

  

In गोपीवल्लभ etc the writer wanted to show a large number.

Also it the number is 3.1434 and so on. It has no end. So

the authour has not followed the rule. The rule ankaanaam

vaamato gatih was given when there was no concept of decimals.
