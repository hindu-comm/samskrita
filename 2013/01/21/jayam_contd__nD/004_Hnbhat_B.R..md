The same Karika uses both systems in the same Karika:

  

पदैकदेशरचनावर्णेष्वपि रसादयः ।

भेदास्तद् ए**कपञ्चाशत् (५१)**तेषां चान्योन्ययोजने ॥ 43 ॥

  

संकरेण त्रिरूपेण संसृष्ट्या चैकरूपया ।

*वेदखाब्धिवियच्चन्द्राः* *शरेषुयुगखेन्दवः* ॥ 44 ॥

  

The first is using the number 51 as using words एक - 1 + पञ्चाशत् ५० which can be read as Fifty One 51 in English words using Arabic numerals, corresponding to using Devanagari ५१ and not as 15 as it is written in words in Sanskrit. usual and the next also is the same, but using a different system.

  

The second explained in the commentary itself 4.43ab:

This meaning is not Ramakrishnan's invention or his idea अंकानां वामतो गतिः = गणनम्, as you can see from the commentary.

  

Here is the commentary on the next line: 4.44cd
