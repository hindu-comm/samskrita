This has been discussed long ago in this group in another thread. Repeating the same questions and answers doesn't add any more information.

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/samskrita/Y_gYBLi9VMo/discussion>

  

and my explanation/view is in this reply:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/Y_gYBLi9VMo/mBinJT0lgIUJ>  

  

  

AND the topic is recently added with a reply stating that the system is optional.

And for Vedic Mathematics the book is a new creation by a Sanskritist Mathematician, which is discussed also in many groups and the originality claimed by the writer has been contested by many. Whether he recovered from Veda-s or composed himself with his mathematics skill, like the magic number of C Ramanujan, with his date of birth, (a trick displayed as magic number of Ramanujan in many sites) it is available in printed form than in the Vedic Texts available. Such modern works need not be depended to question a system attested in many original work and interpretations modern mathematical thought.

  

In my reply in the above I have given the quotation from Kavyaprakasha, for the system used in कारिका-s composed in 12th Century itself,
outside the works other than Astronomical and astrological (Siddhanta) texts. Kavyaprakasha use this system to enumerate the classification of Vyangya and the number can be worked out to the number indicated and there is no other way or doubt about it. Why to use the rule to interpret anything otherwise?
