hariH OM,  
  

"This was the question under consideration. Macaulay was batting for English because it would make all knowledge in the English language accessible - modern up-to-date knowledge, and the give Indians the tools for scientific inquiry and learning. History, geography. science, mathematics, economics, engineering, etc, etc - it was not just a language issue, but a knowledge issue."

 This is like saying the British looted India because they wanted us to know how rich we were. Enslavement of a nation cannot be complete unless their language and traditions are denigrated and made into a laughing stock. This is what Macaulay sought to do and to call that as an effort to make Indians aware of knowledge is preposterous. I don't find any difference between your argument and Churchill's (white man's burden etc.).  
  

 If the British were so keen on bringing in knowledge (in their great good intentions), why did they destroy all production capacity in India with their cheap goods??? Why was it necessary for them to impose 700% tax on even salt (this is only one example among various ones which were used to destroy Indigenous industry)? Have you forgotten the salt satyagraha? For the benefit of likeminded friends, let me recollect the facts as they were:  

The brits used to take cotton from India to their mills in Manchester and used to send us finished goods.  
One knows that the finished product (clothes) will occupy much lesser volume than cotton. Hence if 10 ships went with cotton, only say, 2 ships were required for finished goods. All the 10 ships had to return to India because they had to carry cotton again. What do they do with the remaining 8 empty ships? The brits hit upon a brilliant idea: They will carry salt from salt pans of Gibraltar and carry them to India and sell it to Indians at cheap rates and the indigenous salt will be taxed at 700%. This destroyed the livelihood of various castes in India. In karnataka there were various castes whose traditional occupation was making salt (uppAra etc.). They were destroyed completely.  
 Now, this is what the brits did to us. Some people will say, they did this because they wanted us to taste the salt of Gibraltar!!! What an idea sir ji!!!  
  

 What they did to domestic trade by imposing high taxes on the movement of goods. This gave rise to the great famines in India. This has been documented and analyzed by Amartya Sen (this is why he got the nobel prize). Let us not forget that the high rates of taxes heralded the beginning of wide spread corruption in India (is is nobody's case that corruption didn't exist before that, what I am trying to say that it became more prevalent during this time).  
  

 There are people who thank the brits for the railway system. Please read an interesting article here:  
<http://2ndlook.wordpress.com/2010/08/26/indian-railways-the-british-legacy/>  

 the summary of the article is that the brits plan of laying Indian railways was to loot India by other means (the per kilometer cost of laying rails in India was more than double that in Europe). And still people thank the brits!  

  

"History has proven his decision to be the correct one. This made Indians on par with the Brits and everyone else in education and knowledge, and opened up the world to Indians."

 It made "SOME" Indians on par with the brits whereas the majority of Indians, i.e. those who didn't have access to costly english education were made into intellectual slaves.  
  

"He made the remark about a shelf in an English library because he was thinking about factual information. You cannot turn to a Sanskrit book to find out Moscow is capital of Russia or the dates for Ming Dynasty in China, etc, etc."  

 If the British government were to finance projects which made Sanskrit books carry this information, the books would have carried that information. The fact that they didn't do it is testimony to the fact that they wanted Indians at large to be enslaved to them. Control Information and control the course of History. Those were the days when we didn't have internet.

  
  
"If Indians wanted Sanskrit to continue why did they not pay for teachers and schools to teach this language and keep it going. "  

 The very fact that samskR^itam survives even today is because it was taught by a group of dedicated people who didn't bother about their own livelihood. Hence your above statement is unfair. SamskR^itam survives to this day. The reason it got relegated from the national mainstream is because of the Brits. Once power is not associated with a language, it wanes. See what happened to many African countries... See what happened to the native languages of Southern America. It is the dedication of the self same hated Brahmins whom some people target which ensured that samskR^itam survives to this day.

  
  
"This state of affairs has been commented upon by Professor Sheldon Pollock. "  

 Madam, please don't bring down the level of this discussion by bringing in Sheldon Pollock. He has an axe to grind in telling Indians that SamskR^itam is in danger. I had an occasion to bring out the inconsistencies in his article here:  
<http://paryayavak.blogspot.in/2012/09/sheldon-pollocks-scare-mongering-about.html>

  
  
"It is indeed an indictment that we have to rely on British sources find about indigenous education and the Indians keep no records themselves."  

 A community which has been brutalized for 1000 + years forgets about history and historiography. It becomes more focussed on survival. Hence to accuse them of not being good historians is unfair.  
  

 The british conducted the survey as quoted in "The beautiful tree" to see how they could destroy this indigenous education system and introduce their own. We can forget it only at our own peril.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
