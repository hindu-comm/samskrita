First, there are statements that can be described charitably, as ignorant and certainly chauvinistic. Statements like "a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia", "when we pass from works imagination to works in which facts are recorded, and general principles investigated, the superiority of the European (languages) becomes absolutely immeasurable", and other statements which Arvindji claims should not be read in isolation. That is like wanting to have the proverbial cake and eat it too. Yes, we should read the minutes in full. By the same token, one cannot dismiss statements like the ones above.  
  
In fact, why stop at reading the minute in full? Let us go one step further and understand its background for a fuller appreciation of things. In a series of emails I plan to do just that. I'll draw from two sources to explain this -- Elmer Cutts' article on the "Background of Macaulay's minutes" published in the American Historical Review '53, and the minutes themselves.  
  
Let us start with the background. Cutts article is quite comprehensive. I will highlight a few aspects. Those who are interested can read the article.  
  
"Useful knowledge":  
As early as the 1790s, people behind British education policy in India wanted to teach "useful knowledge" instead of Hindu knowledge (or Muslim knowledge). This was the then current evangelical usage.  
  
It is with this background that one reads James Mill's promotion of useful knowledge", Macaulay's wish to create "a class .. Indian in blood and color, but English in taste...", and Macaualay's wish to "teach European (sic) science".  
  
Native support:  
There were several Indian voices that lent crucial support for the adoption of English (at the expense of Indian languages). Some well-known names like Ram Mohan Roy, and other lesser known names like Jai Narayan, Raja Badrinath Rai.  
  
In fact as early in the 1820s, Ram Mohan Roy questioned the need for Sanskrit studies when there was talk of such a program in a Calcutta college.  
  
Let us pause here for a minute and observe a few things. Macaulay at this point, hardly comes off as a benevolent liberal when one reads his statements in the above context. And then there is the comment about wanting to teach "European science". So much for Indian contribution to mathematics a long time ago.  
  
That seems to be a good place to stop and reflect. I will pick up from here in the next email.
