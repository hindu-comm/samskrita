Respected Scholars,

Clearing a Doubt on Macaulay’s ‘Minute’

On the subject of Macaulay’s minute’, Shri Arvind Kolhatkar-ji had, last year, posted a lot of information and analysis. Recently once again he has posted the ‘minute’. I read the ‘minute’ both the times and while I agree in a general way on the view Shri Arvind-ji recommends one should take on the ‘minute’, **there is one point that remains unexplained to my mind, in that, some 62 years ago when I was in school (8th Standard), the history we were taught was not Indian history but the English history...Alfred the Great, Edgar the peaceful, William the Conquerer etc. And I am sure that must have been happening decades before I was even born **How did this happen? Was it not due Macaulay's direction that such a syllabus was designed for schools in India (perhaps using the ‘catch them young’ policy) ? Or it was the case that some British 'babu' down the line forced his own anti-India interpretation of Macaulay's view! It was only a year later that we learnt about India’s Maurya dynasty...Ashoka the great and so on!

I thought I would post this only because Macaulay has been discussed very passionately

on both sides of the table.

Despite the above doubt, I do feel that whatever happened due to or after Macaulay, India has surely benefitted. **And I am even inclined to believe that it is perhaps because of the objective analytical vigour inculcated by the much maligned Macaulay's direction in education that today we are able to understand the greatness and significance of our
own ancestral teachings. That of course is my personal view.**

Regards to scholars…Shreyas
