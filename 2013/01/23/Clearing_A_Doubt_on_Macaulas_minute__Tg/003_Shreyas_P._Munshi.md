Respected Arvind Kolhatkar Sir,

Althlough in your above sentence you call your post a 'long' one, I would have loved if it were longer! I have come to know more of the liberal thought that prevailed among some section of the population in England at that time. I am in fact very much grateful to you because it was because of your post on Macaulay last year that I started viewing Macaulay from a different perspective.

And yet since I had a doubt, i sought clarification. My school was in Mumbai and it was not a missionary school (Sheth Anandilal Podar High Schhol) and our teachers were all Marathi and Gujarati. They spoke English in their local accent but, to me, each one of them appeared to be a very well read scholar, although their degrees were not more than BA or MA. I remember asking for answer to my doubt and our dhoti-jacket-black topi clad history teacher had laughed and said that it was going on since he was a child and that ‘it’s you all who have to mend it’. Later on someone told me that it was all Lord Macaulay’s doing and that is where I got prejudiced against Macaulay. So, despite all good things you have highlighted about Macaulay, I wanted to know more of the ‘other side’. Surely, I cant be blamed! Hope you understand and pardon me.

Regards…Shreyass

Subject: \[Samskrita\] Clearing A Doubt on Macaula's 'minute'  

Dear Munshiji,



Our memories of what type of Hhistory was taught to us 62 years ago certainly differ greatly. I too was in the middle school 62 years ago and I distinctly remember that what was taught to us in our Marathi school for history was all Indian - Shivaji, Mughals, Rani Lakshmi Bai etc. (I even remember our childish prank of attaching a beard to the picture of Chand Bibi of the Nizamshahi dynasty of Ahmednagar and turning her into Shivaji!) There was no British history at any time in our school till our SSC. Those days were post-independence and I wonder how your School continued to teach British – rather than Indian – history to its students. I do not think that that was the practice elsewhere. Perhaps, others whose memory goes back that far, can share their views.What I know of British History has been gathered by me
through my own reading in later days.



Since you have read Macaulay's Minute in full, you can see that he has not said anything about what kind of school syllabus should be prescribed. The very nature of what kind of education - modern knowledge of Europe vs traditional shastras of the Indians - was under debate in Macaulay's Minute and the stage of deciding what should be the school syllabus was still far in the distant future. The Minute also speaks of the need to develop vernacular languages so that they could become vehicles of carrying modern thought to the masses. Prior to that,vernacularshad been totally neglectedbecause for the learnedBrahmans knowledge was onlywhatwas taught through the six shastras and the like and that too, in Sanskrit. Overshadowed by Sanskrit, the vernaculars were not allowed to grow.



I do not know about other languages but I can speak with some confidence about Marathi. I have beenresearchingthe topic of the Marathi-English Dictionary of Molesworth-Candy, first compiled in 1831. What I write below has been gathered as a part of that research.



The Peshwas annually distributed large amounts toBrahmans as 'Dakshina' in the month of Shravan each year, for which Brahmans used to gather in Poona for as far away as modern Tamil Nadu. This occasion was called the Ramana. (I have described it in some detail in an earlier posting ofFebruary11, 2011 in this Group.-[https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topicsearchin/samskrita/Ramanbag/samskrita/vYu70K_sRQc](http://www.rediffmail.com/cgi-bin/red.cgi?account_type=1&red=https%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%2Fforum%2F%3Fhl%3Den%26amp%3Bfromgroups%3D%23%21topicsearchin%2Fsamskrita%2FRamanbag%2Fsamskrita%2FvYu70K_sRQc&isImage=0&BlockImage=0&rediffng=0))
 After the replacement of the Peshwa rule by the British, the annual distribution of Dakshina was stopped and replaced by the establishment of a college called the Hindu College in 1821. The teaching in this College was of the traditional type of Nyaya, Tarka, Mimansa, Vyakarana, Alankar etc. and learned Shastris were appointed to teach these.
Scholarships were given to the students and the College was open only toBrahmans. This measure wascalculatedto pacify the influential Brahman lobby and to reconcile them to the new regime.



At this stage three different groups were interested inpromotingthe vernacular Marathi as a language capable of supporting translations of works from Europe. Theadministratorswanted to promote it as a medium of instruction to build up a class of natives to hold positions in the middle and lower ranks of their state apparatus of this vast country.
The liberal thinkers like Burke and Mill wanted to bring the new and modern knowledge developed in Europe to the Indian masses. The missionaries wanted to convert the natives to their religion.



Till that time Marathi totally lacked the essentials of a modern language like a standardized style of writing prose, a grammar or a dictionary. The first Marathi grammar was composed by the famous Rev William Carey in Serampor in Bengal. Later Brahimns of Poona started composing grammars of Marathi from 1830 onwards. Molesworth and the Candy brothers, all young militaryofficers, had learnt Marathi and Hindustanee as a part of their job but became such keen students of Marathi that they voluntarily gave up military careers and composed the first Marathi dictionary in 1831. (The Dictionaryunderwenta substantial revision in 1857. It went out of print by 1870 and has been reissued from 1975 and many reprints have followed thereafter. It is still considered a standard.



Molesworth went back to England in 1837 but Thomas Candy was appointed as the Superintendent of the Poona College in 1837. The College itself was reformed. In addition to Sanskrit and the traditional learning, English, and Marathi were added as subjects.  Admission to the College was opened to all castes and religions. In addition to the College, Candy also held the positions of the Superintendent of the Vernacular Schools in the Deccan part of the Bombay Presidency and of the Head of the Society formed to make translations from English books and to create textbooks in Marathi. Most of the Marathi books of those days were crafted under his active supervision and his word was considered the last word in matters of style, vocabulary and grammar. Several accounts written by those who worked under him exist and they all are full of praise for his devotion to Marathi and his mastery over it. It is generally considered that today's Marathi is the product of his efforts. Candy had developed such affection for Marathi and its speakers that he continued till the very end of his life as the Marathi Translator to the Government. After he came out to India as a young man of 16 in the year 1819, he went back to England only once, for 15 months, in 1855-56. All the rest of life was spent in India. He died in Mahabalehwar in 1877 at the age of 72.



The purpose of wring this somewhat long post is to illustrate just onebenefitflowing out of the enlightened liberal though in England, of which the Minute of Macaulay was a manifestation.



I have already said that in the Minute Macaulay has used some uncharitable language about thetraditionalleaning of the Hindus. It has given a convenient stick to some who would harp only on that!  I would look at the Minute as a whole and see whether its fallout was of net benefit toIndia or not.
