If you have not read my previous email in this thread, I would encourage you to do so for context.  
  
As the importance to English grew stronger in administrative circles, language of education became a more pressing concern. At that point, there were as many voices for English, as there were for Sanskrit or Arabic. Some English Sanskritists like Wilson and Prinsep spoke for Sanskrit. Thus "which knowledge is best worth knowing?" was the question that confronted Macaulay. He confesses honestly that he has no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic.  
  
That is how we get to the Minute in question -- someone making a call on which language should be taught when he knew only one language.  
  
The way he justified this stand was by reasoning that students who wanted to learn English were willing to pay the Brits, whereas it was clearly not true in the case of those who wanted to learn Sanskrit. So the "state of the market" was his "decisive test."  
  
The minute was certainly not the first serious challenge to then British policy. Previously, the evangelical Grant criticized Hastings plan of Indian education resulted in making Indians "useless and miserable." Grant's hostility to Indian languages and Hinduism perhaps surpasses that of Macaulay significantly.  
  
As in the case of the Sanskrit college that Ram Mohan Roy opposed, the question that many Brits raised was why should the government pay for an education program of "a laborious study of Sanskrit" instead supporting an education program that would teach Indians "English grammar, Hume's History of England .. and the Moral Precepts of the Gospel".  
  
So this is the background to Macaulay's minute which recommended the abolition of Sanskrit (and Arabic) colleges, and the wholesale adoption of English.  
  
Macaulay's minute did not go unchallenged, but the challenges became footnotes in history. The minute ensured that the mathematics and astronomy of Aryabhatta or Lilavati of Bhaskara or the many works of Kerala school of mathematics would disappear from Indian schools. Students of philosophy in India would go on to read Western philosophy and not Mimamsa or Nyaya or Vedanta.  
  
In the next email, I intend to go into the minute.
