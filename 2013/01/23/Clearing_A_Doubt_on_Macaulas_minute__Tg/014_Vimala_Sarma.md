I believe your summary of what to discuss and not what discuss together with your own opinions (I know you think these are unbiased) constrain the discussion, so it is a good idea to end this thread. See my comments below. Whe one comments on a position it does not necessarily follow that the poster is taking the diametrically opposite view - just giving more thoughts.

Anyway I have said all I want to say on this topic so will not be posting any more under this thread.

Thanks for your considered thoughts and all the work you have done on this thread.

**Subject:** Re: \[Samskrita\] Re: Clearing A Doubt on Macaula's 'minute'



Having seen the background in which Macaulay's minute came about, let us now look at the document in question. The intention of the post is to simply and explicitly state what one believes when one subscribes to the minute.  

  
Of the 36 paraphraphs in the minute, some are merely procedural and thus not relevant to the present discussion. The summary below covers most of the paragraphs - a couple of paragraphs in the middle were omitted because the same points are made elsewhere.  
  
So what does one believe when one agrees with the minute?  
  
(1) (Para 2) That one studying Sanskrit is doing the same as someone who is meant "... to give years to the study of hieroglyphics, to search into all the doctrines disguised under the fable of Osiris ..." This comparison was apt in his mind because "...Hindus (studied) all uses of kusha grass, and all mysteries of absorption into the Diety."  
  

\(2\) (Para 3, 6, 7) That "this lakh of rupees is set apart not only for "reviving literature in India, but for the introduction and promotion of sciences ..." (Para 3). In other words, there is no knowledge worth in practice otherwise*** ***Money as a motivating factor for the government is stated several times. The (paraphrased) refrain is that why should the British pay for Sanskrit studies when they could pay English departments***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(no he says that Indians would pay them to be taught English) ?  

  
(3) (Para 4) Retaining Sanskrit is simply because one does not want change. (Having brushed aside any other possible reason, the only other reason one could have for Sanskrit is tradition. That alone cannot be a good reason for retention.) purANam ityeva na sAdhu sarvam ..  
  

\(4\) (Para 8, 13, 18) That "the dialects commonly spoken among the natives of this part of India contain neither literary nor scientific information, and are moreover so poor and rude that, until they are enriched from some other quarter, it will not be easy to translate any valuable work into them.." So not only is Sanskrit devoid of any useful or noteworthy literary work***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***( he mentioned only dialects here - not Sanskrit), so are all other Indian languages. Several paragraphs make similar points.  
  
(5) (Para 10) That one self-admittedly no knowledge of Sanskrit nevertheless deemed it devoid of any knowledge***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(He says elsewhere that he tried to find out as much as he could about Sanskrit and maybe he was thinking about factual information here). That " a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia." And that "the intrinsic superiority of the Western literature is admitted."  
  
(6) (Para 12) That the "most profound speculations on metaphysics, morals, government, jurisprudence, trade .. " is to be found in English. And that English is the language used "by the ruling class. .. likely to become the language of commerce throughtout the seas of the East."***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***He was right!  
  
(7) (Para 19, 20, 21, 23) That it is a bad idea to pay stipend. And that it is a bad idea to study for long years. I am sure scores of students receiving scholarships and assistanships today would disagree. ***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(This was in the context of after paying stipend the students of Sanskrit could not get jobs and asked the Government for continuued monetry support - he wa not talking about all scholarships - there were plently of scholarships also given t to needy children to attend English schools.

  
  
(8) (Para 24) That money spent to Sanskrit and Arabic colleges were equivalent to "bounty money."  
  
(9) (Para 31) That "we" (the government) " shall always abstain, from giving any public encouragement to those who are engaged in the work of converting the natives to Christianity " and that "we" will teach the natives to move beyond false superstition.  
  
  
With this and the background discussed in the previous emails, a few comments are in order:  

If you do not consider \*most\* of the stated positions above either odious or simply ignorant, and/or you see merit in defending indefensible statements using reasoning that can, at best, be described awkward, then all one can say is that you are entitled to your beliefs, however unsupported by facts they may be***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(Surely this will close off any discussion!!) .  
  
For example, the claim that read "as a whole" there is nothing wrong with the minute***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(Did anyone claim that ther was nothing wrong with the minute - I can't recall doing so. Or that the statement " a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia" merits serious defense. Given the number of mis-statements, I do not understand how "as a whole" the document is right***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(It is not a case of being right or wrong - but the overall decision to chose English was borne out subsequenly as being the correct one.  
  
Then there have been repeated questions raised about unbiasedness of surveys and so on (which is a good thing). But it is surely intellectually dishonest to cry that whatever quoted source is unbiased, while thoroughly believing the position of someone who proudly admitted to his ignorance of Sanskrit and Arabic and to the supposed "intrinsic superiority of Western literature." Even if one is to very charitably ignore his ignorance of Sanskrit (maybe he diligently studied translations), how can his position be unbiased when there he makes an "intrinsic" claim of superiority***\[Vimala Sarma - did amyone say he was unbiased. He makes the claim of superiority for English not for himself ?***?  
  
Further, another line of reasoning offered in defense of Macaulay is that the recedivist Brahmanas, medieval conquerors or devadatta and his brother caused the decline of Sanskrit studies. And that Macaulay only brought light. ***\[Vimala Sarma - Did anyone say Macaulay brought only brought light? He was neither a messiah nor a demon. I said he was a product of his background and education.\] ***(Yes, there are many reasons - but surely, Macaulay's policies are not blameless!  
  
To that, one hears - so what? So what if he was to blame? He brought English which has been a great benefit to India (and I am saying that quite plainly). So we should just move on. I have nothing against moving on - and one must. But one must know what one is moving away from. Whatever we are moving away from is not from some imagined past where everything was hunky-dory or from some past where medieval Indians were steeped in darkness only to be rescued by Macaulay **** . Terrible social practices and architectural and economic activity at the time contradict both views. ***\[Vimala Sarma\] ***(Good summary ! Naresh Mahodaya!)

For now, move on, I shall. And address Sai's comments on trashy diversions soon.

Naresh
