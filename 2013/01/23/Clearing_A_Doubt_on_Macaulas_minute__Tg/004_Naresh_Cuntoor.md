Arvindji,  
  

It seems like you missed a couple of points I made in my previous posts -  
  

\- Re: your comment on "..any knowledge for that matter, has no nationality or 'ours and theirs'..." - this was not the mindset of Macaulay who championed "European science" and opined that there was no knowledge worth knowing in this part of the world. What is good for the goose, is good for gander too, isn't?  
  

\- Macaulay played an important part in changing the language landscape. But it was not a one-man effort as I explained. Some Brits and some Indians played their parts over the years. Macaulay was arguable the sAdhaka-tama in this.  
  

Now then,  

\- Let us assume for a minute that Indians in the few centuries following Bhaskara completely forgot about math (and related sciences) and that they were obsessed with nyaaya, mimaamsa, etc. Then are suggesting some sort of dark ages in India where no technological advances were made? Could you substantiate such a claim?  
  

\- In the concluding paragraph, I used examples of Aryabhatta to Kerala school to suggest improvement in thought over the years - and not to suggest that any one of them got everything correctly which is what you seem to be criticizing. After all even Einstein didn't get everything right!  
  

\- Regarding Kerla school: if they were not widely known, does it mean that they did not invent the techniques? I certainly did not suggest at any point that Western academicians were not novel in contributions or discoveries. The world is indeed indebted to Gauss and Leibnitz, to Masson and Colebrooke, and so on. That does not mean that contributions of Panini or Bhaskara are any less noteworthy. It certainly does not mean that we should be content to know the Bhakara's work is recognized in "a different garb" as you put it.  
  

\- It is on the latter point where Macaulay bears responsibility. The decline in Sanskrit education meant that succeeding generations of students would not even learn about contributions. The argument "oh but why is that important? Let us just move on" is not intellectually satisfying. If "let's just move on" is the mantra, then why have history departments? Why name a law after X, Y or Z?  
  

\- And even in nyaaya and X or Y-vedanta, Indian philosophical contributions would be relegated to the margins. Would you sweep that under the rug of "a different garb" too?
