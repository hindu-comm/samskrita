The 'big picture question' that Minute was about was whether it would be better to educate Indians in English or in either Sanskrit or Arabic.
This was the question under consideration. Macaulay was batting for English because it would make all knowledge in the English language accessible - modern up-to-date knowledge, and the give Indians the tools for scientific inquiry and learning. History, geography. science, mathematics, economics, engineering, etc, etc - it was not just a language issue, but a knowledge issue. And Macaulay was a man of his times; he was a product of his own education and background. History has proven his decision to be the correct one. This made Indians on par with the Brits and everyone else in education and knowledge, and opened up the world to Indians. This was not a one-man idea. The majority of Brits, and middle-class Indians would have agreed with him at the time. There were many middle-class Indians who wanted to learn English, and pay for it, whereas as is seen in his minute the students which the British had given scholarships to (they had to pay them) to learn Sanskrit did not value it, because they could not get jobs. He made the remark about a shelf in an English library because he was thinking about factual information. You cannot turn to a Sanskrit book to find out Moscow is capital of Russia or the dates for Ming Dynasty in China, etc, etc.



If Sanskrit was chosen as the medium - yes we would know about Panini, Bhaskara, Sankara, Kalidasa etc. But how much relevance it is living in a modern world? Can we get by only knowing debates in philosophical schools? How could we possibly compete as a modern nation?
Unfortunately the decline of Sanskrit was in my view nothing to do with Macauley. He advocated the support of an institution teaching Sanskrit and a madrassa. The British supported and funded Sanskrit teaching. If Indians wanted Sanskrit to continue why did they not pay for teachers and schools to teach this language and keep it going. Economics of demand would be sufficient. There is nothing stopping students learning about Sanskrit contributions, except their own wishes.



Much as we all love the language, the 12-18th century Sanskrit scholars were all recidivists. They were all looking back - not forward or even to present circumstances. They were commenting, analysing, elaborating and clarifying, texts that were written a millennium before. They were brilliant in what they did. It seems that the height of thinking and scholarship in Sanskrit all happened from Vedic times to about 8th century. It really declined after that because they were no new codes of behaviour or sastras written which was more appropriate for the times, no history of contemporaneous events, no accumulation of new factual knowledge building on the old, in fact no forward progress.
This state of affairs has been commented upon by Professor Sheldon Pollock. While previous to this period, India had a parallel history with the West, after this point, Indian thought stultified while the West's took off.



It is indeed an indictment that we have to rely on British sources find about indigenous education and the Indians keep no records themselves.
It is easy to blame a particular group of people for all India's problems. It is easier than trying to analyse real causes. One result of Macaulay is that the decision to teach in English the medium of education carried through to all their colonies - including Malaysia, Africa etc. It was good decision for these countries as well.
