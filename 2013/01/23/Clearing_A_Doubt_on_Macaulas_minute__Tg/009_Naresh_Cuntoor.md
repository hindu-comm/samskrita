Vimalaji,  
  

I am deliberately not getting into the "big picture" question because issues are far too many. Answering the big picture question would require many a doctoral thesis. Some of such alternate hypothesizing will surely be लृङ्ing. At that point it becomes as much about opinions as anything else, and such discussion is in my opinion, not productive.  
  
Time and again, things like intellectual rigor and good methods of investigation have been raised in this and/or sister threads - and rightly so. Let us apply that same rigor when making a claim of "I don't find anything wrong with when read as a whole." So let us go through the minute without getting sidetracked.  
  

Yes, the history of colonialism made English a necessity. I am not denying that reality. Or even लृङ्ingly longing for a different world order. Should the necessity of English mean that Sanskrit be completely side-lined? Take this one step further. Why does one need to study other Indian languages? Get rid of them as well then. For everyday transactional knowledge, one picks up sufficient working knowledge without a formal study anyway.
