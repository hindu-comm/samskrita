vimalaA-varye,

  
  
"Much as we all love the language, the 12-18th century Sanskrit scholars were all recidivists."  
  

"It seems that the height of thinking and scholarship in Sanskrit all happened from Vedic times to about 8th century."  
  

Nice try. Now please substantiate these sweeping generalized statements. If you cannot substantiate it or cannot give actual references and examples, there is no point discussing further.  

  

Regards,  
Vasu Srinivasan
