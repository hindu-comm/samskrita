Mr Jay Dave/Mr Arvind Kolhotkar etc

  

I don't think that India would have been the worst, had the British and prior to that the Mughals, had not taken hold of our country.

Prior to their arrival, India was thriving in the world in all respects , in arts and culture, in health and wealth.  That was the main reason, the foreigners entered into our country and looted it umpteen times. 
The Britishers looted our culture too by tickling into our older

education system.  Our artecraft had been excellent, as we heard. 
The textile workers were so artistic that a 9- yards saree was packed into a match-box and presented to the British Queen.  No doubt, industrial revolution in the west has brought sophistication and

the bulk production of the things.  India would have developed much more had foreigners not entered in our country for ruling it.

The trade was there between the countries even earlier than their entry.


I am surprised to hear that in India, in olden days only Nyaya, Tarka, Mimamsa and Vyakarana were only taught.  What about Jyotisham,

Ayurveda, khagolasastrm, sastrachikitsa, samgeetam, sports etc. etc. 
Being Indians, let us not underestimate our capacities.

We are all learned people and expected to guide the younger generations for excellence in all their walks of life.  We have to take

the good things from others too to improve our knowledge.  Regards.
