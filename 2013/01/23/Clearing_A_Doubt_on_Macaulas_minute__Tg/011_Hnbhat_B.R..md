I think good and bad are two relative terms.

  

When call it is the the worse, we compare the previous experience we had with it and bad is worst conditions are compared to the "good" conditions we liked or experienced in the past or anticipate in the future.

  

There is no knowledge by itself as "good" or "bad". I am not interested in this biased discussion.

  

Just one question to Ramakrishnan. If we are taking good things from all walks of life, why this and other threads are considered as undermining the knowledge of East or West by the followers of each argument? Why not to take good results of any knowledge irrespective of its origin and refraining from blaming other for its success/failure?

  

And, it it time that makes the change in the course of life. No one can change it. This is considered as downwards, as already sung by Maharshi Vyasa himself:

  

अतिक्रान्तसुखाः कालाः प्रत्युपस्थितदारुणाः।

*श्वः श्वः पापीयदिवसाः*पृथिवी गतयौवना ॥01/119/007a  

  

Commentary:

  

*श्वः श्वः*प्रातः प्रातर्दिनाद्दिनं*पापीयदिवसाः*पापानां सम्बन्धिनः - पापिष्ठजनस्वामिका दिवसाः**...**  

  

  

By gone days are golden days and now coming days are worse ones with things making the path worse.

  

I am reminded by these threads of the same revival of thinking and it has not changed much traditionally as if he predicted British Empire.

  

And everybody forget,

  

ननु वक्तृविशेषनिःस्पृहा*गुणगृह्या वचने विपश्चितः*।। २.५A key note to scholars by the poets, to accept the good things in the words, irrespective of who have said it, by Bharavi, accredited with the title of master of meaningful words - "भारवेरर्थगौरवम्न्".

  

I don't know why it required Right Brothers to invent Aircraft, which was designed by the विमानशास्त्र of Bharadvaja? For Steam Engine by Jameswat, which could have been much earlier than Bharadvaja invented "Vimana"? and would have most probably invented by Indinans, much earlier than the advent of British Collonialism, the result of Renaiscance Period in the Europe? This is much later than the the Golden Age of India.

  

Better we can make use of the knowledge we have acquired than indulging in the discussions about the lost past knowledge and putting the blame on others for the loss, which had been a gradual process, as the quotation from Mahabharata makes it out.

  

This is my view on this and other related threads.
