Hi Learned sirs,  
  
I am looking for a private Sanskrit teacher who can teach me Sanskrit. I am a beginner, I have had Sanskrit classes as a kid, but never had a chance to learn it enough to be able to converse or write in Sanskrit, let alone read Sanskrit texts. I would greatly appreciate if someone can teach me Sanskrit, I can pay for their time. We can meet anywhere at scheduled times of convenience multiple times per week, If you can help me please feel free to reach me at g u d i m e t l a v \_\_\_at\_\_\_g ma il dot com.  
  
Regards,  
Venugopal Gudimetla
