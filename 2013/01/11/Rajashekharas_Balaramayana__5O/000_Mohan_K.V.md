Hello all,

  

I am looking for the Sanskrit original text of Rajashekhara's Balaramayana, and would be very grateful if any of you could please let me know where I could find a copy (preferably electronic). If there is any version that's in the public domain, that would be most wonderful.

  

Many thanks,

Mohan
