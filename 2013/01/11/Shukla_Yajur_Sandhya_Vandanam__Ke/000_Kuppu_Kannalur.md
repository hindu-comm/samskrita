Dear Respected learned members,  
  
Pranams  
  
I believe Sanskrit is a language which is to be worshipped and  
patronage continued with. I feel good being part of this group. There  
are a number of topics being discussed and expert opinion sort.  
  
can some one throw meaning of this Pravaram " Hope I got it right - "  
Chatur saagara paryantham, go brahmanebhyam subham bhavatu kasyapa  
aavatsara, nitruvedhi triya rishaya kasyapa sagothrasya katyanai  
sutra, sri shukla yajur vedantagate kanva sakhadhyaye kuppuswamy  
sharma aham bo abivadhaye".  
  
My another doubt is in the above context, which school should i follow  
for Amavasya Tarpanam " Bodhayana or Apasthamba Sootram"  
  
Kindly throw light on this. Would be grateful.  
  
Pranams  
Kuppu
