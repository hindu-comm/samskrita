Where did u get the word and please explain with reference to the context.

  

Out of context it may not mean anything than Six Linga-s.

  

It may one of the six of Sahasra Linga-s, or Panca Linga-s or Panca Bhuta Linga-s plus one Mahalinga.

  

In other Shastra or Tantra contexts it will have different meanings limited to the Text or Tantra or School.
