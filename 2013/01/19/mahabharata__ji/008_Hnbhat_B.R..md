"देवीं सरस्वतीं चैव" is the another reading, which is replies the objection on the other reading as व्यास himself asks to bow himself. From our standard, there is no problem if we read Mahabharata at all, bowing either Vyasa and Sarasvati, as both are higher than us in knowledge. And Nara, Arjuna, the dearest to Krishna who is Narayana himself. All are superior to me deserving worship.
