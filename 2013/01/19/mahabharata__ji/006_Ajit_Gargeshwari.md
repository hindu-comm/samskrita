The composer of this verse has offered salutations Naryana, Nara, Narottama, Devi, Saraswati and Vyasa and then has composed or retold the Jaya version of Mahabartha.  
  
Vyasa is a character and compiler of Mahabartha. In the story of Mahbaratha itself, the story is told and retold more than once by different sages. So when a different sages or Suta retells the story he is offering salutations to Vyasa.  
  
  
This is my view on the verse.
