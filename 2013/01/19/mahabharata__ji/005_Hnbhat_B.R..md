I think you have seen Mahabharata in Svarga and confirmed it. But Neelakantha didn't return from Swarga and so we could not confirm his words. So if one want to read as instructed by the verse, one has to go to Swarga only and could not read it here in this world.

  

Hence there is no other feed back possible on reading JAYA. For the wordS in the verse one can give any explanation found in the wide Sanskrit Literature and claim it is the meaning and not the one given by Neelakantha. Neelakantha has provided his own support for the explanation of Nara and Narayana.

  

I am no scholar at all. Thanks for your detailed explanation next to Madhvacharya, who wrote MahabharatatatparyaNirnaya and Neelakantha who wrote the commentary on the whole of Mahabharata.
