नारायणं नमस्कृत्य नरं चैव नरोत्त्तमम् /

देवीं सरस्वतीं व्यासं ततो जयमुदीरयेत् //



From the answers obtained from the

members I find that nara and narottama

refer to Arjuna only.



Now I proceed to the word jayam.



Jayam means Mahabharata.



Jayam means victory. Victory of good

over evil. The whole Mahabharata story

pertains to this.



According to Katapayaadi method jaya refers to 18.



Please read my separate postings on Katapayadi and

bhuta samkhya methods of denoting numbers.



To be continued.
