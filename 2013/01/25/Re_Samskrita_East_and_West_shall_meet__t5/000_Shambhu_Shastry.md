Dhaarmic values:  
  
I wish add that the certain sweeping phrases Vimalaji posited as Dhaarmic values/ideas are not necessarily so, for we see them in Dhaarmic persons, but they are also acted upon by (cunning) adhaarmic persons.  
  
We may look into the core features of saadhaaraNa (common base or global) Dharma and examine oneself, a person, a group, a society, or a civilization with reference to them to adjudge:  
  
dhr\`tih kSamaa damo-asteyam shaucham indriya nigrahah  
dheervidyaa satyam akrodho dashakam dharma lakSaNam - Manusmr\`ti 6-92  
  
Patanjali in his yoga sootra-s gives similar per-requisites for yoga samaadhi:  
  
tatra ahimsaa satya asteya brahmacharya aparigrahaa yamaah - yoga sootra 2-30  
(jaati desha kaala samaya anavachCHinnaaah saarvabhaumaa mahaavratam - yoga sootra 2-31)  
shaucha santosSa tapah svaadhyaayeshwarapraaNidhaanaani niyamaah - yoga sootra 2-32  
  
The yama-s are universal, to be used in our interactions with anybody and everybody. The niyama-s are for one's own well being. There is no peace in the mind, and therefore in the society, without these.  
  
Daily practicing the DharmalakSaNa-s or the yama-niyama-s constitutes Dhaarmic life. The outward behaviors Vimalaji noted spring out of these core Dhaarmic values. Unfortunately, these are hardly the West's civilization characteristics, and they are fast eroding in the East too.  
  
Any contrary value is adhaarmic: asatya, himsaa (vairabhaavam), anaasteya, parigraha, secular charya.  
  
kaNaada's definition of Dharma in his vaisheSika sootras is:  
  
yato-abhyudaya nihshreyasa siddhih sa dharmah - vaisheSikasootra 1-1-2  
  
That which yields material and spiritual attainments (of all) is Dharma. Thus, exclusivity or exploitation or wiping out the weak on the local through global scene is adhaarmic.  
  
Mahabhaarata's "dhaaraNaat dharamam iti aahuhu, dharmo dhaarayati prajaah" (Mahabharata 12-109-11) is consistent with this all-inclusive worldview of Dharma.  
  
Going by the core features of Dharma or the yama-niyama-s of yoga, many a Westerner may be Dhaarmic or Hindu in practice and theory. Yet the civilization he/she lives in is currently not so and, in my opinion, since the Roman days.
