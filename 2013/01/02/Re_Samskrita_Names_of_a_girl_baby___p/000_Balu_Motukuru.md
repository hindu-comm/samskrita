Dear learned members

  

I am in my starting stages of learning Sanskrit and I am quite enthusiastic about it. We are going to have a girl baby in probably 2-3 weeks from now (I stay in US so I get to know the gender!). We are in the process of selecting some names and I thought it would not be a bad idea to request the learned community to suggest some Sanskrit names for a girl.

My only intention would be to have a meaningful name and to have a shorter and easier name for pronunciation (2 to 3 letters in Sanskrit) so that they are called with the same name instead of short cuts.

  

I hope this exercise would also serve as a means of knowing what is the meaning of each name and how the word originated from the root word and derived its meaning. Hope this would be useful to others in the group as well.

  

Dhanyavaadaha

Balu.
