A quick note to explain why we chose to allow Macaulay and sister threads. Such topics keep popping up on the list quite often. More often than not, we simply disallow the discussion. But that invites further comments on how we allowed 'lies and half-truths' to stand. Think of the 2-3 threads as pressure valves. Even in these threads, we have been trying to keep the discussion focused as far as possible.  
  

I know many of you are not interested in these kinds of discussion. Please ignore the threads in question. These will not be never-ending threads, but will be closed in the not-too distant future.  
  

Later when such discussions come up, it will be much easier for us to point to these threads and reject rehashes.  
  

Please do not reply to this post on the list. If you have any questions or suggestions please write to us off-the list.  

  

Thanks,  

Naresh
