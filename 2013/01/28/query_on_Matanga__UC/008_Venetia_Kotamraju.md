Thank you to everyone who has responded. 

  

As R Subrahmanian has pointed out, the difficulty here for us is how can मातङ्गकन्या mean मतङ्गस्य कन्या? Just as पार्वतकन्या would have to mean daughter of Parvati (or just the daughter of someone descended from पर्वत, not पर्वत's daughter) so in this case I presume that मातङ्गकन्या would have to mean 'daughter of मतङ्ग’s offspring' or some such, ie: she is his grand-daughter or at least she cannot be his daughter. 

  

As a result of this difficulty we wondered if the use of मातङ्ग is not in fact a reference to the sage but rather to her status as daughter of a hunter. Is anyone aware of the goddess being depicted as such? Or can anyone explain to me how the phrase मातङ्गकन्या can in fact mean 'daughter of मतङ्ग’.

  

Thank you in advance for your help.
