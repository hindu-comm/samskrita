My respects to the knowledgeable members



More may be found on search. So Matanga, a candala, became Muni and after he became Muni, Matangi was born, to reconcile two versions.



In the compound word मातंगकन्या - मातंग should mean 'of or relating to मतंग’ just as ब्रह्मसूत्र भाष्यम् of Adi Sankara is known as शांकरभाष्यम् rather than शंकरभाष्यम्. I am not aware of grammatical rules. Adjectives and derivatives appear to take the वृद्धि substitute. e.g. गाणापत्यम्, कौमरम्, शाक्तम्, वैष्णवम्, शैवम् and सौर्यम्.

However, पर्वतम् the mountain, and the daughter is पार्वति or पर्वतराजकुमारि and not referred as पार्वतकुमरि.



With reverence
