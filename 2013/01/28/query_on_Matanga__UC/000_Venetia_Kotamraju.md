Namaste

  

In the Shyamala Dandaka there are several references to the goddess as

मातङ्गकन्या

मातङ्गी  

and so on. 

  

According to some interpretations this is because the goddess is the daughter of the sage मतङ्ग

but if that were the case then the first phrase above should be मतङ्गकन्या.

  

Others say that the term मातङ्ग

refers to her father who was from a traditional hunting tribe (mAtanga can mean hunter) and that by this is meant that the goddess is the daughter of a hunter and indeed a huntress in her own right.

  

Does anyone have any more information on either of these two interpretations, and/or any other possible interpretations for these terms in this particular stotra?

  

Thank you

Venetia
