There is no problem in interpreting the term as Paarvatii it is grammatically correct interpretation.

Please take maata"nga as adjective from tasyedam, matanga + a.n

Then take maata"ngakanyaa as a karmadhaaraya samasa and not .sa.s.thii [tatpuru.sa](http://tatpuru.sa). Kanyaa to be taken as not daughter but as a maiden.

maatan"ngii ceya.m kanyaa ca maata"ngakanyaa. Literally meaning the maiden who is of Mata"nga.

As an adjective, the base can stand for all three genders in a puurvanipaata of karmadhaaraya samaasa. Eg niiladuurvaa (niilaa ceya.m duurvaa ca) or the famous example of laguusiddhaantakaumudi (laghvii ceya.m siddhaantakaumudii ca)

Sorry I am traveling and emailing from iPad and cannot type Devanagari.
