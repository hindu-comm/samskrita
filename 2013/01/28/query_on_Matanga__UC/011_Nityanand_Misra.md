Another possible solution is

mata"ngasyeda.m maata"nga.m mata"ngakulamityartha.h  
a.n suffix from tasyedam need not be in the sense of progeny, it can be used in any associative sense.  
so with maata"nga meaning the family of mata"nga, we can have .sa.s.thii [tatpuru.sa](http://tatpuru.sa) samaasa with kanyaa  
maata"ngasya kanyaa, a daughter of the family of mata"nga

There may be other solutions maybe even a madhyamapadalopisamaasa
