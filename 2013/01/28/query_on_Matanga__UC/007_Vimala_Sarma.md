The first vowel is lenghtened to vriddhi in mAtanga - because we are making an derivative noun " pertaining to' or "of matanga" - it is a also for "offspring of" as in pArvat!- off-spring of the mountain.

"पर्वतराजकुमारि and not referred as पार्वतकुमरि".

Here it is not the patronymic - it is simply a compound "daughter of the king of the mountain". पार्वतकुमरि would be "daughter of pArvathI".
