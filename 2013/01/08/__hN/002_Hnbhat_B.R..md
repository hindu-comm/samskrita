Can you (or anyone else) give a brief about what this exam is?  

  

This is the final Examination conducted by Jagadguru of Shringeri himself, after finishing the study of prescribed texts for the course of study in any शास्त्र like अद्वैत in Vedanta, व्याकरण, मीमांसा and न्याय mainly consisting of syllabus enough to have thorough knowledge of the शास्त्र. The Entrance Examination at the end of the Center is conducted at the Center of this विद्वत्सभा at Rajmundri consisting of invited scholars for the viva of the the final semester Examination. After finishing passing the examination, he is directed to this महापरीक्षा which will approve him as the विद्वत् in the सदस् which is yearly conducted. For convenience, it is held simultaneously with the विद्वत्-s present in during the 14 day सदस्. Otherwise also would be conducted, by जगद्गुरु himself, with the आस्थानविद्वत्-s invited separately for the examination.

This is not for conferring any degree like the University Degrees, though the earlier Examinations are conducted in the same model both including written and viva examinations for each semesters. The syllabus is prescribed to cover the important texts in any शास्त्र to be learnt in each duration of semester. It is decided by the Examination Committee constituted for the purpose. This is conducted to ensure continuous provision of विद्वत्-s for the annual विद्वत्सदस् and no other purpose of conferring any Ph.D or any title as such.

The frequency is as said above, based on the number of students who complete of the prescribed earlier course at the time of this सदस् annually. It is not based on any prescribed percentage of marks, but thorough knowledge to satisfy the विद्वत्-s and the जगद्गुरु to the best of the candidate. If he cannot present any answers satisfactorily, he will have to appear again and again till he attains the proficiency to do so. If in the first time he manage to satisfy, he will be considered as the member of विद्वत्सदस् and will be eligible to participate in the सदस् every year.

I think this is a flat question. Their proficiency in the शास्त्र they have studied during the course, they have to prove. Any content or topic can be asked to be proved from any part of the texts prescribed for the शास्त्र.

This is not any Examination for any Degree of any University, but only to ensure the continuous supply of real विद्वत्-s for the सदस् so that the सदस् will be full always.



  

This is what I know of the Examination. Even regular विद्वत् members can take examinations in the शास्त्र other than that they are recognized for. One can take two or three or more examinations in different शास्त्र-s. There are many as the members in the सदस्. Normally they are limited to न्याय, मीमांसा, अद्वैत-वेदान्त and व्याकरण as the popular शास्त्र-s.

  



This is the the brief sketch of the महापरीक्षा in any शास्त्र qualifying the scholar to be a विद्वत् eligible for participation in the विद्वत्सदस् as popularly know महागणपतिवाक्यार्थसदस् which is conducted yearly beginning from the day of गणेशचतुर्थी every year.
