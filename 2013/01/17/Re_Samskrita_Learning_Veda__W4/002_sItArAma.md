Srikanth,

It depends upon where you live, if you have access to a veda pandit or gurukulam then ask them to teach whatever you want to learn. It should be fairly easy if you reside in India and if you are in USA then associate yourself with a local temple and usuallyprieststhere are very helpful in the matter as well.

Its Veda pundit's moral code that they do not charge fee for teaching Vedas. After learning you must give gurudakshina which also they would not demand.

Usually its not a good idea to learn from CD or any electronic media.

When I learned Sri and Purusha sukta from CD I felt pretty confident but later decided to ask a learnt veda pundit to teach me, I did not tell him that I learned these through CDs and believe me he found many mistakes in my recitation.

  

In short its my recommendation not to learn from electronic media, oraltraditionis the best.

  

Regards

Raama
