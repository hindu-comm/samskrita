From my personal experience, the "legitimacy" of veda ghosha happens only when getting diksha from guru. otherwise all chanting is "ineffective".

  

you can learn the veda suktas from several sources, but get diksha from a guru once.

  

basic suktam-s: no matter what, purusha suktam, sri suktam are "must". then there are several others depending guru diksha and tradition - manyu suktam, mantra pushpam, pavamana suktam, ambhrini suktam etc

  

i have also heard that without sandhyvandana, chanting veda/murti puja does not have effect.
