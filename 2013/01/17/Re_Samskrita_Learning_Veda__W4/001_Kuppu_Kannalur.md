Der Srikanth,  
  
Nothing can beat learning from the Guru himself. Learning through DVDs  
or other hear say formats is not recommended though by the scholars,  
as mistakes will happen thro such medium and one will find it  
difficult to correct the mistakes.  
  
Some are attempting to learn through skype mode from their teacher as well.  
  
regards  
Kuppu
