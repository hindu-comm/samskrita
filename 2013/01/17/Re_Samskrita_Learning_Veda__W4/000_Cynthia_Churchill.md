Namaskara.   
  
With the recitations you are doing in your home, you have already made more than a start!   
  
I have a number of recordings with repetitions for learning (see attached list) but I cannot offer them on the [www.chant-sanskrit.com](http://www.chant-sanskrit.com) website because I simply recorded them during our weekly Veda recitation class with Sree Aswath. If there is one you would like to study next, please let me know and I can make it available for temporary download. I can provide you with the text also for any of these.   
  
There are also several of these recordings that are chanted more slowly, with shorter phrases (see attached list).   
  
Best wishes,  
  
Cynthia M. Churchill, M.D.

Hi,  
  
In our home, we recite Vishnu, Lalitha Sahasranama, Raghu Veera Gadyam, Samkshepa Ramayana, Sri & Purusha Sukta etc. apart from doing regular Murthi Puja.  
  
I am curious, if it is possible to learn some basic portions of Veda. How to start learning Veda? Is there any DVD/CD/Online Resource teaching proper Vedic chanting?  
  
Learned members please help.  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
