TAD VIDDHI PRANIPATENA PARI PRASHNENA SEVAYA

UPADEKSHANTI TE JNANAM JNANINAH TATTVADARSHINAH

  

TAD VIJNARTHAM SA GURUMEVA ABHIGACHET

SAMITPANIH SHOTRIYAM BRAHMANISHTAM

  

These two verses one from Gita and other from Mundaka will convince you to study only under the tutelage of a Guru.

Understand "gurumeva abhigachet" study only through guru..

  

Shankara has commented on gita bhashya that he who has not studied under sampradaya should be considered as a fool, even if he is expert on the subjects(murkhavadeva )

  

So stop self study, but practice self after learning through guru.

Subramanya UH
