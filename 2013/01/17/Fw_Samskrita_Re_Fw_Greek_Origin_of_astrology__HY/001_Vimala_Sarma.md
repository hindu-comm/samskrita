"We have quite an extent of literature, traditionally claimed to have written much before Varaha Mihira;" Can you please give a date for the work of Varaha Mihira? Otherwise it is not possible to say what was written by the Greeks.

Thank you

Vimala

**Subject:** Re: Fw: \[Samskrita\] Re: Fw: Greek Origin of astrology



Let me first apologize for resurrecting an old thread; but i thought i have a valid reference to bring to your notice...



We do have references to "Adhika Maasam" in Rug Vedham; which implies that the Rug Vedhic people have known not only the lunar calendar but also the solar calendar (the "adhika maasam" is attributed to the sum of difference between solar year and lunar year for a period of three years, which will then be clubbed to form an additional month in the third year) and they knew very well how to balance between those two calendar systems. Of course, i could not find (yet) any direct reference to sidereal year though (a reference to sidereal year or raashis in Vedhas would settle for ever the dispute of indigenous development of this art/skill/science).



We have quite an extent of literature, traditionally claimed to have written much before Varaha Mihira; by Parashara, Jaimini, Bhrgu, etc. I don't think that one need to be reminded that Parashara is the father of Vyasa, who wrote Mahabharatham, and is traditionally said to have lived some 5000 years ago.



Further, his contemporary Kalidhasa wrote a couple of books on the same subject.

  
One may need to rethink if "Paulisa Sidhdhantham" means "Treatise of Paul or Pouloma" since we do have rushi named Pouloma. Similarly, "Romaka Sidhdhantham" -- should we treat it as "Doctrine of Romans" of "Treatise of Romaka muni"? (we do have rushi named Romaka during the Ramayana period. Likewise, "Yavana jaathaka" should be "Treatise by Yavanaachaarya" or the "Doctrineof Yavanaas"?



Those who talk about the Greek origins of astrology should quote the writings of Greek scholars before Varaha Mihira time. And how many books did they write and how many are survived?



It would also be interesting to know if Greeks had knowledge of astronomy during that time, and if they used the same names as we used for nine planets of the solar system. Any Greek writings on astronomy before the period of Varahamihira? Since both astrology and astronomy uses the same names for planets, these findings would serve a great clue to find if the Greeks knew the nine planets and if they did, then if they called those by the same names as we use. Indian writings on astronomy before the period of Varahamihira are well known and i guess need not be quoted.



I am not of the one who says everything originated in India; but this is a case that has very tough contention to accept who the originator was; perhaps the subject evolvedparalleland both co-operated each other to reach higher levels of achievement, we do not know as of now. We need a real, fact-based analysis rather than partial references that cannot go back beyond the colonial period.
