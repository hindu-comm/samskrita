Dear Sanskrit Scholars, I have been researching on the tools that were used to create sanskrit manuscripts, and I found, as you all may know, that the main materials used were birch bark or palm leaves. However, I have not been able to find out which tools they used to put the ink on these materials. I mean, did they use some kind of brush or pen?, or did they employ another tool? Are there references about this in some texts, or in archeological findings? Last question is, which minerals did they use to make the ink?  
  
I hope this set of questions will be of interest for the members of this group.  
  
Kind regards from Mexico
