Dear Roberto Garcia,

All the literature in olden days was written on palm leaves or bark of trees with the help of an iron or steel rod having a very fine spherical-type pointed edge to write on the leaf.  The leaves are fresh from the tree, not dried ones, to make the impression clear. 
That's what we heard from the elders.
