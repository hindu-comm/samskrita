Sanskrit never had a single script. The regional method of writing was used for Sanskrit as well (In most cases, the local script had the ability to express Sanskrit as well.)

  

This would give a wide range of answers depending upon the region and time. This would range from Iron Stylus in South India to Brush in Japan/Korea.

  

Any book on Indian palaeography should answer your questions.
