Sorry, the verse was 2.29  
  
Dear members  
  
I have a problem with the metric of a verse of the Gita.  
  
āścaryavat paśyati kaścid enam  
āścaryavad vadati tathaivam anyaḥ  
āścaryavac cainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti  
śrutvāpy enaṁ veda na caiva kaścit  
  
  

[TABLE]

  
Can anyone tell me in what Sastra can I get this meter?  
Am I doing something wrong?  
  
thanks
