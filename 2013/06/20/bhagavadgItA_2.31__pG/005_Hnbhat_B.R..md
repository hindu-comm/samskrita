Can anyone tell me in what Sastra can I get this meter?

I am not suggesting anything about the metrical problem. But to your question, you can refer to Kedarabhatta's Vrittaratnakara with any good commentary which explains some of the niceties of those broadly defined meters like Upajati, which does not necessarily follow the combination of the Indravajra and Upendravajra paada-s, but of any other meters combined form upjati class, This gives a broad spectrum of upajati, and many have been sampled in VS Apte's Sanskrit English Dictionary, in the Appendix of the revised Edition also. The commentaries give broad variety.
