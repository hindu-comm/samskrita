Anyhow I have not heard any आर्षप्रयोग in respect of meters, but only in respect of deviation from grammar it is considered as such.

  

If you are sure that you cannot find any possible combination, either in विषम, or सम or अर्धसम वृत्त varieties of formations of उपजाति
combination, you may call it as such. But I have not heard of such usage.

  

There is a saying:

  

अपि माषं मषं कुर्यात् छन्दोभङ्गं न कारयेत्\|\|

  

which means you may may even misspell some word to accommodate it in the metre, but never the violation of meter is to be done.

  

  

'अनन्तरोदीरितलक्ष्मभाजौ पादौ यदीयावुपजातयस्ताः।

इत्थं किलान्यास्वपि मिश्रितासु वदन्ति जातिष्विदमेव नाम।।

  

This is the guideline of Kedarabhatta.
