Samskrita once upon a time was a highly free language,often to put an  
idea in context metric and grammatical niceties were compromised.Such  
examples are innumerable in Samskrita literature before Kalidasa.An  
extra syllable or a syllable missing was never questioned.Even the  
Gayatri mantra is having a 7-8-8 pattern which doesn't keep up the  
metric requirement ! Some then make it 'vareNeeyam' to get 8  
syllables.In the Bhagavata such examples are  
there in good number.Sometimes I find modern Samskrita poets like R V  
Joshi ji,if I  
correctly remember,making such prayoga-s.  
The Gita verse in question is in upajaati metre with one quarter  
having 12 syllables.The last quarter could be 's'rutvaapyenaM veda na  
caiva KAS'CANA' to make it appear more symmetrical : 11 - 12 - 11 - 12  
!  
Kalidasa has made use of upajaati in a big way,perhaps the second most  
used metre by the great poet.Some one who has studied the metrical  
aspects can tell us if there is any deviation.  
Best regards,
