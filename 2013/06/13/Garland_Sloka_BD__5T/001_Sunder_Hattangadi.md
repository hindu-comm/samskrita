This is a verse from Mahabharata:  

  

Mahabharata 12:72:20  
  
Shanti Parva : Rajadharmanushasana parva : 20  
  
  
 mālā kāropamo rājan bhava māṅgārikopamaḥ \|  
 tathāyuktaś ciraṃ rāṣṭraṃ bhoktuṃ śakyasi pālayan \|\| 20 \|\|  

  

From Ch. 59 on, Bhishma advises Yudhishthira on the duties of a king.  

  

"...thus equipped you will for long be able to enjoy and protect your

  

kingdom...."  

  

  

  

Regards,  

  

sunder
