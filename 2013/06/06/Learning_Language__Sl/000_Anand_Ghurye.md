There are six ways of learning a language . These are not mutually exclusive . These are Terminology ( by which doctors learn greek and latin ) , Methodology ( by which draftsmen learn drawings and plans ) , Structure ( by which structural engineers learn ) , Etymology ( Trainers use this aspect ) , Going to the core of the language ( language scientists use this aspect ) and ritualistic learning ( by which school children learn the language ) . We can pick up the path of our liking and proceed on the same , others will soon be joining in .
