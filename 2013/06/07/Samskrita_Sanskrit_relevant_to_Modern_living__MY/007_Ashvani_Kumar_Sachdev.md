Dear Sanskrit-lovers,  

The Uttarakhand example is thought provoking where, despite governmental backing, Sanskrit has failed to rise to the status of a functional language.  

It appears to me that, if we were to make Sanskrit into a usable language, one single major step could be the elimination of the dual number (dvi-vachan) from daily use. This single step would have the following advantages:  

1\. It will remove a third of the conjugation and declination memorising (and retention) tasks.  

2\. It will bring Sanskrit closer to all other languages in the context of numbers (vachan) as no other Indian language has dvi-vachan.  

3\. As a result, assimilation by those who have cognitive bias towards only two numbers (ek-vachan and bahu-vachan) will become easier.  

Aside from this suggestion, it would be a pleasure to be a part of any initiative to serve the cause of Sanskrit.  

Submitted humbly by a Sanskrit student.  

Respectfully,  

Ashvani
