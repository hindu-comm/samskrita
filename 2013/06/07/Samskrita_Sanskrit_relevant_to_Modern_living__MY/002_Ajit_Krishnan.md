namaste,

  

Samskrita Bharati published small dictionaries many years ago (Angla-Samskrita-shabdakosha / Hindi-Samskrita-shabdakosha). I would expect every word from your initial list to be present in that publication. Aurobindo Ashram also had a publication (vyavaharika samskritam) with many interesting "modern" word lists.

  

  

\>to provide and standardize Sanskrit words

  

  

Samskrita Bharati publications (monthly sambhashana sandesha magazine as well as recent translations of many short-stories and novels) have contributed significantly to the creation of a very large lexicon of modern words and phrases suitable for modern life.

  

These words deserve greater "publicity". A dictionary created out of the modern words found in these publications would certainly be a wonderful pursuit. Samskrita Bharati is not some distant organization with extra time to devote to causes. Samskrita Bharati is you and me and everyone else who chooses to help. So, if there are folks willing to work on this, there is a lot that can be accomplished.I'm happy to work with others interested in this cause.

  

Note that I am \*not\* suggesting that we create new words or standardize words. We can start off simply by cataloging existing words found in SB publications. That, by itself, will probably address the most urgent need.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
