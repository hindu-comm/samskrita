namaste,

  

There is an existing effort ([spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de)) where one can lookup and add entries for modern life. It's already web based, and anyone can contribute. What I would like to do is entirely different.  

  

The problem with these word list efforts, is that most of us have no idea who came up with these words or how they came up with them. When I see the word "strawberry" translated as "तृणबदरम्" or "upload" translated as "उपरिकृतम्", I cringe a little.

  

Word creation should be done by scholars who really understand shabda-vyutpatti, and those who have put some thought into various ways of naming each item. It really requires a team of people.

  

Out of need, samskrita bharati has been informally engaged in this process, and the result is available as "sambhashana sandesha". i.e. in my mind, words that are used in sambhashana sandesha have gone through a basic vetting process. What I was suggesting was to simply catalog these words, along with these usages (i.e. just as the Apte dictionary gives suitable examples, so should this collection).

  

I am in no position to help create or judge created words. So, I leave that effort to others. All I can do is help catalog usages found in good publications.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
