Dear Dr Bhat,  
Samskrit has often been considered as a language of the elite.But it  
can't be denied that it had mass appeal throughout.Otherwise how come  
that all literature pertaining to sacred and profane aspects of life  
came to be written in Samskrit ? Brahmis,kshatriya-s and vaishya-s at  
least are seen speaking Samskrit in the drama-s since Bhasa's times  
which mirrors the real status of Samskrit among the common masses.  
The group or groups are trying to partly undo the injury done to  
Samskrit and her culture by the foreign invaders and rulers.Samskrit  
is the soul of India and it has the inherent strength and vision to  
lead India and the world ! Samskrit can see through our narrow  
chauvinisms.  
Warm regards,  
SMMishra
