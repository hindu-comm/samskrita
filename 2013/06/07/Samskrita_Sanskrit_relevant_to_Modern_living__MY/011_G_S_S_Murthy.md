I wonder if a collaborative effort to identify equivalent Sanskrit words( created or existing) for English words needed for the modern world could be done through a web based spread sheet. Someone who has the necessary technical expertise ( I do not have) to organize the scheme has to come forward. I am willing to supply a categorized list of English words. Others also could.

Regards

Murthy
