+1 Ajith.  

Every cook should not join in making the soup. It could turn out to be a disaster. There has to be several layers of discussions and vetting done by eminent scholars  

  

Kindly involve me too if someone are thinking of a word-building project.  

I am actively co-operating with SB, Bangalore in some of their projects.  

Also, am quite familiar with Google spreadsheets for using it as a collaborative word-list processor.  
  

Thanks,  

Viswam
