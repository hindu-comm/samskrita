Dear all,  
Is there any attempt by Samskrutabharati or DD or any of the many Sanskrit Universities to provide and standardize Sanskrit words equivalent to English words relevant to modern days? For example, we need words in Sanskrit for shirt, trousers, toothbrush, toothpaste, matchbox, torch, sofa, tumbler, ticket, taxi, airport, TV, bank etc. The list will indeed be very long.

1\. If any group is working or has finalized on this, it certainly needs greater publicity.

2\. If there is no group working on this it is indeed a pity and there is an urgency to start a project.

3\. If no university is interested in this, a web-based collaborative project could be launched by those interested.

I request comments/info from this scholarly group.  

Regards

Murthy
