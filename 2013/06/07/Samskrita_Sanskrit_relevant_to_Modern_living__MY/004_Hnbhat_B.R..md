I add only that there is no need for publicity if there is a genuine need for the public and the new inventions conducted using Sanskrit language, like the English, or Russian words will have their own currency in their nation. Otherwise, it would be only the need of a group interested in nationalizing Sanskrit Language, so far "considered as the language of the elite". Tamil standardized words buss, and almost all English and Sanskrit words, in Tamil, but I don't they think they are used or understood by the common people in their speech, using these English words, like buss, car, etc. or "vimana" for aero plane or use the newly coined words pokkuvarathu perundu (=busses) or similar words, translated from English, perundu nilayam (bus stand) etc. Any Tamil friend may feed back with my view and query.
