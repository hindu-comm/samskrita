Sir,  
  

One way of articulating the issue is if we have a common enemy , we all become one family and fight the common danger together or face the challenge together. There will be a time, when the national boundaries and maritime boundary line would become blurred, because mankind will encounter a common challenge at the rate we are digressing. Rational developmental economists would say, we are progressing. But beg to differ.  
  

To your question, the following quote in my considered view holds substance.  
  

Ayam Bandhuh Ayam nethi gananam laghu chetasam  

udhara charitanaam to vasudhaiva kutumbakam...  
  

for the mean minded and those who think small, the differentiation happens between he or she is my family or that person is not my family... for the broad minded the whole world is one big family.  
  

As families we encounter a problem with steadfast mind. Is nt it ?  
  

regards  

Kuppuswamy
