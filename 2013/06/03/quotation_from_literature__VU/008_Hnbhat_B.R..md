Here is the exact citation from the Vikisource Mahabharata:

  

1.  

    

2.  

    

    \`परैः परिभवे प्राप्ते वयं पञ्चोत्तरं शतम्। परस्परविरोधे तु वयं
    पञ्चैव ते शतम् ।।' 3-244-11a 3-244-11b.

    

    

      

    

    

    The version quoted by Shankar was included in one the lessons in one
    of the Sanskrit Readers for UP classes (long ago 1975-80) in Kerala
    exactly . I did not search for the source for the quotation as I
    take it may be taken from any editions familiar to the compilers of
    the text books. It may be found in the vaRiant versions in the
    Critical Edition.
