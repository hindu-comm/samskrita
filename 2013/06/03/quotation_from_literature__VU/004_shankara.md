Namaste,  
  
I have heard the following verse conveying a similar idea. It is said to be from Mahabharata. But, I could not locate it in the Mahabharata text.  
  
परस्परविवादे तु वयं पञ्च शतं च ते।  
अन्यैः सह विवादे तु वयं पञ्चोत्तरं शतम्॥

"When there is dispute between us (Kauravas & Pandavas), we are five and they are hundred. But, when there is a dispute or fight with others, we are hundred and five."  

  

Said by Yudhishthira to his brothers during their exile, when Duryodhana who visited Dvaita forest to humiliate the Pandavas was attacked by Gandharvas and was saved by Bheema and Arjuna.  

Story in detail can be read at the following webpage.
