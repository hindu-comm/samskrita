Bhat Sir,

  

Thanks for additional information. You are right about this story being included in Sanskrit text in Kerala high schools in 70s. I checked the critical edition of MB. It does not contain the verse in it main body, but it is there in foot notes with slight changes and a mention about variants. Attaching its image.



regards  
shankara
