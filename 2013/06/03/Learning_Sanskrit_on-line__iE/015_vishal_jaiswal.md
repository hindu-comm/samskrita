This has been on my mind for the last couple of years, and its time I  
laid out the outline for review.  
  
Please note that I thought of this approach with children in mind as the  
audience.  
I have not included the spoken or listening skills here - these have to  
be factored in.  
What I note here concerns the reading and writing skills.  
  
These are the components -  
  
1. A dictionary as the base (call it beginner or level one or core)  
which would have all the words that can be explained via illustrations.  
This is not restricted to just vocabulary, but also simple basic  
grammatical constructs.  
For grammar via pictures, see this link,  
<http://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/>  
  
2. Dictionaries for higher levels which would build on this first level  
by giving explanations and meanings in Sanskrit comprised of words from  
the lower levels - there must be no translation - it must be monolingual.  
Something similar to monolingual learner's dictionaries.  
An explanation for what should go inside such dictionaries is here,  
<http://www.antimoon.com/how/dictionary.htm>  
  
3. The most crucial scaffolding in the above has to be tons of  
simplified literature that provides the relevant context for imbibing  
and long term memory (again without translation). By simple, I really  
stress simple - no philosophy, psychology, complex literary prose or  
poetry, etc.  
If bringing out paper books is cost prohibitive, electronic works should  
suffice until that is possible.  
We need graded readers, magazines, etc.  
  
I suppose one can have artifacts related to multimedia and technology -  
but being old-fashioned, I am happy with just books for implementing the  
above.  
  
And finally - this might not be an approach that most adults would take  
for learning. I said this at the very beginning.  
  
Please share your thoughts, opinions, comments, criticisms & ideas.  
And specifically please provide input on how the listening and speaking  
skills would fit in the above framework (the where, when and how)  
  
I can give some time towards this. If others would like to chip in, and  
someone more well versed in Sanskrit can provide guidance, the above can  
slowly take concrete shape.
