The point is.. I suppose (Classical) Sanskrit was always learnt as an elite "second language". It surely wasn't picked up as a mother tongue at least for the past 2000 years. N. Indians had their Prakrits as the native language, and S. Indians had their own bunch as well.

  

So it always has been "taught" and "learnt".

  

I am not sure how Sanskrit was taught to the students in Ancient India. I assume it would have started with regional languages as the medium-of-instruction, progressing through complete immersion at the higher levels.

  

It would be nice if some one can point to any references to Sanskrit teaching in the literary works.
