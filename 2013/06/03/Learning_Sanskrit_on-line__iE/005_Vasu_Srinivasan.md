bhAShA-jnaanasya ekaH eva mukhya-mArgaH - saMbhAShaNam \| all other ways (translation, learn from grammar etc.) are like sidewalks.

  

samskrita-bharati's initial classes are all oriented towards saMbhAShaNam (conversation). i strongly suggest you check out any local classes, find people who converse in samskritam and speak, speak and speak in samskritam. nAnya panthA vidyate bhASha-jnAnAya \|

  

Grammar knowledge should be a by-product of conversation, not the other way around.

  

learning mother-tongue (or any language) as a child is different, because we are not afraid (or ashamed) of making mistakes at that age. But as grown up there is a fear of making mistakes. That should be overcome, the belief that "making mistakes is fine, it will be corrected in due course" should happen.
