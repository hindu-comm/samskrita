I think this is a much talked topic in different groups. Why Sanskrit Can't be learnt through English or should be learnt through Sanskrit "like mother tongue" (NOTE it is like mother tongue, and not as mother tongue, though many have for different reasons, have recorded Sanskrit as their mother tongue, for the last census, which took the count of languages one speaks.)

  

There are so many best teachers who learnt Sanskrit (not through Sanskrit, but through their teachers through their mother tongues) and they have generated a generation of best Sanskrit teachers and scholars. So it is a fishy statement that it cannot be learnt through another language and it has nothing to do with the expertise with language, as it depends on the practical exposure to the language (either in written or spoken form - the difference doesn't exist in the case of Sanskrit as a Classical Language vs. Vedic, and not spoken and written language). The expertise in speech is independent of its grammar, as it is on the orator's capacity to give lecture in any topic whether he is expertise in the subject or a general reader of the interested subject. (There is no such distinction in Sanskrit, as every thing written is covered by the Sanskrit Language, and subject is different from the language in which it is expressed, which only few make differentiation).

  

Being the real state of Sanskrit today, only wish to make it mother tongue or national language will remain a wish unless there is a need for it felt by the nation as a whole for it.
