I missed this topic.

  

First let me give my understanding of language as an human activity effective, but not the best means to express his ideas with others. Within the wider spectrum of language, not only a spoken language, but the languages used by used by the dumb people, has its own grammar and structure. Ignoring it is very funny element. when we learn a language, we use to acquire the structure itself and not the analytical units by languager acquisition which is a basic fact depending on the vocabulary and depth and scope of the network of the use of the specific language, technical or non-technical literary or spoken language or any language.

  

The scope and circumference of Sanskrit language is not limited to only spoken language, but extends even most complicated sciences too, than literary works Vedic language and classical language. How much can be structure of the set up structure can be acquired, depends on the motive of language learning. If it is limited up to ten days learning camp or one months' Sanskrit teachers training camp for the purpose, no need of grammar to learnt. Like learning words used for daily home needs (here it depends whether homely language is dependent on the language, say the native speakers use for their needs since they learn to speak, the language they acquire (note it is not learning, in the academic sense, which many forget during these discussions) by hearing the people immediately around him (i.e. mother, and then father and others in the household). Hence it is called mother tongue, and not father tongue, or grand father tongue. All other languages are learnt in sequence, after one acquires his mother language, by

comparing and contrasting it with the one he has already acquired.
Hence they are graded as second, third, and so on in acquisition and the efficiency in them depends on how much he is exposed to the language and not the method through which he "learns" or "acquires". Even staying in Tamilnadu, one can learn Tamil enough for speaking and enough to meet his every day needs with the people around whom he has to communicate. This is the limit of acquiring any "spoken language" (note the one which is used in every day life without which you cannot manage to meet your needs, is termed as spoken language and not any language a human being with faculty of speech can speak, either by learning or acquiring). This confusion between the two concepts is the main cause of dispute why Sanskrit cannot be learnt without grammar like any other spoken language in the world. But the one who learns to speak Tamil by residing in any region will have to learn grammar, if he is willing to understand from original work without any translation and saying Grammar is not needed to learn a language, won't help. He can speak even chennai tamil (chendamil), madhurai tamil or kovai tamil with variety of vocabulary and intonation depending on his capability to imitate what he hears and for which there is no need of learning grammar. Compare this with the learning of Sanskrit considering the motive in learning Sanskrit and continue the discussion.

  

I am not interfering in the pros and cons.
