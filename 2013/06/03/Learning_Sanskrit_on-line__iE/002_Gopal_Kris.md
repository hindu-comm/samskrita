Though Grammar may be necessary to learn the language well, but insisting on learning it may drive many from learning sanskrit

The new push now is to teach sanskrit with minimal grammar in the initial stage.

Certainly to converse in sanskrit (Sambhoshanam) one need not master Sanskrit Grammar.

  

There are several free on line courses available for the beginners.

I would advise that Mahendra explore these sites and learn it at his pace without any time frame work imposed on him.

  

<http://samskrittutorial.in/> This is new and very well organized.

  

<http://www.vedamu.org/PageViewerImage.aspx?DivId=1533> . (If you have difficulty in accessing it try <http://www.vedamu.org> and work your way to the sanskrit lessons.)

  

<http://www.chitrapurmath.net/sanskrit/step_by_step_level1.asp> (This is very extensive and well explained) It has 64 classes and has some grammar

  

<http://www.joglekar.com/joglekarfamily/Sanskrit/Sanskrit.asp> (This helps more with conversational samskritam)

  

<http://simplesanskrit.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/simple-sanskrit-lesson-1/> (This is good but also gives some grammar)

  

I hope that this gives you an introduction and get you involved in learning.

  

Also the Chinmaya Internattional foundattion offers both beginners and advanced sanskrit classes. They are good, but they are not free.

This link in the u tube has few lessons on early sanskrit (samboshana) based on the VCD tapes.

This link will open with a class by Dr.Viswas and on the right side you will see the links for other classes.

You can work your way from class 3-4 and up and above.

They are quite rudimentary but may help in refreshing, Not much grammer in this. Mostly teaches without grammar
