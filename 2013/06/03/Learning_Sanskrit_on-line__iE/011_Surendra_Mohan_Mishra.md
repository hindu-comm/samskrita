No doubt that learning Samskrit through other languages including  
foreign languages has produced many great scholars.Patanjali lays  
great stress on the actual use of the language,not to know the subject  
only through knowing the language.So also Bhartrihari emphasises on  
speaking the 'daivee vaak'.During 'Munitraya's times Samskrit was  
struggling to survive and flourish.  
Once in Kolkata a great scholar before an august audience started  
speaking in his native tongue.he was requested by the organizers to  
kindly speak in Samskrit as the audience was from all over India and  
they may miss the points.Consequently he switched over to Samskrit but  
with little success and fluency.Finally he returned to his native  
speech and concluded early.  
To know and comprehend and to make use of a language are two different  
aspects.Our young champions of the language should be proficient in  
both.I appreciate their zeal and commitment.Without making use of the  
language you can't reinvent and restructure it in contemporary  
times.If we fail to do this some among us will question the presence  
of Samskrit in the constitution along with other Indian languages as  
modern Indian languages.  
Knowing Samsrit thru other mediums is like a 'post-mortem'.If we think  
of Samskrit as 'anaadi-nidhanaa nityaa vaak' we have to make great use  
of it in speaking and writing.We ought to remember Patanjali when he  
says : " yastu prayunkte kushalo visheshe shabdaan yathaavad  
vyavahaarakaale / so 'nantam aapnoti jayaM paratra vaagyogavid  
dUshyati caapashabdaiH // "  
In CBSE syllabus Samskrit is the projected medium for  
teaching/learning and examinations up to 12th class.After that what  
happens in graduate and post-graduate studies in different states is  
well known.All languages including English are used as the  
mediums.This is where Samskrit is sacrificed at the altar of our love  
of comfortable ease and complacence !  
Samskrit is used as cent per cent medium in traditional Samskrit  
institutions.In college and university education Samskrit should  
recover at least up to more than 50% of the space as a medium of  
teaching/learning of Samskrit.Otherwise we shall be producing students  
who will shy away from core Samskrit and shastra-s and will be mostly  
inimical to Samskrit in due course ! 'Champions of error' said  
Macaulay in a similar case for Sanskrit education.Such students,later  
scholars, will dissuade masses from the virtues of Samskrit.Let the  
best think and make the best possible !  
Best regards.
