Prof. R. N. Iyengar,

Greetings!

Sorry for joining in this thread many years after it was initiated. In case you are still in this group, is it possible for you to scan/photo the title page or first few pages of the book (where the author introduces himself) of this book? I have not found a copy of any other work of Sri Hayagriva Sastry (Bhagavatam) or his brother Sri Venkata Krishna Sastry except Hitopadesha on [archive.org](http://archive.org).
