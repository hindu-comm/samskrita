Sir, You can preserve the copy with Tirupathi Tirumala Devasthanam Library for digitalizing the copy. Also, you can contribute to Digital Library of India. I greatly appreciate if you can provide me a copy of the Mahabhart published by Puranam Hayagriva Shastry. ( Published in 1850 ).

Awaiting your reply.

Thanks
