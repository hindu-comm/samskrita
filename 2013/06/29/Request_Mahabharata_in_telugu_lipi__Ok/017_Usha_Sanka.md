I do not know how to get all 18 files one by one- they did not give any link- as "next, previous" etc.

Please see this-

<http://www.virtualvinodh.com/aksharamkh/aksharamukha-web.php?website=http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/unic/mbh01_sa.html&src=devanagari&tgt=telugu>  

  

Or just select Telugu from links above on this page.

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/unic/mbh01_sa.html>  

And then do same- as said in previous post. Change "mbh01" part in link to the number you need Eg.mbh01,mbh02,mbh03...mbh18
