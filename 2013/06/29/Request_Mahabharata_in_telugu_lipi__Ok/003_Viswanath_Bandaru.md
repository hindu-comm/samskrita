Respected Sir,

  

I am looking for either form. Thanks for the suggestions.

  

I think i will venture into the conversion idea. I also saw that we have itrans files on sanskrit documents site. It should be simpler for me to run itrans on them to produce telugu script.

  

Thank a lot for the suggestions,

  

vissu
