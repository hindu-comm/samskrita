Namaste Hanuman Sastryji

here is link to 18 volumes of Mahabhata

<https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8cMe7fL49e5UVgwZ0h4QU94Z0U&usp=sharing>  

  

When you click on each file a download button would appear at the bottom right corner.

You can download them to your computer and edit it, since the conversion was done using a computer program you might find some mistakes but that will surely reduce your effort to type.

  

If you would not download it then do let me know and I will send a mail with these files as attachment to your personal mail-ID

  

Please let me know if you have questions

Regards

Raama
