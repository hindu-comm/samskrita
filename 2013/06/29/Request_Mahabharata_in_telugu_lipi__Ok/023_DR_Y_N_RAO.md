Dear Shri Rama,  
  

I am a 80-year old Telugu-Speaking Linguist from Hyderabad (Telangana), India.  
  

Presently, I have been teaching the Divine Language - SANSKRIT since six years FREE OF COST through online(via.Internet) by conducting an e-mail - based Sanskrit Basics' Course titled 'LEARN SANSKRIT MODULES'. The Round-8 Batch has just started on 18th February, 2018 with 2,500+ enrollment!  
  

Now that there is a great demand for my above Course in Telugu Medium in Telugu Script, I am in search of a 'Tool' which gives the output into Telugu Script from my Sanskrit Modules in Devanaagarii Scipt.   
  

As such, I shall be highly grateful to you if you could share the unicode script convertor shared by Anunadji (mentioned by you in your reply to Mr. Sastry ji) with me.  
  

Awaiting your earliest possible response.  
  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
