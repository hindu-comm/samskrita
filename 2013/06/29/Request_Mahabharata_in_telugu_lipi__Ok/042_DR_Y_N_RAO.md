Dear Mr. Ken P:,  
  

I have tried the Sanskrikt99 to Unicode Converter the Link of which provided by you and is working well. Is there any facility to download it and work offline too? Please clarify.  
  

Further, is there any Converter which gives English Transliteration from Devanaagarii Unicode/Other Indian Languages Unicode? Kindly provide if you come across any.  
  

With best wishes,
