Respected Scholars,

  

I am looking for the Mahabharata in telugu lipi (not translated, sanskrit in telugu lipi). My searches on google have been in vain so far. My bookshop contacts have said that there is no such thing, atleast for all parvas.

  

I would be greatful if any of you could point me to any resource / link. Could you please help ?

  

I was told that the 'madras edition' was supposed to be in Telugu lipi with the nilakanthiya vyakhya. I couldn't find any so far.

  

Thanks

Vissu
