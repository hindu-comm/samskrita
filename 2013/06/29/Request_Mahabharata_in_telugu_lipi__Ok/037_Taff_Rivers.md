**Dr,**

  

I quote:

  

  "Presently I am using 'iTranslator99' of Omkarananda Ashram, Himalayas. Though it is giving correct English Transliteration and Devanaagarii outputs, since its output is not in UNICODE, I am facing lot of problem to convert the Devanaagarii input to other Indian languages' scripts!"

  

I cannot speak fortelugu, but as a beta tester for **Itranslator2003** (available from<https://omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/itranslator2003.htm>for nearly two decades).

  

Itranslator2003 supports unicode.

It also works on a desktop under Windows (e.g. 10 or 10pro) with no need to specify compatibility mode.  

  

Regards,

  

Taff Rivers
