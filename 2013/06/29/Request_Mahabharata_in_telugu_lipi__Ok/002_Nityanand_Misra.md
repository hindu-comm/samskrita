Are you looking for a digital form or book form?  
  
If a digital form then the text of Mahabharata is available in Devanagari on many sites including Wikisource (though with mistakes) and it is very easy to convert Devanari to and from Telugu script. I once wrote a simple sed script to convert between Nagari and Kannada scripts which is the fastest way.  
  
For a book form, you may want to check with some publishers.
