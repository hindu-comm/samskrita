I am not able to quite follow this discussion as it is not  
unidirectional. But I would like to summarize the various options  
known to me for getting Mahabharata in Telugu script-  
  
1) Use Asian_Script_Interchanger.html or [virtualvinodh.com](http://virtualvinodh.com) or  
Sanscript etc --> Copy the Devanagari text from some source and paste  
in the converter box and choose options to convert to telugu lipi and  
finally click at 'convert' to get the required output.  
  
2) Use BhaSha IME --> This can allow you to maintain the formatting  
while changing the script. Here you will have to go to Transliterate5  
where you will have to choose Uni Dev --> Uni Telugu Vedic for  
converting Devanagari to telugu.  
  
3) Use Foxreplace which is an add-on for Firefox. --> If you use this  
when you open any page of Mahabharata, it will show in Telugu script  
to you which can be read or copied. In firefox, you just tell which  
site(s) are to be 'operated on' by this converter. Here again,  
formatting is preserved. Useful for html pages.  
  
4) If Itranslator Sanskrit99 to Unicode Devanagari converter is  
needed, it is available.
