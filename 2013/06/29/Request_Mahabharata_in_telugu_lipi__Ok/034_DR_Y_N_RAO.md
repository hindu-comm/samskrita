Dear Mr. Ken P,  
  

SUPRABHAATAM!  
  

Sorry for my late response which is due to other preoccupations!  
  

I have tried the readmylanguage link. While it is functioning well ONLINE, it is asking for the Internet Connection when working OFFLINE!
And, the other links are not found to be suitable.  
  

Further, I shall be thankful to you if you could suggest any Free Website which gives correct English Transliteration from Devanaagarii (Sanskrit) Sentences, if any. Kindly advise.  
  

Presently I am using 'iTranslator99' of Omkarananda Ashram, Himalayas.
Though it is giving correct English Transliteration and Devanaagarii outputs, since its output is not in UNICODE, I am facing lot of problem to convert the Devanaagarii input to other Indian languages' scripts!  

  

With best wishes,  

--Dr. Y.N. RAO,
