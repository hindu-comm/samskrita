I am in the process of Transliterating the Vyasa Slokas in Telugu Script Manually, and in about two years (using my free time) I have come to end of Karna parva. I think at this pace, it may take another year or less for me to complete transliteration of only the 'moola slokas'. After many trials over net and when I could not get one in telugu script, I started up with this project my self.



I plan to go ahead with free translation of the slokas in the years to come.
