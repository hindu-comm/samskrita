MB in telugu script with Nilakantha's commentary was published c 1850 by puraaNam Hayagriva Shastry. I have a copy of this with me (needs preservation). I have used this extensively for my researches into dating of the MB astronomical statements. Shastry in his introduction says that he collected several versions from Varanasi and other places to prepare his edition of MB. More or less at the same time Vishnu purana (with sridhara and Vishnuchittiya) and Bhagavata were also published. I have these also from my grandfather's collection.
