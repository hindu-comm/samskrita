i thought i used the word with double quotes to show that it is not a sanskrit usage. but as a malayali we used that word and i somehow like this word. wheni saw a discussion on this word i was very happy..

I have not any objection if you are very very happy in using the word in your messages. But please take care to insert a proper subject line to the message to reflect the content of the topic as suggested by the moderator of the "samskrita" group.
