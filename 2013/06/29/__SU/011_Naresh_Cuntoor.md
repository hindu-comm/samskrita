Prabhaji, the difference in this case is that koTi is already a word in Samskrit. So 'kotanukoti' would be a distorted form at best.  
  

The examples you mentioned were not words in English before they were absorbed. As an aside, one does see examples of words from South Indian languages being absorbed into Samskrit.  
  

Also, putting on my moderator hat, I'll offer my 'kotanukoti' thanks if you specify an appropriate subject line the next time you start a new thread! :)  

Please don't leave the subject line blank.  

  

Thanks,  
Naresh
