It is not from ritusamhaara but from meghadutam  

  

कश्कित्कन्तविरहगुरुणा स्वाधिकारात्प्रमत्तः \|

शापेनास्तन्गमितमहिमा वर्षभोग्येन भर्तुः \|\|

यक्षश्चक्रे जनक तनया स्नान पुण्योदकेषु \|

स्निग्धच्छाया तरुषु वसतिं रामगिर्याश्रमेषु \|\|  

  

"A certain Yaksha banished for a year because of his misdeeds, from his master whose curse deprived him of his supernatural powers, for whom the separation from his beloved was unbear-able, made his dwelling among the hermitages on the mountain Ramagiri, whose waters were made holy by the daughter of Janaka by bathing in them and where the trees cast a deep and rich shade."
