i thought i used the word with double quotes to show that it is not a sanskrit usage. but as a malayali we used that word and i somehow like this word. wheni saw a discussion on this word i was very happy..  
next time i will be more careful. now again 'kotanukoti' thanks.  

we have a film song by srikumaran thampi in the film ganam. he has used this word more than once.
