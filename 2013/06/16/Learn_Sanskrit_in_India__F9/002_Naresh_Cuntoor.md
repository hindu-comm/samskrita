\[Mod. note\]  
  

There have been a few responses to this thread addressing everything but the poster's question - which is regarding places for studying Sanskrit in India. He wants to study the language for its literary content rather than its religious significance.  
  

All those tangential posts are being held in the moderation queue. Let us first see some posts which are on point, and we can worry about all things tangential later.
