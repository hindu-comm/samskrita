Dear Friends ,  
  
  

One of our regular contributors Mr. Shreepad Abhyankar , elaborated on the Relevance of Sanskrit in Today's Time for over two hours with an informative and impressive , powerpoint presentation . This was delivered as a public lecture where people from all age groups and categorization were amongst the listeners . Mr. Abhyankar had researched the topic well and put forth a number of examples from day to day life and from ancient times to recent past .  
  

In my opinion our group members will benefit greatly if he choo9ses to post a gist of his presentation and methodology on the group .  
  

Congratulations Mr. Abhyankar .  

  

  
  
  
Regards ,
