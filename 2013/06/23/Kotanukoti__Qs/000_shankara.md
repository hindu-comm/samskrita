Pranams to all,

  

I request Sanskrit scholars to explain if the phrase 'कोटानुकोटिः" is right as per Sanskrit grammar. I could not find this word in Sanskrit dictionaries of Apte & MW. It is widely used in Malayalam, Tamil and, I think, in Telugu too to mean 'very large quantity' like लक्षोपलक्षम्.  

  

Is कोटानुकोटिः used in Sanskrit? If so, how is the Samasa formed?  



regards  
shankara
