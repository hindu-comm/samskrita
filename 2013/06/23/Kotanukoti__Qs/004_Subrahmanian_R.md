Sirs, there are many such phrases used in Tamil with a Sanskrit color \[but not Sanskrit proper\] besides the above two - kotanukoti and lakshopalaksham. e.g. vArAvAram \[every week\] similar to Sanskrit vAramvAram \[everytime\], kAlAkAlam \[in right or appropriate time, like marriage of a girl in marriageable age\], veLAveLai \[velA Sans = time of the day\] in proper time \[as in 'to have food in proper time\] etc As Bhattji said, these are imitations of some other common Sanskrit phrase.
