Namaste.

There was some problem with my Java.

I re-installed it and that solved the problem.

The downloader was installed and now I am able to download books from DLI.

Thanks for all the patience and kindness shown.

I have another doubt.

By using the "search" option, which is great, I am able to find Sanskrit and English books alone.

I used to download Tamil books also. How to search for Tamil books?
