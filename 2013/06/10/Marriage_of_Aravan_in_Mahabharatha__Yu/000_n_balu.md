Dear Scholar friends,

I would like to read the original words of Krishna in Davanagiri when He takes a female form and marries Aravan , who wants to be married before sacrificing his life so that Pandavas would win the war. Krishna becomes a widow and mourns. A translation will also help.  
  
Thanks,  
Balu
