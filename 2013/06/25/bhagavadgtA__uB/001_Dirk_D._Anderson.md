Interesting topic. I assume this refers to variants in manuscripts? Unfortunately I have no expertise on that subject. However, those who may be bewildered regarding the numerous editions and translations I have a recommendation that I think at least Westerners may want to consider: Winthrop Sargeant's edition with forward by Christopher Chapple. Available Amazon.com et al. and receives highest reviews and ratings.

Outstanding forward and introduction setting the Gita in historical MahaBharat setting. Delineates and explains Sankhya and Yoga Philosophies with enough clarity to allow the student to follow those threads of thought throughout the Gita and gain an appreciation for those Philospohies at a earlier stage of developmentthat would later develop into Buddhism. Apparently, Sankhya and Buddhism develped parallel to and as rivals to the Kuru state and its highly complex system of Shrauta Ritual.

Sargeants edition contains: Devanagari Script, transliteration, translation, glossary, interesting foot notes, and just enough introductory material about Sanskrit to enable even a beginner to appreciate the language.

Sargeants edition is not perfect (type set could be larger); however, if I had to pick one Gita Edition...this is the one for me.
