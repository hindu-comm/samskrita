\> Apparently, Sankhya and Buddhism develped parallel to and as rivals to the Kuru state and its highly complex system of Shrauta Ritual.

  

Dear Dirk, could you provide some evidence of this claim?

  

Samkhya has been accepted as a Vedic darshana for as far back as we know. So we could take its reference from various Puranic texts. The Bhagavatam tells us that Kardama Kapila was the founder of Samkhya.

  

Buddhist texts say that Gautama Buddha was Kapila in one of his past births. Your claim above seems related to this claim. If this claim is true, then was Buddha's message at variance with Kapila's? Why was it not accepted as a Vedic darshana?

  

Perhaps there is some politics here rather than real history. In one of the Pandita Sabhas, schools like Jaina and Bauddha had to "invent" the past-births theory in order to face critics who gave examples of past seekers proposing the very theories that Gautama Buddha and Mahavira Jaina were said to have "invented". Secondly, during the heyday of Buddhism, there were recorded attempts to rewrite Ramayana, Mahabharata and other Puranas in the image of Buddhism and Jainism. The Raghuvamsha was supposedly written by Kalidasa to give a proper reference to Rama's lineage so the Buddhist prakshiptas could be cross-checked.

  

So could it be that this claim of a Buddha-Kapila twinship (and drawing Sankhya in opposition to Vedic Shrauta) is a prakshipta claim?

  

Regards,

Carl
