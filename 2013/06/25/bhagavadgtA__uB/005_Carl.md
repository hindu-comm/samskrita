प्रिय अभ्यंकर महोदय,

  

रुचिकरोsस्ति स उल्लेखः । यदि सांख्यदर्शनस्य कालः त्रेतः तर्हि तस्य यज्ञविधिना सम्बन्धः निर्दिष्टः । श्रीमद्भागवतपुराणे एष उल्लेखः -

  

  कृते यद्ध्यायतो विष्णुं त्रेतायां यजतो मखैः

  द्वापरे परिचर्यायां कलौ तद्धरि-कीर्तनात् । (१२.३.५२)

  

स उल्लेखः विष्णुपुराणे बृहन्नारदीयपुराणे sपि लभ्यते ।

  

ततः साङ्ख्यः यज्ञविधेः भागोsस्तिीति मयावगतम् ।

  

**Dear Dirk,**

  

Much of this subject is also beyond my ken. But from the above it appears that Sankhya is intrinsically a part of the "ritual" aspect of Vedic Yajna correlating with Treta Yuga. If one represents the material "form/mass", the other represents the philosophical "significance". It appears that mass and significance together make for stable gain in spirituality.

  

If Buddhism bears similarities to Sankhya, it does not seem to mean that Sankhya evolved in parallel with it, but perhaps that pre-existing Sankhya principles were cannibalized and made useful in a different form with Buddhism, which came later. Meanwhile it may be possible that in Dwapara yuga, the understanding between the form and significance of Shrauta and the Sankhya dwindled as another form took its place, as per the above reference. Just my 2 cents.

  

सस्नेहं,

Carl
