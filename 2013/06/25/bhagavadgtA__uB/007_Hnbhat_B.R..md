Dear Karl and Mark,

  

I am not an expert either in Indology or Indian Literature or Philosophy. But the two streams of discussions on opinions could not be nullified by each other, because each base their perception differently.

  

Either you can accept and follow Indological discussions and explanations by Indological scholars or simply believe what Purana-s say without questioning them in turn and enjoy as Puranic belief. Either of the ways will give you the satisfaction if you follow consistently any authentic work.

  

Either can argue out simply to refute the others' view than to establishing anything of their own with their talent and intellect. Just like our friend has interpreted to his convenience, the Bhagavadgita line the five causes mentioned , सांख्ये कृतान्ते - which directly means in the doctrine of Sankhya, to Philosophy, made to mean at the end of कृत yuga, which has no bearing on the discussion in the Chapter at all, unless otherwise twisted.

  

And now accepting the Krita yuga or End of it, the age of Sankhya Philosophy as per Abhyankar and the second citation quoted by you goes again without much importance, where it is clearly mentioned*कृते यद्ध्यायतो विष्णुं त्रेतायां यजतो मखैः\|*

  द्वापरे परिचर्यायां कलौ तद्धरि-कीर्तनात् । (१२.३.५२)

Vedic rituals gained prevalance in Treta, in the second quarter of the verse, and before that there was no prime importance and gained in Treta itself. Now there is no question for discussion whether वैदिक दर्शन or अवैदिक दर्शन. Everything is proved by one's belief with all the testimony twisted to his advantage.

  

History on the other hand, a European concept dates from a date of Christ, either BC or AD and has nothing to do Veda-s or Purana-s, if we accept in the face of the discussion, Veda-s along with PurANa-s, Darshana-s, Dharmashastra and everything was created by ब्रह्म, the creator God as per the accounts of Purana-s at the beginning of each युग, or each कल्प which is also a mystic calculation beyond ephemeric chronology.

  

It is a fact that westerners surmise from the contents of the literature related for their study while there is no such limitation for Bhakti and can draw from anywhere anything to prove their Bhakti. If you follow European Chronology considering these works created by human beings like us at an age surmised from the text itself and the order of their composition is based on this chronology for their opinions. Now coming to the texts in question, Sankhya either the work of Kapila, called तत्त्वसमास which contains only 25 sUtra-s, or a versified version of it Sankhyakarika, of Ishvarakrishna, which are the basic texts available till now do not go back to the composition of

Veda-s and you can refer to the chronology in any History of Indian Philosophy by any reputed author. Or can be satisfied as the discussion about dates of composition itself useless, as per the Bhagavadgita itself:

  

कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो लोकान्समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः।

ऋतेऽपि त्वां न भविष्यन्ति सर्वे येऽवस्थिताः प्रत्यनीकेषु योधाः॥११- ३२॥  

  

God himself is the Time and Space, and that is beyond any mundane discussion as opined by our respected Scholar Abhyankar.

  

Choice is yours.
