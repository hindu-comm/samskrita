I should point out that I am a mere independent student of Sanskrit of about six years. I have never been to India. I personally have no economic, political, academic interests at all. I'm simply following a passion. I am completely aware of how vast this legacy is; and in addition, how historical fact, mythology, and beliefs are at times hopelessly intertwined.

I have been reviewing Lanmans Sanskrit Reader and Whitneys Grammar. I have been having good success locating places named in the Hitopadesha section of the reader and actually visiting these places on YouTube! et al. I believe that is how I found myself at this group, while researching an older post.

Therefore since my qualifications are limited, the subject vast, and open to considerable interpretation by those more learned than me, you most assuredly won't be satisfied by my answer!  
I for one would have no way of knowing if The Buddha was in fact a reincarnation of Kapila. Why Sankhya recognizes the authority of the Vedas (esp. Rig Veda) and Buddhism evidently does not, is an outstanding question, one I can't answer.

Frankly, I'm not familiar with some of the Literature you reference (will get to it, when I get to it). My limited understanding of Buddhism and Sankhya leads me to believe irrespective of Vedic authority that they are quite similar Philosophically and of possible similar origin.

On the other hand, although the "Vedic" Shrauta recognizes the Authority of the Veda ( it was, after allthe Kuru Shrauta state that compiled the Rig Veda in its present form) the beliefs of the Rig Vedic Aryans and "Vedic" Shrauta (formalized ritual has come to the fore) is like comparing apples and oranges in my opinion. Complicating things further, isthe so called "dark period" between the Kuru compilation of the Rig Veda and the transitional Yajur Veda (ritual dominates). Rig Veda and Yajur Veda are also "apples and oranges seems to me.

To answer your question, I don't know. However excepting for Vedic (esp. Rig Veda)authority Sankya and Buddhism seem to me much closer together than to the "Vedic" Shrauta Rituals of the Kuru State.

Although, I did not answer your question to anyones satisfaction...this is all food for thought!
