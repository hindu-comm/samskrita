Introduction and brief review by Nityānanda Miśra  

  

Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe'pāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ (English: *Deliberation on non-Pāṇinian usages in the Adhyatma Ramayana*) is a comprehensive Saṃskṛta essay (*Nibandha*) in around 50,000 words, authored in 1981 by my Gurudeva – Ācārya Giridharalāla Miśra Prajñācakṣu (known in his current Āśrama as Jagadguru Rāmanandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya). The work was spontaneously composed by Gurudeva and dictated over only 13 days in 1981. A disciple of Gurudeva, Dayashankar Pandey, was the scribe. The entire dictation was done without any book or references, with all the text of Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa, Aṣṭādhyāyī, Mahābhāṣya and many other works in the memory (Kaṇṭhastha) and all the Pāṇinian Prakriyās in the mind (Buddhistha). In the Upasaṃhāra, Gurudeva says

  

बुद्ध्या श्रीगुरुपादपद्मरजसा संशुद्धया सादरं

कृत्वा लेखकमाप्तशीलयशसं शिष्यं दयाशङ्करम्।

बालो नष्टविलोचनो गिरिधरः शब्दान् विभाव्याऽत्मना

बध्नाति स्म निबन्धमेतममलं तोषाय सीतापतेः॥

  

buddhyā śrīgurupādapadmarajasā saṃśuddhayā sādaraṃ

kṛtvā lekhakamāptaśīlayaśasaṃ śiṣyaṃ dayāśaṅkaram

bālo naṣṭavilocano giridharaḥ śabdān vibhāvyā'tmanā

badhnāti sma nibandhametamamalaṃ toṣāya sītāpateḥ

*

*“Making his disciple Dayashankar, endowed with moral conduct and fame, as the scribe, the child Giridhara, devoid of physical eyesight, after respectfully examining words with his intellect, made especially pure by the pollen from the lotus-feet of the revered Guru, composed this work for the pleasure of the Lord of Sītā.”* (Translation mine)

The work was then typed and presented as a doctoral thesis (Śodhaprabandha) at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, for which the degree of Vidyāvāridhi (Ph.D.) was conferred upon Gurudeva on October 24 1981. The thesis was reviewed by the Vaiyākaraṇa Mahākavi [Kālikāprasāda Śukla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalika_Prasad_Shukla), who wrote the following Mandākrāntā to describe it

  

शोधप्रबन्धपरिशीलनतः समन्तात्सञ्जायते मतमिदं मम युक्तियुक्तम्।

शोधप्रबन्धमकरन्दमधुव्रतोऽयं विद्वद्विमृग्यविरुदं लभतामिदानीम्॥

  

śodhaprabandhapariśīlanataḥ samantātsañjāyate matamidaṃ mama yuktiyuktam

śodhaprabandhamakarandamadhuvrato'yaṃ vidvadvimṛgyavirudaṃ labhatāmidānīm

  

*“My logical conclusion, that arises from having thoroughly examined the dissertation, is that he (Giridhar Mishra) is the bumblebee for the nectar of literary compositions for purification. May he now \[effortlessly\] obtain the praise and fame which is especially sought after by the learned.”* (Translation mine)

  

Due to lack of time and resources, the typed manuscript (replete with typographic errors as it was typed on a Remington Hindi typewriter) was never proofread, and the work remained unpublished for thirty years. Over late 2012 and early 2013, the [Parankusacar Institute of Vedic Studies](http://www.parankusa.org/) in Bangalore digitized the text, and Vedavāridhi Dr. Ramanujan of the institute (copied) personally proofread it. The text was then proofread, edited and referenced with citations by me, and the same is being released for free reading. On behalf of Gurudeva and Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas, I offer fervid thanks to Parankushachar Institute and Dr. Ramanujan for this invaluable help.  

  

The proofreaders and editor have tried their best to reconstruct the original text. If any mistakes have still crept in, I request readers to point them out so that I may correct them. A second edition of the work is planned sometime in 2014 after a round of proofreading with Gurudeva himself.

  

The work is divided into the following four parts -

  

Prastāvanā (Introduction)

  

The introduction begins with tracing the tradition of Vyākaraṇa. A wide range of topics are first covered like what is Veda, origin of Veda, Apauruṣeyatā of Veda, Vedatrayī and Vedacatuṣṭayī, Śruti and Veda, Lakṣaṇa of Vidhi and Niṣedha, relation between Śruti and Smṛti, five Sampradāyas based on Smṛtis, five types of Vaiṣṇava Upāsanā, Vedānta, Purāṇa, Itihāsa, fourteen Vidyās including six Darśanas, three types of Āgamas and two types of Mārgas, and the six Vedāṅgas - the chief amongst which is Vyākaraṇa. Next, the importance of Vyākaraṇa is stressed. The nine Vyākaraṇas are mentioned, following which some unique aspects of Pāṇini’s grammar are discussed. The terms Āpta and Śiṣṭa are defined, along with generic definitions of Śiṣṭaprayoga and Sādhutva, which are to be followed by Vyākaraṇa and not the other way round. Then Sādhutva is defined in the context of the Prakriyā of Pāṇini’s grammar. Deeper insights going beyond the realm of grammar are arrived at from some Sūtras of Pāṇini. The essay then delves on Sūtratva and Lakṣaṇa of six types of Sūtras and their interplay is explained with the comprehensive example of *iko yaṇaci* (6-1-77). This is followed by the position of works of Kātyāyana and Patañjali in the Vyākaraṇa tradition. Mahābhāṣya and its position is described in detail with examples. Then the Prakriyā and Darśana – the two eyes of the Vyākaraṇa tradition – are described with the works of both, and the philosophy of Vyākaraṇa tradition is compared with other Darśanas. Śābdbodha and Śakti are explained as per Vyākaraṇa. The relevance of Pāṇini’s grammar is discussed in the context of Rāmāyaṇa tradition, including the Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa. Some insights into the Rāmāyaṇa tradition from Pāṇini’s grammar are discussed, and all the fourteen Śivasūtras are then interpreted in the context of Rāmāyaṇa. The question of seemingly non-Pāṇinian usages in Śiṣṭaprayogas like those in Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa is raised. Gurudeva says that it is very much possible to explain all Śiṣṭaprayogas by Pāṇini’s grammar. After explaining the the relation between Vyākaraṇa and Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa, the latter work is described in some detail. Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa's origin, poetic features, Rasas, Nāyaka and its relevance and usefulness in the context of Rāmāyaṇa tradition is discussed. The work stresses that since both Pāṇini’s grammar and Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa come from Śiva (as traditionally believed), there must be consistency (Ekavākyatā) between the two. Gurudeva says that there are 700-odd usages that “appear to be non-Pāṇinian” in the Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa. Around half of these usages are examined and explained using the Pāṇinian Vyākaraṇa tradition (others being similar to those explained).

Chapter 1 - Sandhikārakasamāsaprakaraṇam

The first chapter is split into two parts and examines 140 sequential usages in the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam pertaining to Sandhi, Kāraka and Samāsa. It begins with an insightful grammatical explanation of the compound Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam. Quite often two or three solutions, and sometimes upto six or seven solutions in the Pāṇinian framework are given for the seemingly non-Pāṇinian forms.

  

Chapter 2 - Kṛttaddhitaprakaraṇam

The second chapter is also split into two parts and examines 90 sequential usages in the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam pertaining to Kṛt and Taddhita affixes. Again multiple Pāṇinian explanations are offered for many usages.

  

Chapter 3 - Dhātuprakaraṇam

The third chapter explains 134 sequential Tiṅanta usages in the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam. Mostly one and sometimes two or three explanations are offered for the usages.

  

Some unique features of the work

-   Pāṇinian explanations of 364 “seemingly non-Pāṇinian” usages using
    around 385 Pāṇini Sūtras, 18 Vārttikas and few other Kārikās,
    Niyamas, Paribhāṣās, Jñāpakas, Dyotakas -   More than 1650 citations from 65 works of diverse fields, and
    several more from oral traditions -   Śivasūtras explained in the context of Rāmāyaṇa (a Rāmāyaṇaparaka
    interpretation of each Śivasūtra)  
-   Hundreds of complete Pāṇinian Prakriyās, some abridged and some
    detailed -   Lucid explanations of complex grammatical concepts -   Vivid descriptions in poetic style, with some Daṇḍaka-style Samāsas
    formed from several hundreds of words compounded together. E.g. one
    Samāsa with more than 200 words reads
    पुरन्दर­त्रिपुर­हर­वसु­विरिञ्चि­पावक­पवमान­हिमभानु­चित्रभानु­कृशानु­निखिल­नक्षत्र­गण­सकल­सुरासुर­यक्ष­गन्धर्व­किन्नर­चारण­सिद्ध­साध्य­नर­नाग­लोक­पाल­नाक­पाल­काल­कराल­व्याल­माल­मौलि­सम्पूजित­पादारविन्द­लेखाधीश­मुकुटमणि­संलालित­चरण­सरोज­रजो­मकरन्द­त्रैलोक्य­लक्ष्मी­नवनलिन­ललित­लोचन­लसित­कमन­कटाक्ष­संवीक्षित­शुभेक्षित­भव्य­सौन्दर्य­सार­सर्वस्व­सकल­सुषमा­सार­भूत­मनोरम­सार्वभौम­शर्वरी­प्राण­वल्लभ­संव्रीडक­मदन­मान­पीडक­वदन­सरसीरुह­निसर्ग­निहित­सुधित­सुधा­माधुरीक­श्रीवत्स­लाञ्छन­शरच्छशाङ्कानन­मधुर­मन्द­स्मित­तुहिनांशु­दीधिति­विहित­प्रपन्न­हृदय­सरसी­कैरव­विकास­ललित­लीला­विलास­महा­लक्ष्मी­निवास­क्षीर­सागर­सम्मन्थन­सञ्जात­कण­संस्पर्श­भग्न­भक्त­भूरि­भव­भय­व्रण­पाणि­पल्लव­जगती­तल­पाथो­विप्लव­नाशित­प्रणिपात­क्लव­विरचित­गणिका­गजाजामिल­पङ्किल­पङ्क­कलङ्क­भव­विहित­भव­संस्तव­करुणार्णव­सकल­शरण्य­वरण्य­तरुणारुण­सरसिज­चरण­तरुण­तमाल­नील­सरसीरुह­मरकत­मणि­कालिन्दी­कीलाल­विनिन्दिक­भुवनाभि­राम­श्याम­शरीर­दामिनी­द्युति­विनिन्दक­संवीत­पीत­परिधान­म्लान­मदमत्त­मनोभव­धीर­मधु­कैटभ­नरक­मुर­प्रचुर­महासुर­भूरि­मद­गर्वित­गजेन्द्र­गण्डस्थल­विनिर्गत­शोणित­करकमल­कलित­कौमोदकी­धर­शङ्ख­चक्र­धर­कमल­कलिल­कमल­कर­केयूर­कुण्डल­कटक­वनमाला­नूपुरादि­भूषण­मण्डित­सकल­कला­कलाप­पण्डित­कमलामल­मुख­चन्द्र­चकोर­वैकुण्ठ­विहरण­परायण­नारायण­प्रभविष्णु­विष्णुः -   Didactic approach with many counter-questions and doubts raised by
    “nanu”, “na ca”, et cetera, and all of them resolved in favour of
    the proposed solutions -   Nyāya-styled Lakṣaṇas of many concepts, both grammatical and
    non-grammatical -   Vaiyākaraṇa Śābdabodhas of common terms (Śruti, Veda, Anuśāsana,
    Vyākaraṇa, et cetera) and involved grammatical usages (vāraṇārtha,
    karmamūlakasambandha, samāsa, śaiṣikaṣaṣṭhī, tatkaroti usage, tadiva
    ācarati usage, tiṅanta usage from a pacādyajantakvibanta nāmadhātu,
    ṇijanta usage, svārthaṇijanta usage, vartamānasāmīpya usage, et
    cetera) -   Critical insights into original verses of Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam using
    grammar. The work may be thought of as a mini-commentary on 366
    verses of the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam

Besides satisfying the Vyākaraṇa scholars and the connoisseurs of Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam, the work is very useful for those who are learning Pāṇinian Vyākaraṇa. Having acquired all my limited learning in Saṃskṛta grammar exclusively from Svādhyāya, I can personally attest to the extraordinary benefits the work offers for grammar students, especially those studying by Svādhyāya. Just like a picture is worth a thousand words, similarly a Prakriyā is worth the understanding of tens of Sūtras, a grammatical insight is worth tens of such Prakriyās, and a Śābdabodha is worth tens of such grammatical insights. The work being replete with Prakriyās, insights and Śābdabodhas, offers a rare source of learning for Pāṇinian Vyākaraṇa concepts.
