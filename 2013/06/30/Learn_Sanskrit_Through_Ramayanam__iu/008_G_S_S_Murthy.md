Yogavasishtha and Valmiki Ramayana are two different works and there cannot be any confusion on this point.

It is not clear to me What Jivadasji is referring to. If he is referring to my web site on Sanskrit, I am thankful to his remarks.

As regards transliteration my disapproval is the same as that of an Englishman's disapproval of writing English in Devanagari or for that matter Cyrillic or Arabic.I concede that Roman characters have an upper hand because of their ubiquity, especially in computer usage.

Murthy
