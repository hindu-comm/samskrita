While learning Sanskrit through Valmiki Ramayanam, it is important to be aware that non-paninian usages are galore in Valmiki.

  

**This is most interesting to me. I have been working for most of my life on a translation and analysis of mahA.rAmAyaNa-yoga.vAsiSTha, commonly known as "Yoga Vasishtha", or "The Supreme Yoga", in Swami Venkatesananda's beautiful abridgement. The YV is a sort of interjection into rAmAyaNa at the point when vizvAmitra seeks the 15-year=old rAma's aid in dealing with demons.**

**  After some decades of close study, I would say that the author (whoever s/he may be, if anybody: the Self alone; or present as vAlmIki; or, as I think, a school of bardic poets) is very Paninean. I notice that often the YV poet uses an obscure term, which Monier-Williams attributes to \_pAN.**

**  I'll be dealing with this question in the Introduction to my work.**

** I would be glad to have an example or two of exceptions.**

**At first glance, I find Simple Sanskrit to have an approach that is sensible to nuance; and that is rare in the books I studied--Antoine's English high-school typo-riddled Sanskrit series was my main crutch, and of course Coulson's Teach-Yourself.**

** The problem for me is that you seem to be militantly against transliteration; and in my world,**

**which includes the non-Eastern world, transliteration is indispensable. Because the text cannot be received without a Hindi font installed. You get only a series of empty boxes.**

** Of the transliteration systems, only three suggest themselves. IAST--with accent-marks--needs its own font: another series of empty boxes. ITRANS seems no longer supported by the Omkara Ashram; besides, it uses "\~", the tilde, which frustrates any attempt to alphabetize. Only HK, the Harvard-Kyooto (or as others call it, KH, Kyooto-Harvard) is any good. It transliterates perfectly. It produces a text that can be read aloud by a well-programmed Speech-Simulator. If you are the S-S, there are only a few things to learn. CAPS show the length of vowels, and the retroflex quality of consonants. \<z> is the palatal, \<S> the retroflex, and \<s> the dental sibilant. H is visarga. M is a final nasal.**

**You probably think that transliterations will promote cheating on the DN text, for those who have a DN font, and so get both. Well, it may be that they do not need the DN in this age of sarsvatI, the Info Age. Wherever I go, I see book stores closing. If you are looking for their audience, it is worldwide on the web.**

**Thanks for your beautiful work.**
