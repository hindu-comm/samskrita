hariH OM,  
  

 Inspired by Shri Shripad Abhyankar's Learn Sanskrit through Gita site, we have created a site on learning Sanskrit through Ramayanam. We dedicate it to the shriicharaNa of bhagavaan. It is a work in progress which will be updated often.  
  

 Please have a look at the site here:

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  


shrivathsa.
