hariH OM,  

shrii murthy,  
  

 is there a single book documenting the non-pANinian forms in the vAlmIki rAmAyaNam which you have come across? I will also be very grateful to you if you can send us/me a list of those usages which you think are un-pANinian (here or by personal mail).  
  
 I too came across non-pANinian usages, but they have been interpreted by TiikAkAras in the pANinian way, thereby making the words fit into pANinian framework. one of such interpretations i came across appears stretched (i am sure you know many of them, more on this in a personal mail if you are interested.)  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  


shrivathsa.
