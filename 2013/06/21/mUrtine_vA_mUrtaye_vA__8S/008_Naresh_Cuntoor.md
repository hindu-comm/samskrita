(At the outset, I should apologize for the tardy response. I am afraid that will continue this week because of travel).

I am not disagreeing, but it seems that you are missing my point. What we have are usages such as ramaNIyadehinam, saumyamurtine, etc. The grammarian is trying to explain these by means of grammatical principles in a system. (That the grammarian bothers with trying to justify prayoga in the case of shiShTas and not otherwise is parenthetical). Looking at usages which are not readily seen in say, the Paninian light, one needs a little bit more thought and kArikas, vArtikas, etc. That's fine. But the kArikas etc. are constructed by interpreting the shiShTa's prayoga in a certain sense. I'll elaborate with the examples quoted. I'll get back to this after a brief pause for a couple of questions.

Thank you for elaborating these. I don't have the text with me. So this helps. It seems that the matup is applied first (as Sri Bhat's earlier reply hinted). I say this because dehinaH is used as the uttarapadam here.  
  

Question: Is this ordering of matup and then samAsa characterized in the Paninian system, i.e., is there some antaranga-bahiranga principle here?  

  

Why is ramaNIya not approxiimately the same as sundara in the above vigrahas?  
  

Now, let's talk this word along with another word quoted, ghorarUpiNaH. In the same Adhyatma ramayana, one sees both ghorarUpINaH and ghorarUpAH as visheShaNas for rAkShasas. The latter is of course, straightforward bahuvrIhi. Now, is there nindA in one case and no nindA in another case? Ok. Perhaps in one case the poet really meant the nindA aspect, but did not in another verse. Does this mean that bahuvrIhi form cannot express nindA at all? Given how widely bahuvrIhi is seen, it would be difficult to accept that bahuvrIhi cannot be used in the case of nindA.  
  

Or, if we are to say that there is nindA in ghorarUpiNaH, but not in ghorarUpaaH, then isn't a vivakShA being attributed to this prayoga? That was the point I was trying to make.  
  

Tangentially, I don't think kamala / rAjIva example applies here because metaphors are always selectively applied in that not all properties are sought to be applied.
