The above statement is misleading. What you probably mean is "a specific Vivaksha" is being attributed. However even that doubt is without a basis.

  

There is no Shishta Prayoga without Vivaksha(s). Babies make sounds without Vivaksha, but not Shistas. If there is no Vivaksha, there would be no Vachana in the first place! Normally there is a specific Vivaksha associated with a Prayoga. In case of aद्वि/त्रिसन्धानकाव्य or श्लेष figure of speech there are multiple Vivakshas associated with a Prayoga.

  

Similarly, every interpretation ascribes a Vivaksha to a Prayoga. If it does not, it is not an interpretation.

  

Think of it as an encoder (Vivaksha -> speech) and decoder (speech -> meaning) in a communication channel. Both encoders and decoders need Vyakarana.
