You are mistaken in this context. The question of justifying a शिष्टप्रयोग arises only if it cannot be explained by the system (here, पाणिनि's grammar). The नियम is clear - न कर्मधारयान्मत्वर्थीयो बहुव्रीहिश्चेत्तदर्थ-प्रतिपत्ति-करः. I.e.  
  
IF the same intended meanining (विवक्षितार्थ) can be obtained by बहुव्रीहि compound  
THEN a कर्मधारय compound should not be followed by a मत्वर्थीयो suffix  
  
With the else clause, this reads  
  
IF the same intended meanining can be obtained by बहुव्रीहि compound  
THEN a कर्मधारय compound should not be followed by a मत्वर्थीय suffix  
ELSE a कर्मधारय may be followed by a मत्वर्थीय suffix  
  
रमणीयदेहिनम् can be parsed in multiple ways in Paninian system. In one of the valid parsings रमणीय + देह + णिनि there is a कर्मधारय is followed by a मत्वर्थीय suffix. This valid parsing of the शिष्टप्रयोग can is covered by the ELSE clause above, but not by the IF clause. If a case is covered by the ELSE clause, one cannot say it is non-Paninian simply because it is not covered by the stated IF clause. As per the ELSE clause, one concludes that the विवक्षितार्थ could not have been obtained by बहुव्रीहि, hence the नित्ययोग/प्राशस्त्य meaning.  
  
रमणीयदेहिनम् can also be explained in Paninian system as  
1. ‘रमणीयं देग्धुं तच्छीलः’ by 'सुप्यजातौ णिनिस्ताच्छील्ये' (3-2-78)  
2. ‘रमणीया देहिनो मत्स्यादयश्चतुर्विंशतिरवतारा यस्य स रमणीयदेही तं रमणीय-देहिनम्’।  
3. ‘रमणीया देहिनो जीवात्मानो यस्य स रमणीयदेही तम्’  
4. ‘रमणीयाः रमणशीला जीवात्मानो देहिनो मुक्त-नित्या यस्मिन् स रमणीयदेही तं रमणीय-देहिनम्’।  
All these are explained in अध्यात्मरामायणेऽपाणिनीयप्रयोगानां विमर्शः  
  
Nobody is forcing you to believe that the शिष्टप्रयोग can be explained by Paninian grammar. It may be explained by some other grammar system (ऐन्द्र/चान्द्र/कातन्त्र/हेम) in a different way. I cannot say about them as I have not studied them. But if we believe in Panini, this is the interpretation.  
  
As for रमणीयदेहिनं verses सुन्दरकायं, the meaning is different. रमणीय is not same as सुन्दर, देही is not same as काय, and रमणीयदेही is not same as सुन्दरकाय. In सुन्दरकाय there is no विवक्षा of नित्ययोग/प्राशस्त्य as per Paninian system. This does not mean सुन्दरकाय is not नित्य, only that nothing is said about its नित्यत्व. For example, the same Rama is called नवकमलदलस्वर्धिनेत्रं प्रसन्नं and also राजीवनेत्रं in the same Ramarakshastotra. So does that mean राजीवनेत्रं does implies that the eyes are like the withering (म्लान) lotus and not the blooming (नव) lotus? No. There is nothing said about the lotus's state (नव or म्लान), it is not in the विवक्षा.  
  
यथा सर्वाणि कारकानि विवक्षाधीनानि, एवमेव सर्वे प्रत्यया अपि विवक्षाधीनाः. The speaker assigns नित्ययोगत्व/नवत्व of कमल in one case as (s)he wants to emphasize it or speak about it. The speaker does not assign नित्ययोगत्व/नवत्व of कमल in the other case as (s)he does not want to speak about it (reason could be metre, विवक्षा or anything else).

I do not understand the question. Can you please quote the text here?
As far as चित्रगु is concerned, there is no मतुप् suffix involved.
