Other grammarians give only one answer that when there is karmāpekṣā in bhāve prayoga, then we can use karma. There is no other answer. I respect Panini's view on this, however other grammarians seem more logical and practical. Anyway it is again a sort of day-to-day fight between principles and practicality.  
  
I tried to search through some of the Purāṇas to give another ex., and I found one, however that can also be treated as a karmaṇi prayoga, as karma has neuter gender.  
  

Viṣṇu Purāṇa 5.19.11  
gantavyaṁ vasudevasya na bhavadbhyāṁ tathā gṛham
