Dear Prasad,

  

Please give reference to the सूत्र under which पुरुषोत्तमदेव illustrates the sentence alternatively for your quoted sentences and its justification therein. or any other authentic text "usig karma" in भावे प्रयोग.

  

As far as I know, I have not seen such usages. I cannot give any reference for your quoted sentences.

It the Panini's " लः कर्मणि भावे चाकर्मकेभ्यः" पा सू ३-४-६९ (लकाराः सकर्मकेभ्यः धातुभ्यः कर्मणि कर्तरि च भवन्ति अपि च अकर्मकेभ्यः धातुभ्यः कर्तरि भावे च भवन्ति इति सूत्रार्थः। ) rule that provides for भावे and कर्तरि प्रयोग for the अकर्मकधातु-s. This explains what I have said.

  

Now your turn to prove your reference with substantiating your view that the sentence can be correct according to Purushottamadeva's vritti or any वैदिक सूत्र of any other grammarian with the reference to the usage. If you have any doubt, please ask your doubt clearly and directly.
