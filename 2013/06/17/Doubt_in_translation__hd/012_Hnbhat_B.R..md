There is no reason why should be used in "bhāve prayoga" as per the rule according to Panini's rule when he clearly says "भावे चाकर्मकेभ्यः" पा सू ३-४-६" अकर्मक verbs do not have a "karma" demand "bhave" लकर and only सकर्मक-s require कर्मणि लकार in the सूत्र you have read and also in the काशिका thereon?

  

You have to give explanation in other grammarians' opinion which do not have any such distinction or rule. I can't give any because they go against Panini's rule which were justified by other grammarians.
