Can you give precise references for gamyate mayā grāmam and kāṁ diśaṁ gantavyam? Which works are these examples originally from?

  

If they are Vedic, they can be considered examples of liṅgavyatyaya and subvyatyaya respectively which is covered by Panini, e.g. see Kāśikā on 3-1-85. If not Vedic, then the first can be explained as Paninian karmaṇiprayoga by considering grāma in both neuter and masculine (some lexicons do that, e.g. Monier Williams on grāma) while the second can be explained as Paninian bhāveprayoga by resorting to adhyāhāra of "prati", "samayā", "nikaṣā" et cetera. Even without considering alternate genders or adhyāhāra, several alternate derivations and explanations can be given in the Paninian system. As for "gantavyaṁ vasudevasya na bhavadbhyāṁ tathā gṛham" from VP, "gṛham" is very well known to be both masculine and feminine so it is explained by Paninian system.

  

It has to be first conclusively proven that a usage is non-Paninian before we consider differences between Paninian and non-Paninian systems. You may find other grammarians logic better, but no other grammar is as encompassing as that of Panini. In statistical terms, Paninian model is the best to-date model with the highest explanatory power, so it does not matter if it differs with other models at some places.
