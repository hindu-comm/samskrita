Sorry, I found the source of your quotation, it is here:

  

सकर्मकाद्धातोर्भावेऽपि क्रियाव्याप्तिरस्ति। यथा। कां दिशं गन्तव्यम्। अवलम्बः *मुग्धबोधटीकायां दुर्गादासः*॥  

  

It becomes Apaniniya. Thanks for the information. But I could find any other usage similar to it. It is not any how general and is not accepted generally. Hope this explains the question and it is up to the user whether to follow Panini or Non-Paninian rare usage?
