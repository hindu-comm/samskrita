Dear All,  
  

When I had to translate the following sentence  
  

" I should follow the path followed by the great people"  
  

I came up with the following sentences.  
  
मया महतां पन्थाः अनुसरणीयः ।  
  
मया महतां पन्थानम् अनुसर्तव्यम् ।  
  

I am confident that the first translation is correct, but I am not sure about the second one. Can the learned scholars in the group tell me whether the second one is correct or wrong. If wrong the reasons for that.
