I may differ with Bhatji's opinion for the second sentence.  

  
Is it not the second sentence a bhāve prayoga? Even though Pāṇini didn't accept karma being used in bhāve prayoga, some of the early grammars accepted a place of karma in bhāve prayoga. Even we see usages in Bhāṣā-vṛtti, a commentary on Pāṇini's grammatical aphorisms excepting those which exclusively pertain to the Vedas by Puruṣottamadeva, as gamyate mayā grāmam OR kāṁ diśaṁ gantavyam.  
  
May be Bhat sir can correct me if I am wrong, giving me some reference.
