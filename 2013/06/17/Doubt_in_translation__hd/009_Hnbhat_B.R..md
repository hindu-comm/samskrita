The principle is simple. As far as possible, learn Sanskrit without emphasis on Paninian Grammar and any other grammar that facilitates learning, but Panini's which is considered to be avoided in teaching and learning. This has been discussed in another thread some time ago. Even learning conjugations of verbs in all the ten classes and in ten लकार-s are avoided preferring the participle forms, तव्यत, तव्य, क्त, क्तवतु, etc. and simple present tense conjugation of simple verbs. This tendency often gives many undesirable forms due to सेट् अनिट् variations ignored totally and many problems like this active and passive sentence structure.

  

Here is one earlier discussion why should I learn Vyakarana at all:

There are some more topics where the relevancy of Vyakarana in learning and teaching is discussed in our "samskrita" group. Right now I could not find all of them. The general tendency is to use as little of conjugated verbs and declensions of nouns to save effort in learning the conjugated forms and declensions or grammar.
