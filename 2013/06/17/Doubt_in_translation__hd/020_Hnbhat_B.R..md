It is not the question of the correctness of the two words or the grammatical status of the two words, अनुसर्तव्य AND अनुसरणीय, but the correctness of the second sentence structure. As I have already suggested, all the words in the second sentence are grammatically correct. But the sentence itself doesn't seem to be the correct one according to the Paninian system of grammar and this is being discussed throughout the topic.

  

Any suggestion on the correctness of the second sentence structure is welcome in addition to those already added which is asked for in the first message itself.
