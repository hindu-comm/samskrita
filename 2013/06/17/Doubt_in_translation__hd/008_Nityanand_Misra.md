Why this obsession with कर्मणिप्रयोग and तव्यत् / अनीयर्? You can very well useकर्तरि प्रयोग and तिङन्त.

  

अहं महात्मभिः अनुसृतं मार्गम् अनुसरेयम्  

Or with Samaasa and Sandhi and some reordering -

महात्मानुसृतमार्गमहमनुसरेयम्  

  

I feel sometimes Sanskrit learners avoid तिङन्त usage since तिङन्तप्रक्रिया is a bit involved. Even Sanskrit Bharati's spoken Sanskrit classes focus more on कृदन्त forms with कर्मणि प्रयोग to avoid तिङन्त usages. I think on the contrary we should promote usage of तिङन्त forms in learning, for it is one of the most important aspects of Sanskrit grammar.
