Thank you Bhat sir for giving me another reference.  
  
I totally agree with Bhat sir's opinion that karma being used in bhāve prayoga is a very rare instance. Generally other grammarians exercise that only when a bhāve prayoga sentence would seem incomplete without using a karma.  
  
Bhat sir, I read Kāśikā for Pāṇini 3.4.69, however, I did not find any explanation why karma should not be used in bhāve prayoga. Is there any other place where such explanation given?  
  

Thank you.
