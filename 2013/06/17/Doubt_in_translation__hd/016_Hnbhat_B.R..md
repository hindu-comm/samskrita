As for "gantavyaṁ vasudevasya na bhavadbhyāṁ tathā gṛham" from VP, "gṛham" is very well known to be both masculine and feminine so it is explained by Paninian system.

  

Sorry it should be in masculine and neuter gender.

  

******गृहं** गेहोदवसितंवेश्म सद्म निकेतनम्।।२-२-४।। निशान्तवस्त्यसदनं भवनागारमन्दिरम् ।

***गृहाः पुंसि च भूम्न्येव*** निकाय्यनिलयालयाः ।।२-२-५।।

  

Note in masculine it is used in plural only according to Amara. There may be rare usages in singular also, but that may be justified as archaic usage.

  

Here it is clearly Paninian usage as the word**गृहं** in the quoted line is in nominative, and not denotes "karma" as it is conveyed by the कृत्य suffix in गन्तव्यम्. "तयोरेव कृत्यक्तखलर्थाः"(३।४।७०) and the verbs of motion though "अकर्मक" the object of the verb, (indirect) is considered as कर्म.as per the maxim "

"अकर्मकधातुभिर्योगे देशः कालो भावो गन्तव्योऽध्वा चकर्मसंज्ञक इति वाच्यम्"  

Here you can find some more details on the intransitive verbs in Paninian grammar:

So this is not against Paninian usages of  भावे and कर्मणि of the verbs.

  

Sri Nityananda has proved the seemingly non-Panian usages with the relevant portion from the thesis of his guru with अध्याहारand other techniques.

  

 Please come up better and clear examples for your contention and facility of other grammarians over Paninian grammar. I can't understand what do you mean कर्म in भावे प्रयोग.
