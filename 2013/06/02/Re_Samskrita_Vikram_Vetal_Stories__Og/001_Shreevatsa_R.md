The Vetala stories also occur in Somadeva's Katha-sarit-sagara.

This version is available on the GRETIL website, in IAST (you can use any of the transliteration tools to read it in Devanagari if you prefer):<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/4_narr/soksvppu.htm>

You can also follow the translation as you read along; the translation of the entire kathA-sarit-sAgara is available at<http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40588/40588-h/40588-h.htm#xd20e19929>

(Though you won't need the translation much, because the Sanskrit here is in extremely readable verse!)
