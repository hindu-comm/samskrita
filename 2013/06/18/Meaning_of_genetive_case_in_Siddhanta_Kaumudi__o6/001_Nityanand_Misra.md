It means that whenever a replacement is ordered by the genetive, it replaces only the final syllable (al) of that which is in the genitive.

  

The replacement of त्यद् by अ is ordered by 7-2-102 त्यदादीनामः (त्यदादीनाम् + अः) where त्यदादीनाम् is in genitive plural. Since त्यदादीनाम् is in genitive, अ will replace only द् and not the complete त्यद्.

  

That is the short answer. For a complete understanding as to when 1-1-52 applies and when it does not apply, you need to understand all of the following rules together -

  

1-1-52 अलोऽन्त्यस्य ।

1-1-53 ङिच्च ।

1-1-54 आदेः परस्य ।

1-1-55 अनेकाल्शित्सर्वस्य ।

Hope it is clear now.
