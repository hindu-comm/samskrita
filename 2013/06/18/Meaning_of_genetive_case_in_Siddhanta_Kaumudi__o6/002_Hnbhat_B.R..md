I think the question itself is not clear. The significance of षष्ठी genitive case in the sUtra itself is explained in the sUtra-s. Mr. Nityananda has explained the rule in questionअलोन्त्यस्य where there are two genitives. The question itself is confused. The series of sUtra-s are called परिभाषा-s i.e. the norms to be followed in interpreting the words used generally in Sanskrit, but used in a technical sense for interpretation of the सूत्र-s in theअष्टाध्यायी itself.

  

Now, to the series of the sUtra-s cited by Nityananda, one more sUtra has to be linked to complete the meaning as given by S C Basu and not only the genitives in this sUtra. - षष्ठी स्थानेयोगा॥ १।१।४८ which states the general replacementआदेशः ,

  

षष्ठी =  

षष्ठीनिर्दिष्टस्य य उच्यते आदेशः, सो ऽन्त्यस्य अलः स्थाने वेदितव्यः। which is translated by Basu as "of that स्थानिन् which is denoted by a term exhibited in the genitive or sixth case). This and the subsequent specifications of the items prescribed usingषष्ठी used in the prescriptions in the सूत्र-s in the whole Ashtadhyayi. Now, coming to the prescription of अ in the group गण त्यदादि, in the example in the sUtra prescribing it which is quoted and not in the example given in English, you can find genitive.

  

  

In short, the substitution ādeśa prescribed to the sthānin using genitive case in the vidhisūtra-s is specified in these paribhāśa-s. So the example is also the sūtra in which vidhi- is prescribed using the genitive case with the sthānin. In this case it is त्यदादिनामः in which "a" is prescribed to the tyadādi sub group of sarvādi group of pronouns and not only tyad. īt is tyadādi which is using genitive and the substitution "a" is substituted for the last lettr "al" in the declension of the pronouns in the group as made clear by Sri Nityananda. The same has been explained by Basu using the declension of tyad applying the rule relevant. tyad - tya+a - will become tya losing one "a" and another replacement t by s, and result in syaH स्यः in the nominative singular.

  

Sorry for the lengthy message.
