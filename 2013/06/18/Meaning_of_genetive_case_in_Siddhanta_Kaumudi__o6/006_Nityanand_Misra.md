A lot can be written and spoken about the Sutras. Please ask specific doubts and questions. The explanations to the Sutras with examples can be found in any grammar book or the numerous book and references available online (Dr. Bhat has given a link). If you are not satisfied with the explanations there or if you have any doubts/questions, I can help, but it is expected that the question be precise.
