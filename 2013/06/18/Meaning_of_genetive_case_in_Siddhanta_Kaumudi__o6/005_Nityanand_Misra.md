Very true, it was not clear what the question was about - the meaning of genitive case throughout Ashtadhyayi (coming from 1-1-48), or the meaning of genitive case in 1-1-52, or where the स्थानी*tyad* is in genitive, or if the replacement is only to be done in the genitive, or something else altogether. I assumed he wished to know about 1-1-52 and the rule where *tyad*is in genitive. But he may want to frame his precise question better.
