In Siddhanta Kaumudi(edited by SC Vasu), ४२ . अलोन्त्यस्य has a translation of "The substitute takes the place of only the final letter(of that which is denoted by a term exhibited in the genitive or sixth case)."

  

and in the explanation the example given is "when त्यद् is to be replaced with अ , it doesn't mean that the entire word is to be replaced, but just the last letter द् is to be replaced".

  

Then what is the significance of genitive case in the sutra?. Here, in the example, त्यद् is not in the genetive case?

  

I hope scholars can clarify this.
