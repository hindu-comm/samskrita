Always take Wikipedia with a pinch (well a ship load of, imho, when it comes to Indian issues) of salt.  
  

I will just quote copule of example. arghya, archya  
  

When enter veda lakshaNa, one will encounter words which have as many as 7 consonants.  
  

I will give you that word and the logic behind it after I get hold of the book tribhashhyaratna which I had lent to somebody and that person is dead way back in Feb 2008.
