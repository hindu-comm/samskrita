Dear Iyer,

  

Please read the Viky wordings =as " It is also the only name in Sanskrit with all the 3 letters joint (referred as जोडाक्षर) written English according to English usage as an English sentence according to English language and don't bring in Sanskrit grammar or Sanskrit works like "त्रिभाष्यरत्न" etc. into it.

  

In English, the sentence simply means this: "all the three letter (अक्षर} s in the wordप्रद्युम्नarejoint letters (=conjuncts)". This implies that there are three letters in the word and all the "three letters" (अक्षर)s are conjunct letters (referred as जोडाक्षर) . And in other words, all the (अक्षर)s in the "name" are conjuncts (referred as जोडाक्षर). And in none of the examples you have suggested, is a "name" and in any of them, "all the letters" are not conjuncts (referred as जोडाक्षर). And it is not the question of the conjuncts having "three letters", but the "name" which having "all the letters"are conjunct letters. Casually, in the name, the letters in total in the word
प्र-द्यु-म्न are 3 and all the 3 are conjunct letters. Why to infiltrate a "pinch of salt" into it with your logic?
