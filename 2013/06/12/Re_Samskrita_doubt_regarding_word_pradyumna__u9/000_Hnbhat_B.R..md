Just count the conjunct letters instead of total letters. You have wrongly read and understood the Viki and interpret it of your own. There are three conjunct letters what you call "jodakshar" or "संयुक्तवर्ण " in Sanskrit, in the name प्र -1, दयु 2, म्न 3.

  

This is not seen in any of the words you have quoted अगस्त्य. But you can create sequences with all conjunct letters, स्त्र्यत्र त्रात्री and the like. But they have stated it as the name having all the 3 letters conjunct as I have shown all the three in consequence numbered. Does it change the meaning of the word प्रद्युम्न in any way? I don't think.
