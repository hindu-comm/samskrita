IIRC, The difference and the explanation for भ्रातृव्यः is in svara  
siddhaanta by aacarya soma deva shaastrii published by aarya samaaj  
  
Of course, there are many many works on svara siddhanta as outlined in  
Parameshvara Aithal's veda lakshana: a descriptive bibliography.  
  
I asked this question here as I neither have sufficient knowledge of  
sanskR^ita or channdas not have access to the references mentioned in  
Aithal's book.  
  
<http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GArqedrNsoUC&pg=PA696&lpg=PA696&dq=svara+siddhanta&source=bl&ots=cRrpUQY2-g&sig=kIPtjrKq-ChBGXl1qAzAMO9gLkM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dc_NUdanNYL5rQeFsoGAAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=svara%20siddhanta&f=false>  
  
I hoped the esteemed scholars would throw light on this matter rather  
than throwing me around to find rare books which are spread across the  
world (some are in mysore, some are in hamburg, some are in  
travancore, BORI, Baroda etc. etc.) as of today.  
  
I must say I don't have the resources to travel there nor have the  
necessary credentials to access them as I am not a "qualified"  
Sanskrit scholar. I am just a common man who knows to chant few vedic  
mantras and fragments of ghana paatha (only in tai. shaakha) which I  
learnt from my gurus.  
  
I do not have any commentaries, Many of my books are lost due to  
shifting residence from one place to another or giving it to people,  
many of them are no more and hence I can't go and ask for them now.  
  
I hoped somebody who had access to saayaNa bhaashya or One more  
bhaashya (I dont remember the name of the author -- bhatta bhaaskara?)  
of Tai. Sa.mhitaa would help me.  
  
Hoping for further light on this matter  
  
Humble thanks and Regards,
