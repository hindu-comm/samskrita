Sorry for the posting before completing the message. It is only in Vedic usage that "svara" counts in meaning. Panini has different suffixes as given, which could be distinguished by the "svara" only in the Vedic usage of the word. It is not anyhow meant to denote the brother any way, the children of brothers popularly known as दायाद-s whose enmity is popular from the case of Pandava-s and Kaurava-s and as extended to enemies in general, like the word "सपत्न" itself.

  

भ्रातृशब्दादपत्ये व्यत् प्रत्ययो भवति। चकाराच् छश्च। अणो ऽपवादः। **भ्रातृव्यः, भ्रात्रीयः**। तकारः स्वरार्थः। in the first sUtra.  

The suffix means children of brother/s. भ्रात्रीयः is the other word which means the children of brother/s (either elder or younger brother, no difference for translation or referring to them as such). Only the first word is the one which means both enemy and the children of brothers.

  

  

सपत्नशब्दः शत्रुपर्यायः शब्दान्तरव्युत्पन्नम् एव। सप्त्नीशब्दादपरे ऽकारम् इव अर्थे निपातयन्ति। सप्त्नीव सपत्नः।  

  

प्रत्ययेनाऽपत्यमुच्यते।  

भ्रातृशब्दार्थस्तु न विवक्षितः। तथाच भ्रातृशब्दोत्तरत्वे व्यन्प्रत्ययार्थः शत्रुरिति भाष्ये स्पष्टम्। ननु \`पाप्मना भ्रातृव्येणे'ति कथं, पाप्मनोऽपत्यत्वाऽभावादित्यत आह– उपचारादिति। हिंसकत्वगुणयोगाल्लाक्षणिक इत्यर्थः।

  

The above is the grammarians' view. It is decided by the usage and the context in classical language. For Vedic usages, you can refer to the commentaries in the context.
