I don't know what do you want. To know the meaning of the verses, you can refer to either of the Bhashya-s available of Bhattabhaskara or Sayana which explain svara-s wherever needed. (Note that everywhere svara doesn't change the meaning, and only in bhratrivya, I have already explained why it differs) both are available online for download or reading online. If you want to learn svara-siddhanata itself of Veda-s, you have to go through the similar books and it would be too much to expect someone to translate it according to svara-siddhanta. If you want to know the meaning of them, any translation either following Bhattabhaskara or Sayana.

  

This being the position, you can decide first what do you want and place your request specifically.
