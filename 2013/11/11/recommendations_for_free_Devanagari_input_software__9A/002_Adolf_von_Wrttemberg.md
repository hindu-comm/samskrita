प्रिय Kotamraju,

I am running Windows 8.1 Pro and using Office 365 with Devanaagarii installed on four computers. Here is my recommendation:

By far the most useful IME (Input Method Editor) and aesthetically pleasing Siddhanta fonts are those obtainable for free from:

<http://svayambhava.blogspot.com/p/siddhanta-devanagariunicode-open-type.html>



If you change your default font for both English and देवनागरी in MS Word
to Siddhanta, then the font sizes correspond exactly between the two alphabets. Also you can “stack” consonants in clusters instead of using the halanta. For example, the word गङ्गा stacks the nasal “n” over the “g” sound using the Siddhanta font. To rapidly change from Sanskrit to English, simply hold down the WINDOWS key and press the SPACEBAR. It is a toggle function. I also use Classical Greek so I toggle among the three alphabets. It is compliant with the latest Unicode versions. You can also use the free Microsoft Keyboard Creation Editor noted in the link above to make any additions/modifications.

If you install it and have any post-installation questions, then please contact me at: [wolf...@bellsouth.net]() and I shall be glad to help.
