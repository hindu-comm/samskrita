Can anybody recommend a good freely downloadable software for inputting Devanagari which supports Unicode? Preferably one which is easy to operate on the newest Windows platforms.

Baraha is good but no longer free. iTranslator 2003 too used to be ok but I am not sure if it still works as well as it used to. 

  

Thank you
