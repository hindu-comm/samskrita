Actually if you are using windows 7 then you don't need any software -

Go to Start - control panel

Select Region and Language

Go to Keyboards and Languages tab

Click on Change Keyboards

Click on Add

From the drop down select Devanagari input



once you finish this you will see an icon EN on the bottom right corner of taskbar.

This is how you can on screen virtual keyboard to see what you are tying until you get used to it
