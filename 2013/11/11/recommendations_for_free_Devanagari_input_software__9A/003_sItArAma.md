Sorry I forgot to write

When you see "EN" on the bottom right hand corner, click on it and you will see HI Hindi India.

Whenever you want to type in Devanagari select HI and you will be good to go.

The onscreen keyboard is not good to type but it will help you familiarize with the keyboard layout.

this links also talks about it <http://www.ubcsanskrit.ca/keyboards.html>



it even gives an exe file for different input layout
