Also a good idea would be to change the subject line if you are receiving abridged mail for i read the subject line as " Re: \[Samskrita\] Abridged summary of [sams...@googlegroups.com]() - 3 Messages in 1 Topic"  

Now to answer the question of Ramakrishna a few volumes are available at DLI I don't think all parts are available Part 3 and Part 4 are. If anyone has Part 1 and 2 please share I would be much obliged
