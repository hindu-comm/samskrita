In the book Bhuvanesha-Laukika-Nyaya-Sahasri by Pandit Thakur Datta Sharma, #748 (file att.) shRRi\~NgagrAhikAnyAya is listed.

  

An English translation gives other details - file att. ( I do not have details about this translation).  
  
I am not sure if this 'nyAya' is taken from any text of tarka-shastra.
