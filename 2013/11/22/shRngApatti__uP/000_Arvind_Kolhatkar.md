Dear Group,

  

शृङ्गापत्ति, a word of Sanskrit derivation, is used in Marathi, and perhaps in other Indian languages too, to mean 'a dilemma', a state of mind where it is difficult to choose between two equally good choices.
I have been trying to locate how this word got created in Sanskrit but have not found any answer.  

  

It may have its origin in discussions about logic. It could also have its origin in a Panchatantra, Hitopadesha or a similar collection of fables. I wonder if a member of this learned Group help me answer this question.
