I, too, am now suspecting what Satyajit Borwankar says above.

  

The wordशृङ्गापत्ति is not listed in Molesworth's Marathi-English Dictionary published in 1831 or in its revision published in 1857. On the other hand, it is listed in VG Apte'sमहाराष्ट्र शब्दरत्नाकर first published in 1920.

  

This would indicate that the word entered the language sometime between 1857 and 1920 and would be the creation of Krishnashastri Chiplunkar or Vishnushastri Chiplunkar - his son - or of someone like them, such as Lokmanya Tilak, NC Kelkar, or even of my g-g-grandfather Mahadevashastri Kolhatkar, all of whom were known for their writings in Marathi.

  

As to use in Logic, Molesworth does list 'शृङ्गग्राहिका' as a term in Logic, meaning 'taking singly or severally all the particulars included under a general term.' What does this mean? Can this be illustrated with an example?
