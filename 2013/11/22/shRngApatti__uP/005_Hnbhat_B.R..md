Though without complete context, it is difficult to understand the sequence, the test you have given seems to be like this:

  

तथा हि\| विषाक्ता लौहमयी शलाका, कच्छपिका, शृङ्गाटिका-प्रच्छन्नं

  

शूलगर्भं गर्तं, विषाक्तं सर्पिः पयो वेत्यादिप्राणापहारव्याप्तम \|

  

अव्याप्तावपि प्रयोक्तुः परजिघांसां गमयति \| "

  

It seems to be joined with the next word as shown above making it to mean, the hole with शूल inside hidden in the four square. each of them enough to kill the man. The technical language is such, in the sentence, that it is difficult to translate word by word in the above sentence as it is related with the preceding part of the sentence, before तथा हि\|
