नमस्सर्वेभ्यः,  
  
In Mallinatha's commentary on the first sloka of रघुवंशम् , he glosses पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ as शर्वशिवयोः . Is Parvati being referred to as Sarva, a name that generally refers to Siva? Or has Mallinatha just flipped the order for reasons of समास, and is Parvati being referred to as शिवा ?  
  
Thanks in advance,  
Priya
