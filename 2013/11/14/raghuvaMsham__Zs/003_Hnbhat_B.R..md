I don't see any reason to follow the order of Kalidasa, in the gloss  
also. If you have any, please search for it.  
  
But consistensy should be in पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ = शिवौ = शिवा च शिवश्च -  
शिवौ एकशेषः, "पुमान् स्त्रिया" will convey the idea of dvandva, in  
nominative case. And not in the षष्ठी or सप्तमी which never glosses  
the original compound.  
  
Why are you sticking to your own idea of consistency other than Grammar>
