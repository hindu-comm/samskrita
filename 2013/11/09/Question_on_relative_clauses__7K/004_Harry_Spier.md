Thank you everyone,  

  

There is still one point I'm unclear about, The example I used was from part of an exercise in Madhav Desphande's Sanskrit Primer "saṁskṛtasubhodhinī".

In that book he writes(page 68):

**'yadi "if" and tarhi "then" (conditional):** These words are generally placed in the beginning of the clauses they qualify. **The "if" clause" normally comes first.**'

  

But then a few pages later (page 75) he appears to be saying the opposite:

He writes:

'The clauses with forms of **yad** such as case forms, or indeclinable forms such as **yadi**, yadā, and yatra, are relative clauses. **The relative clauses can come either before or after the main clause**, i.e. the clause with forms of the co-relative pronoun such as tad (including its case forms and indeclinable forms such as **tarhi**, tadā, and tatra). '

  

So I'm unclear from those two statements of Dr. Deshpande's above whether it is unusual or bad Sanskrit to have the tad,tadā or tarhi clause before the yad, yadā or yadi clause.
