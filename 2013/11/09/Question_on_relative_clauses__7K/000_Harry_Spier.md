Dear list members,  

  

To translate this sentence into Sanskrit:

"Oh king, you should give me gold, if you are pleased by my poem"

  

which is more correct:

A)

like this

nṛpate yadi mama kāvyena tuṣyes tarhi kanakam mahyaṁ yaccheḥ \|  
  

or

  

B\) more like the English by:

1\) placing the "tarhi" clause first.(can a clause beginning in "tarhi" be placed before the clause beginning in "yadi" ?)

2\) using the indicative instead of the optative for the verb " tuṣ "

like this:  
nṛpate tarhi kanakam mahyaṁ yaccher yadi mama kāvyena tuṣyasi  

  

Thanks,

Harry
