Hello Spier,  
  

What Prof. Deshpande reports is:  

Normally (i.e. if we look at the statistics, then most of the times), if clause comes first.  

But occasionally we find the if clause later also.  
  

In other words, both the word orders are grammatical. One is more preferable over the other.  
  

Further, as has been pointed out by other scholars here, one of the word among the yadi-tarhi pair can be dropped.  
So we can have yadi-tarhi,tarhi-yadi,only yadi, only tarhi in such sentences.  
  

Best,  
Amba Kulkarni
