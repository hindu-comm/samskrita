Dear list members,  

  

In our organisation we share files of devanagari sanskrit between some people who use Windows PC's and some people who use Mac's. We have been using PDF to share these files because the font the Mac users were using was not unicode and also could only be used on a Mac. But this is far from Ideal because the PDF documents cant be editted. Ideally we would like to be able to produce documents using a unicode font in OpenOffice or LibreOffice so that they could be editted directly by both the PC and the Mac users. 

  

I say OpenOffice or LibreOffice partly because of problems with using Microsoft Word for Mac

See this discussion on the Indology list about problems with Word for the Mac

See the following link -look under thread "devanagari keyboard

<http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2013-November/thread.html>

  

I use a Windows PC and the font Sanskrit 2003 from Omkarananda Ashram <http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/itranslator2003.htm> to produce devanagari or devanagari + english documents. The description of the font says it has all attested ligatures. There is also a link from this website to another unicode font Chandas (for Windows) which also says it has all attested ligatures. See: <http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/index.html>

  

But both these fonts are for Windows. I think the issue is that when you design a font, you can include features only recognisable by windows called "volt features", you can also include features called "AAT features" only recognisable by Mac computers. So I believe that Sanskrit 2003 and Chandas cannot be used on a Mac.

  

1\) Can someone confirm whether it is true that the fonts from the Omkarananda ashram Sanskrit 2003 and Chandas don't work on Mac's

  

2\) Most importantly can someone recommend a Unicode font for the Mac that has a fairly complete set of ligatures (built in conjunct consonents) . Its important that its set of ligatures is fairly comprehensive so that when I send a Mac user a document I've created using Itranslator 2003 and the font Sanskrit 2003 and they open it in OpenOffice their font can produce the conjunt consonents doesn't put in a bunch of virama's instead.

  

Many thanks,

Harry Spier
