Dear All,

  

Greetings and Namaste. Kartika Deepam/Bharani Deepam falls on Sunday (17-Nov-2013) (and Monday for some). As Kartika Deepam is closely associated with both Lord Vishnu as well as Lord Shiva (and also to Lord Subrahmanya), I am attaching a couple of short and sweet stutis :

  

1\. Sri Bhagavat Stuti - By Agni - Skanda Puranam - this is a short stuti by Agni on Lord Vishnu.

  

2\. Sri Shiva Pancha Ratnam - Lord Krishna - Chyutapuri Mahatmya - Shiva Puranam - this a short stuti by Lord Krishna on Lord Krittivasa (Lord Shiva).

  

Both hymns are said to destroy the sins of the chanter and bestow all rightful wishes.

  

I had originally hoped to share a couple of other longer hymns but again time is the scapegoat.

  

May We Pray To The Luminous Lord, who manifests Himself in many Forms for the benefit of our own vasanas, to lead us from darkness to Light in our spiritual journey - tamaso mA jyotir gamaya.
