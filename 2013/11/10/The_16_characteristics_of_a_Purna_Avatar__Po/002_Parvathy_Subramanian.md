Bhat mahodaya!!



Pranams!



It was a typo when I typed from my android that too in a hurry.



My question was about Karana Brahman and Karya Brahman-Scriptural reference; this is what I intended knowing for the purpose;



Krishna Avatar is Purna Avatar- but in the description about his 16 Kalas, I find:there are different type of explanation; hence I wanted the help of thescholars of this group.



Bhat Mahodaya!! can you also give the meaning of the verse (Purusharth-'shodasakkala purusho.....)given in English



With regards,

Parvathy
