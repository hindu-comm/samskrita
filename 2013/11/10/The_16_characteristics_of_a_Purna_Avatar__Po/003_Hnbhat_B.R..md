If you give the clear reference of Bhagavata Purana, if you have referred to it as scriptural description you had found, the commentaries give different explanations on the verse or the reference. Otherwise you can give yourself the references where you found those his descriptions so that others also could know them.

You asked for scriptural references and I have given. You can read any translations of them and get their meaning. I am not going to try myself to translate. Or you can refer to any Bhashya or commentaries on them ether in Hindi or the language you know.
