Raama,



 You must realize, that ordinary people do not have your extraordinary powers.

  

I for one, am only able to 'click on a deck' to obtain its size -after- I have downloaded it, not before!



And do understand, that normalpeopleare unable to readminds. It is a weakness we have.

Given thatthe vast majority of computer users on the planet are Windows users,

that is the natural assumption we make. We have to bespecifically informedif otherwise.

  

Again,please be aware thatwhenpeople speak of'download size limits', and no such a limit is obvious, thetend to look around for the not obvious. -perhaps tothe limits imposed by their ISP's, where the ability to download unrestricted GB's of comes at a price!

  

  

Whatever.

  

Perhaps you can enlighten me here:

  

 I have long wondered what happens afterall those the'rules' of grammar have been memorised.

  

Assuming that the fruits of such labours lies in the application of suchrules, how are they actually applied?

  

To use a simple English 'rule' as an example:

Having learnt the rule 'i before e, except after c', a long time ago. Faced with thatparticularspelling situation, I originally hadthe need to remind myself of that rule byrecitingit. Eventually, itbecame possible for me to be able to write such as 'receive' without even thinking about rules!

And likewise,exceptions to such rule, e.g. science - I have no idea how many of exceptions there are, what rules they have, indeed if there are any.

  

So, my question is, does the same situation apply to users of that most perfected of grammars, albeit with the added complexity of havingto get at the relevant rules in the first place.

  

Artha:

 Do beginners have to reciteall the way from thebeginning? How do they get to the stage where they arethey able to jump straight to the relevant rule(s)?

  

I have yet to get the hang of this life, let alone the next one.
