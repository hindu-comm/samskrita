Taff,

Thank youfor your e-mail. all the things you mentioned about anki are already there. when you click on a deck it shows the size of the deck, that's why I did not feel the need to mention it again. I am not aware of any monthly upload / download size limit.

Its free for desktop and android version, however for iOS one has to pay $25.



It would be nice to create a deck for Devanagari alphabets. May be someday I will.



"Mindless repetition can damage yourhealth!"

I have to humbly disagree with you on above statement

Personally I know may people who memorized entire "Ashtadhyayi" bhagwadgeeta, Rudram, Mahanyasam and many texts from Vedas, I do not see any health problems in them. May be rote memorization is in theIndian genes.



as a kid I memorize Vishnu & lalitasahastranamam, many otherstotras, those were all mindless repetition, nothing happened to my health.
