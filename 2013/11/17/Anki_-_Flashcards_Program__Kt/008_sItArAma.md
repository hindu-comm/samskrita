Dear Taff,

you have mentioned many things in your mail. Let me see if I can address all the issues.



1\. I am attaching anki webpage screenshot to show you where the file size appears. It even gives a warning in red text.

2\. Ordinary people think they are ordinary and that's why they are ordinary. Extraordinary are not special people, they just don't think they are ordinary folks and work lot hardercompared to rest of the pack to prove it.

3\. Regarding usage of grammar rules, that's a detailed study in itself. People spend years mastering it, I am still working on my rules memorization and therefore have a long way to go. I have to memorize 5 more chapters. But during my journey I created some notes and I am attaching a copy with this mail. This note is derivation of Rama Shabda.

4\. About applying rules all I can say is only practicecan help, may be other scholars can comment on that one. as my teacher say "पुरुषार्थ तो करना ही पढता है". Meaning one has to go through the labor of learning there is no other way. There is another hindi proverb "अपने मरे बगैर स्वर्ग नही मिलता" one does not attain heaven without dying. personwho has to desire to go to heaven has to die.Here dying is analogous to hard working.



Regards

Raama
