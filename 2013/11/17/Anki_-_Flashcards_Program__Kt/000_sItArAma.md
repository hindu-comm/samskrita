नमस्ते  

Let me write the disclaimer first that I am not advertising for this product. I bought it, used it, I like it and want to share with others who might have similar goals. Now lets get to the mail :)  
  

I always wanted to memorize Bhagwadgeeta - some can argue whats the need to memorize, an elderly person said once to me, everything is in the book, whats in your head is only matters and someday will be useful to you.  
  

I created Anki deck for Shrimad Bhawadgeeta, [Here is the link for it](https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=D62A5AF2B18B55D6&id=D62A5AF2B18B55D6%21105#cid=D62A5AF2B18B55D6&id=D62A5AF2B18B55D6%211033)  
  
I set myself 2 - 3 shlokas a day at this pace I should be able to memorize entire text within a year. You can download Anki Software from here <http://ankisrs.net/>  
I can tell you more about this software but all the info is given on the above given website.  
  

Set yourself at a realistic pace and make it a habit to use this program regularly. When we don't have any tool we tend to procrastinate, with this tool, if you skip 5 days then when you open the software it will show, 10 - 15 new cards to memorize and depending upon where you are number of cards to review. Beginners can see some you tube videos to learn more about using the program.  

  

To use the deck I shared -  

Install Anki on your device  

download the file I shared in the above link  

Double click it  

Its defaults to 20 cards a day change it to your liking.  

Happy learning  

  

I hope someone finds this information useful. I am creating similar deck for Ashtadhyayi and if audio is available i can create similar one for Amarakosha as well.
