Raama,

  

Yes, but you should mention that thedeck is a rather large download (90+ MB) which can eat into a users monthly download allowance

\- this probably due to the fact that it contains audiofiles.

  

You should also mentionthat the deckis entirely in theDevanagari script.

  

Anki software is completely free, BTW.

  

It is especially designedfor learning long list of items such as alphabets (not to mention theirligatures!),conjugations and inflections,

as it overcomesthe common problem ofoverlearning the first items in such lists,

to the detriment of the later ones.

Due to the ever lengthening list of items to repeat to get to the unlearned ones!

  

  

In a word, it reduces the tedium ofsuchlearning chores, to the extent that it is increases the possibility of actually getting to the job done!

  

  

Raama,how about a deck of flashcards for Devanagari-now, that would be useful. Would you believe that there isn't one!

I havecreated one for my own use, but without authenticaudio. . . and withoutschoolingin the art ofpresenting teaching material!  

  

  

Hands up, all those that want to learn all the verses of theAshtadhyayi by heart! (:-)

  

It has long since been proved that such epic tasks on a developing mind (youngchildren) has theserious side effect leaving other naturally acquired mental skills e.g. social skills, empathy etc.,permanentlyundeveloped.

  

Mindless repetition can damage yourhealth!
