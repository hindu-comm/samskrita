आत्मीय सीतारामजी,

  

you have done a wonderful favour by bringing Anki to our notice. I have downloaded the software as well as Bhagavad Geeta and have started using it effectively.

  

coming to mindless repetition: 

we have done it quite effectively during our school days and it has helped rather than doing any harm. We memorized tables, dhatu paath, shubhashitas, hyms and what not !! In fact memorising tables have helped us do maths quickly and in a better way.

  

Anki, will be very much useful as it is scientifically structured.

  

धन्यवादा:
