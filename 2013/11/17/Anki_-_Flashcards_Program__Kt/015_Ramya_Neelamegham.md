Hari Om

  

Respected Sri Ramji

  

Can you please guide me on how to get sanskrit fonts to appear in Anki. i tried to create a deck to revise sanskrit words for my exam but nothing is showing up.

  

I tried to move to follow the directions given in "custom font' installation but it still did not work. I would be very indebted to you if you can let me know what are the steps required to create a deck with sanskrit fonts for memorizing rules. Thank you very much.
