You are following up a7 mth old thread.However, perhaps I can be of some help as I have used (played with) Anki.

  

  

As explaineddown in the Help manual,font styling etc. is effected through HTML and CSS formatstyle sheets.

  

  

There is a video on youtube showing how its done

But to start with, I found it better to importa ready made package, and experiment with that.

Dig around on <https://ankiweb.net/.> Be warned though, Anki is difficult to master. It is easy to use - once you've learned how.
