Firstly thank you to everyone who answered my recent questions.  

  

In the 10th verse of the annapūrṇastotram

  

kṣatratrāṇakarī mahābhayakarī mātā kṛpāsāgarī  
sākṣānmokṣakarī sadā śivakarī vighneśvarī śrīdharī \|  
dakṣākrandakarī nirāmayakarī kāśīpurādhīśvarī  
bhikṣāṁ dehi kṛpāvalambanakarī mātānnapūrṇeśvarī \|\|  

  

I'm not clear how to understand the compound " kṣatratrāṇakarī" whether that means "protectress of Kshatriyas" or "protectress of the Supreme power" or "protectress of government" etc.

  

Thanks,

Harry
