Namaste, P. K. Ramakrishnan:

  

I am interested in knowing more details about the Devanagari typing software, called "Sanscrit," mentioned in your e-mail (included in this reply). In particular, I am curious to know how well the Sanscrit program handles what are termed conjunct consonants in Sanskrit and what the degree of complexity in Devanagari type that Sanscrit is capable of, within its representational schemata. Moreover, you mention that Sanscrit can be used with other Indian languages. Are these Indian languages only those that use the Devanagari script or can Sanscrit be used to type non-Devanagari script languages, such as Tamil and Kannada, for example?

  

We utilize Devanagari and other Indian scripts for our correspondence and publications, so any software that makes the Devanagari script easier to use (as well as other Indian scripts, such as Tamil and Kannada) would be of great assistance in our research work here at the Foundation, since we are a non-profit organization, primarily engaged in the digital scansion, preservation and publication of manuscripts that otherwise might be lost to the elements or to neglect. Therefore, I would appreciate any additional information that you could supply me with on Sanscrit. Thank you in advance.

  

Best,
