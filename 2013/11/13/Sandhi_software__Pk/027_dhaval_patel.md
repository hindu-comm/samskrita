Now, you may see a link "Go Back" on that page, which will take you to the HTML page.

Now, that has been fixed. e.g.<http://www.lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/sandhi.php?first=iti&second=ucyate&tran=Devanagari&pada=pada>. So now you can share the specific cases also.

This depends on the input conventions. In sanskrit sandhis, there are cases where there are two consecutive anusvAras. So, this input convention may be dangerously wrong in that case.

The input doesn't look like sanskrit words.

That is based on the user preferences. The machine can duplicate. If there is popular demand, maybe there can be a user input which will ask the user whether they want to see the dvitva cases or not. Let me try for that.
