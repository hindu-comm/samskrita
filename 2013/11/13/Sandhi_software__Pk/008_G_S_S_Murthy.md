Dear scholars,

In my view it is unnecessary to start at Panini sutra level to develop a sandhi joiner, unless the program is meant to be a tribute to the genius of Panini.

In fact it would be interesting to develop a learning program which formulates and modifies rules as we keep inputting more and more instances of sandhi joining.

Regards

Murthy
