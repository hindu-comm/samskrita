Dear all,

Please find attached link to a software for doing sandhi which I am currently trying to create.

  

<http://www.lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/sandhi.html>

  

This is the place where it will be available for testing.

  

I have tried to include prakriyA as per siddhAntakaumudI text.

  

Wherever there is deviation, please feel free to drop a message either in this thread or offline.

Please oblige me by spending some of your precious time and giving your valuable inputs.  

  

N.B. The source code (PHP) used for this machine is available at[https://github.com/drdhaval2785/sanskrit  
](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/sanskrit)
