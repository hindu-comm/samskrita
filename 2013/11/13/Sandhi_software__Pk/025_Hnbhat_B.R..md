You were wrong. When it is शकन्ध्वदिषु पररूप, it should have been with  
the sandhi and split forms both. Otherwise, you will not get any  
sandhi but only those in the शकन्ध्वादि list already in the programme,  
and the correct splitting of the सन्धि form as given in the  
authoritative books and not as you like to have it split.  
  
For पतञ्जलि, the normally split compound is पतन्तः अञ्जलयो यस्मिन् इति  
बहुव्रीहि compound and the compound members are पतत्+अञ्जलि - in the  
compound formation, and not as you have given, which involve bahuvrihi  
compound formation also. पत+अन्जलिः not the सन्धि required for the  
compound formation, and hence your input was wrong and you got wrong  
form what is expected. If he had listed, पतञ्जलि under the शकन्ध्वादि,  
as applicable to पतञ्जलि, the required input form पतत्+अञ्जलि -, then  
only it would give the correct form. Or it would give, without पतञ्जलि  
in the सन्धि output form only पतदञ्जलि - or any declined form also  
form of the word should be given in शकन्ध्वादि list.  
  
The output is correct for your input.
