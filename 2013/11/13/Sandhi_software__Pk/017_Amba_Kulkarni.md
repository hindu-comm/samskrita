I looked at various kinds of issues you have noted down.  
  

A similar study of suutras related to compound formation has been undertaken by my student.  

  

He will be presenting his work at the ICON -- the conference on NLP at Noida in Dec 2013. After the conference, the paper will be available on my webpage.  
  

There we classify the suutras into different categories and also discuss various kind of information needed by machine to generate the compounds automatically from the given paraphrase.
