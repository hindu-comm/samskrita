+1. I wish other grammar tools like[tdil-dc.in/san/sandhi/sandhi_dit.html](http://tdil-dc.in/san/sandhi/sandhi_dit.html) were open-sourced and published(eg: on [github.com](http://github.com) )

  

This is precisely the reason why everybody ends up reinventing the wheel. I see at least three sandhi machines already developed by JNU / HCU / TDIL. There may be many others. But as long as the information is in closed domain, there is no scope to modify it for one's individual need.
