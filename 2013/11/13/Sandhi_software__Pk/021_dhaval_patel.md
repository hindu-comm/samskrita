Question 1: Is there a consolidated state of the art review ( for the period 1970 to 2013) on Samskrutham Language modeling for Computer related work – As an Indian Tradition ( beyond the Harvard school thoughts reflected in Sanskrit Computational linguistics analysis ? To the best of my knowledge, the work in this area has been isolated and fragmented efforts, addressing only peripherals of Paninian rules. This is not sufficient to address any real issue related to Devanagari script or Samskrutham or the Indian languages needs.  

  

I don't think there are many reviews of such sort. Before reviews, we should at least pull together the sources first. Once the sources are listed, the review can be undertaken by experts. A welcome step in this regard is taken by Vishvas by uploading many open source codes on his Github page. And the latest addition was by Prof. Amba Kulakarni. Once we have the resources, the review can go on.

Once the review is over and there are specifically laid down requirements on what needs to be done, there are many sanskrit oriented programmers who can do this job on voluntary basis. I disagree with the presumption that productivity and research are not always best suited for open source deliberation.

And by the way, sanskrit related softwares have always been developed not for commercial gain, but by personal interests. So, as far as sanskrit computational development is concerned, it can always be open source.



Hope the august members of the groups will do their level best to bring the hitherto efforts to open source domain.

  

Thanking you all.
