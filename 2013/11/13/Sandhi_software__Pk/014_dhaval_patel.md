Thank you very much ma'am.

It will take me some time to go through your code, because I don't understand the programming language used. But a plain reading of the code shows that it will not be difficult to understand that language.

Thank you indeed.

  

And to keep the discussion focused -

The main idea is to find out the bugs in the system and repair it.

So, any help in form of testing and reporting the errors will be highly appreciated.

  

I am attaching the known issues of the code as of now.

Any help to sort them out will also be highly welcome.
