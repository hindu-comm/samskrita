Regarding Amba Kulkarniji's Sandhi program, I have glanced through the initial comments portion where it is said,

"

ApavAda rules which require special conditions on the categories, or semantic fields etc. (for example, conditions such as if the word is in dvi-vacana, or if the word is a pratyaya, etc.) are not yet handled.

"

The semantic aspect of the first word being dvivacana has been taken care of in my Java program where the program queries in the appropriate context if it is a dvivacana and the user has to input an answer.Depending on the answer, the program outputs appropriately.

  

Regards

Murthy
