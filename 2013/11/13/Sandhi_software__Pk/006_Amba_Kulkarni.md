Dear Dhaval Patel ji and Vishvas ji,  
  

The sandhi joiner developed by University of Hyderabad in collaboration with RS Vidyapeetha Tirupati is available under GPL.  

  

The same sandhi joiner is given to TDIL as a part of the consortium project, and is on TDIL website.  
  

There is another sandhi joiner developed by Prof. Gérard Huet <http://sanskrit.inria.fr>  
  

What is required is collaboration. In 2006 when I noticed that Prof Huet is also working in this direction, we started collaborating with each other to avoid any duplication of efforts. This also resulted in a consortium for Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, which has organised 5 conferences till now, and has led to many more collaborative efforts both at the national as well as international level.  
  
Prof Huet has already developed a very sophisticated practical sandhi splitter (segmenter), and at the university of Hyderabad, we have developed a parser (sentential analyser). Further, these tools also interact with each other, i.e. I can use heritage segmenter to split the Sanskrit sentence into words, which then can be passed on my parser for kaaraka level analysis. This is possible only through the collaboration.  
  

On the one side there is a necessity to join the hands together, so that there are no duplication of efforts.  

On the other hand, the researchers may like to develop the same tool following different algorithms. For example, if we take English language, there are dozens of parsers for English being developed following different approaches. Many of them are available either under open source, or for reasearch purpose, or as an online tool.  
  

What I observe is many enthusiasts start the work on Sanskrit, but once they encounter the complexity the language poses, their enthusiasm dies.  
  

Now coming back to Sri Dhaval Patel ji's efforts. I see that what he is trying to do is something different from the way I have done it.  

He is trying to develop an algorithm, where he is ordering the sandhi rules manually.  

The way I have implemented is just a simple ready-made matrix. This I needed to invert the rules quickly.  
  

But as a researcher I'll be more interested in knowing how the order in the Ashtadhyayi itself can trigger the order of the rules.  

Is it necessary to use 'paribhaashaa's such as 'nitya-antaranga...' etc. So I myself will be implementing sandhi joiner in a different way.  

  

I would welcome more such efforts, which will revive the Paninian tradition,and at the same time I also welcome the collaboration, and sharing of resources to avoid duplication of efforts.  
  
With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
