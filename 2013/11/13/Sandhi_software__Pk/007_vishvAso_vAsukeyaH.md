नमस्ते अम्बार्ये।

  

That is great news. Where is it published?  
In general, the best practice is to provide a link on the tool's interface to the source-code behind it (as was done by shreevatsa here -<http://sanskritmetres.appspot.com/>).

  

If it is not published on the internet, I strongly recommend using the [github.com](http://github.com) repository popular among developers - It enables parallel development, and makes branching easy -- in addition the original authors can continue to use it for version control.
