Dhaval has mentioned some issues with this software. In 12th point, he has mentioned शकन्ध्वादिषु पररूपं वाच्यम् is आकृतिगण, so naturally, some more forms can be included. But, just to test I queried पत + अञ्जलिः, using प्रातिपदिक+प्रत्यय option, and the only result was पताञ्जलिः using अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः . In सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, पतञ्जलिः is given as the result. Is this a bug?  
  
Correct me if I am wrong.
