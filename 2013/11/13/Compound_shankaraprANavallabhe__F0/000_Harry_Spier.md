Dear list members,  

  

The 11th verse of the annapūrṇastotram is:

annapūrṇe sadāpūrṇe śaṅkaraprāṇavallabhe \|  
jñānavairāgyasiddhyarthaṁ bhikṣāṁ dehi ca pārvati \|\| 11 \|\|

  

A translation I've seen breaks up the compound śaṅkaraprāṇavallabhe as
śaṅkara-prāṇa-vallabhe and translates it as "dearer to Shankara than his life".

Is it grammatical to also break the compound up as
śaṅkara-prāṇavat-labhe ?

And could that mean something like "from whom Shankara obtains his strength"?

Dear

Many thanks,

Harry Spier
