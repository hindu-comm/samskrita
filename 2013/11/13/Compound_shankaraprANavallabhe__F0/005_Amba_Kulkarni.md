Compounding is a language phenomenon where two or more words join together producing a new word. In case of Sanskrit, during this process, there is loss of vibhakti, and hence the relation between the words now needs to determined through the context.  

In order to understand the compound, we need to supply the vibhakti. This is what the paraphrase does.  
  

So all the paraphrases that are given by Prof. Bhat show the relations between the two words.  

  

Sometimes the compounds are ambiguous leading to more than one paraphrases as shown by Prof Bhat above viz.  

शङ्कर एव प्राणवल्लभो यस्याः सा इति बहुव्रीहिः,  
शङ्करेण प्राणवल्लभा - शङ्करप्राणवल्लभा (तृतीयातत्पुरुषः),

  
शङ्करस्य प्राणावल्लभा - शङ्करस्य प्राणवल्लभा।  

शङ्करे प्राणवल्लभा - इति सप्तमीतत्पुरुषः।  
  

So this is not a strange decomposition.  
  

In all these examples, the type of the compound (or the relation between the words) was different.  

  

To add to it a little more complexity, a compound say a-b-c with 3 components can be grouped in 2 ways as \<\<a-b>-c> or \<a-\<b-c>\> leading to two different parses, and each of the compound further can be of different type which leads to several interpretations.  
  

Sanskrit literature is full of such compounds with more than 2 components, sometimes even as many as 10-12 components.  
  

English has a tendency to write the components separately, such as 'iron water pump', or 'color television set' etc.
