It is grammatically correct to split, but wrong to translate it as you have translated, but would mean like this.



 śaṅkara-prāṇavat-labhe = I get (it)like the life of  śaṅkara.



as labhe is the verb लभे is the first person singular present tense.



śaṅkara-prāṇa-vallabhe = O the dearest one to शङ्करlike his life (or as the free translation goes, deer to his life, to Shankara. - note this is free translation).
