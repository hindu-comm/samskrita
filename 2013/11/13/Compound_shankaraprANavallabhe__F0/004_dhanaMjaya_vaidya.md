Oh how dreadful.  
  
I was tempted to ask if the compund word "translation" in English is to be parsed as "t-ran-slat-ion" meaning "Rightness \[as in 'to the t'\] ran \[on the\] slat \[of a window blind resulting in\] ion\[ization\]".  
  
Though this is a forum to discuss Sanskrit, I wish to better understand the question, which was asked in English, and the word "translation" was used. If the word "translation" is to be understood without strange decomposition and parsing, I would say that "शङ्करप्राणवल्लभे" is also to be understood without strange decomposition and parsing.
