This can also be the case in english. In Shakespeare's Macbeth there is the phrase: "the milk of human kindness" and I can remember my highschool literature teacher explaining that some Shakespearean critics thought it meant "the milk of \<human> \<kindness>" meaning "the essence of the kindness of humans"

and other critics thought it meant "the milk of \<human kind>ness" meaning "the essence of your humanity"
