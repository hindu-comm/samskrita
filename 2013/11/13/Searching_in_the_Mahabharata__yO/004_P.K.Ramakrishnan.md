In the Mahabharata I have the following verse in Vanaparva Ghoshayatra Parva Adhyaya 243 sloka 4 - yudhishthtira says :

  

parai: paribhave praapte vayam panchottaram satam /

parasparavirodhe tu vayam pancha satam tu te //

Please specify the verse or part of verses you are looking for. Otherwise, searching by ideas or stories would be difficult in any link,m unless yourself go through the pages reading verse by verse.

  

It should be available in the Vickipages link Mr.Sundar has given. Please look for the Parvan and section you are looking for.
