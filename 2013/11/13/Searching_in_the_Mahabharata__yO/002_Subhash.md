Thanks for the links.  
This time I am searching for a set of shlokas in the Vana Parva (Ghosha Yatra Parva),  
wherein the Gandharvas have captured Karna & Duryodhana.  
  
Then upon the request of their wives, and YudhishThira's convincing, Arjuna goes to free them.  
His talk with the Gandharvas begins with - Is this an act by you yourself or has Indra sent you स्वमूलकं वा परमूलकं वा  
And then Arjuna says that we may be 100 and 5, but for someone external, we are 105 in toto.  
Gandharvas (ones playing the VeeNA) should set Kauravas free or else, there would remain only one VeeNA in the world- that of Muni Narada  
  
Section 13 in Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vana_Parva>points towards Chapters 235-256  
I checked them but didn't find any sholkas with स्वमूलकं वा परमूलकं वा  
  
So, is the above dialogue in the original Mahabharata, or in some other work based on the Mahabharata?
