When Sahadeva heard that during the peace talks,  
Duryodhana was trying to make Krishna a prisoner,  
he asks Bhima "Does Duryodhana not know that Krishna is Lord himself" ?  
  
Then Bhima replies saying that the Lord is not known to everyone.

This shows that Bhima was not only mighty, but learned too.  
Heis said to have explained something similar toIshaavaasyopanishad's
"तत् दूरे तत् उ अवन्तिके "  
  
I'd like to knowthe exact verse quoted by Bhima.

  
How does one go about searching and zeroing in, on a single incident within the whole Mahabharata?

The text is very voluminous, and I think the above should be in Udyoga parva,

but within that too, is there a way to search easily?
