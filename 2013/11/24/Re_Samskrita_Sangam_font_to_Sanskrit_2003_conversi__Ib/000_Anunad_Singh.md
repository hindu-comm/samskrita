Text in Sangam font can be converted to Unicode Devanagari. I think a free font converter is not available for this. But I can develop a font converter for this if you provide Sangam font and some text in sangam font to test the converter.  
  

Or, if you do not have sangam font, provide some text in sangam font and corresponding text in Unicode Devanagari. With help of this, I will be able to design the converter.
