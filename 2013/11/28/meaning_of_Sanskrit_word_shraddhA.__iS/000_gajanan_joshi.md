Hi All,

  

Can any one of you please give me a meaning of Sanskrit word श्रद्धा.

I definetly know it is not Nishth, Devotion and Faith.

I remember in one discource Shri Panduranga Shastri told that we have even created a word Andha-Shradha without understanding श्रद्धा and It is similar to something "It is a state of a person who is connected to self or GOD"

I do nor remember now what exactly he said.

  

Please reply

  

Regards

  

Gajanan
