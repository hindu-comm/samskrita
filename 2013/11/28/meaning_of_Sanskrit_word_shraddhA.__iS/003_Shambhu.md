Leaving aside the secular meaning in English (faith, Faith, belief, etc.), shraddhA is a devataa personality in Rgiveda 10-151 and it is untranslatable. kAmAyanI shraddhA is given as the RiSikA of this "shraddhA sUktam." Each of the five mantras in it is kind of Her description. Agni is kindled by Her, by Her the havirAhutis reach the devas, the giver is dear to Her. The devas and their chief of yajna, gaurded by vAyu, are drawn near to shraddhA. Through (one's) heart's yearnings ShraddhA and through shraddhA the vasu (wealth) are attained. We invoke shraddhA (devi) in the morning, at noon, and at sunset; O! shraddhA, endow us with shraddhA (You).

  

Griffith (wrongly) brings in "men" in "translating" this sUktam (along with Faith, belief, and such misnomers), but there is nothing in it to imply that it is by men and it is limited to the humans.Just as indra, indrANi, savitA, br\`haspati, agni, vAyu, manyu, etc. are deva or devatA personalities in this created world we jIva-s are in, so is shraddhA. Vaidika narratives followed.

  

medhA, pranjA, and shraddhA Sukta-s are recited (imparted) during the upanayana samskAram, invoking the deva-devatas to come, reside, and strengthen medhA, pranjA, and shraddhA devata-s in the child.
