Dear Sri Abhyankara Kulotpanna Sri Pada ji,

  

Namaste.

  

Your article "Grammatical Proof that Sanskrit was also written" was a good one and thought provoking. Surely, the sutram "MoSnuswaara" is a clear evidence of Sanskrit being written during or prior to Panini.
But, with respect to Avagraha, I am not sure. Is it not that Avagraha is a later insertion in to Sanskrit? There is no mention of Avagraha in Panini sutrams. (though we write avagraha in the monuswara sutram itself). Pls explain.
