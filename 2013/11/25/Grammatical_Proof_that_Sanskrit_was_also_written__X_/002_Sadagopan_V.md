"स्वं रूपं शब्दस्याशब्दसंज्ञा" P.1.1.68 indicates, I understand, "roopam" in shabdashastra refers to pronunciation and not the lipi. I would very much like to know what is the actual pronunciation of anuswara (as in "मोनुस्वारः" P.8.3.23). Surely it should be different from"म्" and "न्" ? How is anuswaara pronounced, especially in cases when " अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः" P.8.4.58. does not operate.



Thanks for help
