Namaste,  
  
Thanks Venetia.  
  
I do teach Sanskrit on every Saturday. It is an on-going class and you are welcome to join anytime. New students can join the beginners' class from 3.30pm-4.30pm. There is also a class from 4.30pm - 5.30pm for students who have studied some basics of reading and speaking and wish to learn further. In this way, you can learn on your own pace and repeat lessons. You are allowed to join both classes if you want.  

  

The class is held in Casa Tropicana, PJ (Petaling Jaya, Malaysia). I do not teach at other times.

  

For further enquiry, feel free to contact me at : [rak...@innerlifeinspire.com]() / [+60122145534](tel:+60%2012-214%205534)  

  

  

Regards,

  

Rakesh
