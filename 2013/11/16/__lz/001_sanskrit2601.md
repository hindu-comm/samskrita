नमस्ते !  

A few suggestions to improve response to your message.  

1.  Can the Language for medium of instruction be English ? 2.  Is the teacher required to teach in a school ? Or Are you planning
    to run a course for interested participants ? 3.  If a course is the plan, how much time can the participants spare
    each day, each week ?  
4.  What is the age-group ? 5.  How many participants in one course ? 6.  What will be the general objective of participants in learning
    Sanskrit ? 7.  Are you looking for the teacher preferably based in Malaysia ? Or
    can you arrange needed facilities for a visiting teacher ?
