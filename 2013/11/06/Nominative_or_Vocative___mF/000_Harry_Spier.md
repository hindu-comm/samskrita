Dear list members,  

  

In the Annapurna stotram all of the names of Annapurna appear to be in the nominative case not the vocative case. Here is verse 10 as an example:

kṣatratrāṇakarī mahābhayakarī mātā kṛpāsāgarī  
sākṣānmokṣakarī sadā zivakarī vidhneśvarī śrīdharī \|  
dakṣākrandakarī nirāmayakarī kāśīpurādhīśvarī  
bhikṣāṁ dehi kṛpāvalambanakarī mātānnapūrṇeśvarī \|\|

  

If these names are in the nominative case then I'm not clear why they're not in the vocative case? 

Is it for metrical reasons?

Can the nominative case be used like a vocative?

Or are the words ending in karī  like  kṣatratrāṇakarī mahābhayakarī etc. in the vocative dual as a sign of respect?

  

Thanks,

Harry
