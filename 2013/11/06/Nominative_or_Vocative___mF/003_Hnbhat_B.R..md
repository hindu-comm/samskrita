This very question has been discussed in this forum in an eaerlier thread and many different answers have been arrived at.

  

  

The very short reply to your question is भवती is a pronoun in the third person, singular in feminine gender and cannot agree with the verb देहि in the second person singular which is त्वम् whether the pronoun is used or not. It is not the case with भवती which requires the subject to be specifically mentioned and take the third person singular only.
