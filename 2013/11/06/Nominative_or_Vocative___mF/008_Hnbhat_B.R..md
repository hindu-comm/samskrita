This is the first reply given by me to the question why it is in the  
Nominative case:  

  
  
  
"They are all nominative singular case, as the adjectives of the  

subject of the verb देहि in the singular second person (त्वम्) भिक्षां  

देहि। and there is no other reasons.  
  

and with more examples by Dhananjaya Vaidya, from other texts with vocative.
