In the case of usage of verbs in the third person, it needs a subject  
noun or pronoun to make the sentence complete and clear. In the case  
of first and second person verbs, it is not needed and the verbs  
themselves imply their subject is second and first person pronoun and  
it is not mandatory. All the above examples above cited, are not  
exceptiohs to the rule, but only used without the corresponding  
pronoun singular not used as per the option, irrespective of whether  
vocative is used or not. But is the case of third person verbs, there  
is no such option and it is warranted to make clear the complete  
sense, about the subject of the verb.  
  
शेषे प्रथमः without exception, warrants the subject verb agreement in  
other case of verbs:  
  
भवती itself warrants third person singular, as it is other than युषत्  
and अस्मत् प्रथमपुरुष suffixes and भवती भिक्षां देहि is syntactically  
wrong.  
In the same way, कृपावलम्बनकरी देहि is also wrong.  
if the third person noun is related with the second person verbal form.
