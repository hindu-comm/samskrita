I don't know why you are trying all the meanings given in a Dictionary, which is dependendent on the context of the usage. Be simple and direct in translation idiomatic to the target language in the similar context as in the original language.

  

Or you will get confused, with trying all the dictionary meaning for the Sanskrit word given for the English Word as you have done and its various idiomatic usages in Sanskrit.

  

Please go through the*Kāraka Prakaraṇa*. of VS Apte'sThe Student\`s Guide to Sanskrit Composition available in this site with example of Sanskrit idiommatic usages equivalents to English sentences:

And note that verbal translation word to word is impossible to convey the same idea in both the languages alike. It will give give a different and some times contradictory or ambiguous sentences many times as you have done.

  

In Sanskrit Concordance of Parts of Speech is important, like the Word Order in English.
