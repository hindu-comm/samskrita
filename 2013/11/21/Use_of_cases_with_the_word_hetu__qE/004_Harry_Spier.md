Thank you Abhyankarji for this example of the use of "hetu" with the "effects" कार्यकारणकर्तृत्वे and भोक्तृत्वे in locative case. 

What had been confusing me was that in the example from Antoines "A Sanskrit Manual" :  

vidhir duḥkhasya hetur bhavati  

the "effect" duḥkha is the genitive to hetu

But in the example from Monier-Williams it is the "cause" which is the genitive to hetu.

mama hetoḥ which he translates as " on account of me "

  

  

Thanks,

Harry Spier
