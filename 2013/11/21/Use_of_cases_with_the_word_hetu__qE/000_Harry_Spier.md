Dear list members:  

  

For the simple sentence "The child is the cause of the mother's happiness"  
I'm not clear from what Monier-Williams says about the proper cases to use with the word "hetu"  
--------------------------------------------  
(H2) hetú \[p= 1303,3\] \[L=264003\]  
m. " impulse " , motive , cause , cause of , reason for (loc. , rarely dat. or gen. ; hetuna, hetoḥ, hetave, hetau , " for a cause or reason " , " by reason of " , " on account of " \[with gen. or comp. e.g. mama hetoḥ or mad-dhetoḥ , " on account of me "\] ; . . . .  
----------------------------------------------  
  
For the simple sentence "The child is the cause of the mother's happiness."  
1) Is the "effect" i.e. "mother's happiness" put in the locative **and can the "cause" i.e. "the child" be put in the nominative like this**:  
**jananyāḥ sukhe hetuḥ śiśuḥ \|**  
OR  
2) Is the "cause" i.e. "the child" ALWAYS put in the genitive (if not compounded) like this:  
**jananyāḥ sukhe śiśor hetuḥ**  
OR  
3) Is he saying the "cause" is put in the genitive ONLY when you use the inflected forms hetunā, hetoḥ, hetave, and hetau.  
and is this a correct use of hetunā :  
**śiśoḥ hetunā jananyāḥ sukham bhavati**  

  

Many thanks,

Harry**
