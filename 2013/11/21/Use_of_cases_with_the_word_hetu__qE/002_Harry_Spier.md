Thank you Dr. Bhat,  

  

Yes you are right. The Monier-Williams dictionary was confusing me. I was going through a Sanskrit Manual for High Schools and it had an example of the use of "hetu" that seemed very straight forward: **vidhir duḥkhasya hetur bhavati **but then when I checked MW while doing an english to sanskrit exercise, what it said about the uses of cases with hetu confused me so I was trying to clear up that doubt. I have Apte's book so thank you very much for that pointer

  

Regards,

Harry
