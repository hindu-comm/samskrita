I am writing this in the background of the current World Championship games being played at Chennai.

  

It is well known that the game of chess originated in India.

It was known as chaturangam. It is to be split as chatur+

angam or four parts.

  

This is what Amarasimha the well knon lexicographer says

about chaturangam:

  

hastyasvarathapaadaatam

senangam syat chatustayam //

  

The four parts of the sena are

hasti (elephant), asva (horse).

ratha (chariot) and foot soldier.

  

They protect the king and the Minister.

  

In the modern chess hasti is named bishop.

asva named the knight. ratha named the rook

and the foot soldier as the pawn.

  

It is unthinkable that a Queen participates in an war. So also

the elephant is called bishop.

  

We do not know who gave these new names.
