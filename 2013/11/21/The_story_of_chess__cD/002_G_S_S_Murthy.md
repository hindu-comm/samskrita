As an adjunct to the ongoing thread of discussion, I may mention the chess-knight's problem, where starting from

one corner a knight has to cover all the cells once and once only. The earliest known solution is in Haravijaya (9th-10th century). One verse reads normally and the solution verse reads as per the knight's movement. Vedanta desika has also used this in Citra-stabaka of Padukasahasra. Prof.Knuth the well known Computer theoretician has researched in this area and has composed a set of verses in English in the same fashion.
