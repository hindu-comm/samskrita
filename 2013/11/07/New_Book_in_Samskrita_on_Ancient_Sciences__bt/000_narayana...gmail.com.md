is due to be released this month end in Bangalore. The attached draft-cover page, the Sanskrit foreword by Dr.S.Y.Wakankar and the foreword in English by Dr.BV Subbarayappa will give a fair idea of the book. Persons interested in the book are requested to send email to Sri.M.S.Santosh at

If you have any comment or specific query please contact me privately.  

  

I will post the invitation to the release function once the details are worked out.

I hope lovers of Sanskrit, Indian culture and history will encourage the book.
