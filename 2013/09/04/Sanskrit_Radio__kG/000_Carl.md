Dear folks,



**Divyavani Sanskrit Radio** - Sri Aurobindo Society -<http://aurosociety.org/focus-area/indian-culture.aspx>

  

Look for radio banner in left pane of above linked page. Click play to listen.  

  

Can be amateurish at times, but an interesting social development.

The chosen content is often contemporary. While I was listening to it, there was a recitation in poetry of "Kargil Lahari" by an Oriya enthusiast. :)

  

Regards,

Carl
