As I understand, it is a problem of rendering and not the error in basic code of the text. The problem has been experienced with various combination of OS and application programs on various indian scripts. The charecteristic symptom is hraswa i_kaar maatraa and the sanyuktaaxaraas. For example, on windows, rendering of Devanagari used to have this problem in Firefox while it was OK in IE. Later, Firefox solved this problem. A second interesting case--> I am using XP. On Hindi wiki and other sites, rendering is flawless but if I go to bengali wiki and change the script from bangla to Devanagari (using FoxRplace, a Firefox add-on), I experience the same problem as experienced by Dr Ram. I know that this code is correct because if I copy the same text and paste it elsewhere, it looks fine.  
  

Now the SOLUTION: On Bengali wikipedia, I have a very small bookmarklet which when clicked, makes the text look fine, but by corrupting the code internaly. Similar thing can be done on Mac-exel using a MACRO. But this should be used for reading the text only, not saving the taxt in this form. This is what we call a jugaaDa or kaamachalaa_oo solution (temp fix). For permanent solution, it should be taken care of at the application level or OS level.  

  

A similar problem is faced on Scribus, the famous opensource DTP software. I propose to use a macro (or script) as a gateway for this problem. The code of the bookmarklet/macro/script is small and simple.

जब भी देश पर विपत्ति, जुल्म, गुलामी की मुसीबत आई है।  
अपनी यह हिंदी ही काम आई है।  
रामानंद और रामानुजाचार्य से लेकर  
अन्ना तक सबने हिंदी ही अपनाई है।
