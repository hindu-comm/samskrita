Namaste All,  
I know this is not directly related to Sanskrit but it is driving me crazy, so thought to ask here for some help.  

I am attaching a screenshot of devanagari text typed in Mac-Excel and Mac-notepad.  
  

First line text typed in Mac-Excel  

Second line typed in Mac-Notepad.  
  

For some reason excel does not render half letters correctly, has anybody saw this issues on their Mac-Excel. I hate to type first in Notepad and then copy into excel.  
  

People sharing their windows experience is not going to help because I do not have a windows machine. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
