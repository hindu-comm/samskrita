hariH OM,  
  

 the same used to happen in windows xp machines if "international language support" weren't enabled in it. but that is history as far as windows is concerned. I am sure that if you port the excel file to any open format and open it in another machine having windows, it will work well. It is just that the software part which makes "dya" appear as dya is absent and hence it appears as half da and ya separate.  
  

 If my xp experience is anything to go by, you can continue typing that without any fear of loss of information and use the final file in a different machine (having gnu or ubuntu). This is the big price to pay to be in such closed propreitary environments... in any case, you should send a request to the creators of mac-excel to improve their software to render indic scripts correctly.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  


shrivathsa.
