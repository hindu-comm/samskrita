नमस्ते –

That seems to be good advice but Microsoft does not recommend using the Mangal font. I consulted with four of their South Asian language developers about five years ago and here is their advice re Mangal:

, Mangal remains the User Interface font because it was designed with the objective of displaying Devanagari clearly at small point sizes within the confines of the text fields for folder names, message boxes, and other features of the system. Modulated fonts such as the Devanagari range in Arial Unicode don’t work as well at the small point sizes required by the User Interface. This is because most screens have only a limited number of pixels at these sizes and so the subtleties of the modulation get lost or blurred.

Given this objective for Mangal, it is clear that it is not a ‘document font’ and was never intended to be beautiful for laying out pages of text for printing books etc. Fortunately, thanks to my colleagues in the Typography team we now have two document fonts for Devanagari: Kokila and Utsaah. Please check out these fonts, I think you will be pleased with them. There is also a display font, Aparajita, which is an elegant typeface for text headers and posters.



For a variety of reasons development of Arial Unicode has been discontinued. Note that Arial Unicode is an MS Office font not a Windows font.



My advice, if it works on a Mac (I am a 100% Windows guy), is to use the Chandas font developed by Mihail Bayaryn. To me it is aesthetically the most beautiful देवनागरी font ever developed; it does a superb job of displaying ‘stacked’ consonant clusters. Here is a link with a description wherein you will find the download link:
