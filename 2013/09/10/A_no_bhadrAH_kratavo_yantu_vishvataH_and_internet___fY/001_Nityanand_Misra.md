"I am told that in Vedic texts one would often find the उपसर्ग (here आ) separated from the verb and put at the beginning of the sentence."

  

This is correct. The उपसर्ग can actually come after the verb also in Vedas. Panini has two rules in Ashtadhyayi to account for this -

  

1-4-81 छन्दसि परेऽपि।

1-4-82 व्यवहिताश्च।



You may want to check commentaries on this verse to see if the accent would dictate any special meaning.
