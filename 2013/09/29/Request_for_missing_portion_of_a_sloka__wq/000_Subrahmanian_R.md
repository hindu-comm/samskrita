Respected Scholars,



I came across portion of a chitra sloka or chatu sloka:



रामात् याचय मेदिनीं धनपतेर्बीजं बालाल्लाङ्गलम् ।

किं नाऽहं तव अन्नदानकरणे स्कन्दोऽस्ति गोरक्षणे ।



The theme is asking Lord Shiva to stop begging and do something, after getting some land from parasurama, some 'finance' from Kubera, a plough from Balarama and Lord Kartikeya can help in grazing cattle.



I will be indebted if some scholar completes the missing portion, corrects spelling mistakes in my above presentation and correct the meaning.



With respects

R Subrahmanian
