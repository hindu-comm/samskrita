In the Yaksha Prasna of Mahabharata, Yaksha asks

Dharmaputra what is the ascharya (wonder) in this

world. He replies -

  

dine dine hi bhootaani pravisanti yamaalayam.

seshaasthaavaramicchanti kimaascharyamatah param.



(Every day living beings enter the abode of Yama.

Others (who are still alive) want to be permanent 

residents of this earth. Is there any other wonder?
