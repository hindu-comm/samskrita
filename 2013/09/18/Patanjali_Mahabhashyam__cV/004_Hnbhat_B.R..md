महाभाष्य is the name of the extensive commentary by Patanjali on Ashtadhyayi of Panini. It is to be noted that no other commentary whether extensive or not on any other work is called by that name. But only by their name, like Shankarabhashya, Ramanjua Bhashya, Madhvabhashya on VedantasUtra-s, Shabarabhashya on Mimamsa, VatsyayanaBhashya on Nyayasutra-s and so on on the Sutra Literature. But only the Bhashya by Patanjali on VyakaraNasutra-s is called Mahabhashya and no other Bhashya on any other sUtra-s is called by that name.
