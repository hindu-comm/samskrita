Namaste Sir

First of all Thankyou so much for review. It was most needed. I wanted to seek help of someone before posting the names. Should have posted it for review first. I am sorry.

I realize it. But Baby names needed to be short. So was trying to pick the meaningful part out of the compound that would give some complete sense. My intention was not solely having a name of Lalita or Durga- It was more intended to be a meaningful Sanskrit name.

Yes Sir. Sorry. Now I see it. It was missed in a hurry. Will rectify it. Always read nAman as napumsaka-Sabda, but failed to bring it in prayoga. Lack of experience.

I understood it as someone ready for some work. Like प्रयत्नशील.. So mistaken.

I realize it Sir. As I said, I saw thatसहस्राभाmakes a complete sense in itself, even apart from the compound- and I picked it up. I shall rectify that.

My view was only to have a Sanskrit word for name. I did not know it is bad practice. Anyway, let me rectify it as per the rules. durgAsahasranAmAni has more small words than long compounds in lalitAsahasranAmAni.

Have not seen much of them myself, so you are the best one to say about it. Someone near had asked me for a name, so I tried these.

I realize it withडाकिनी, hence I did not include it in the list. Yes.राकिणीis a good one to hear also.
