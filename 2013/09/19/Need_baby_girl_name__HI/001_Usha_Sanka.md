Namaste,

Here is a big list of names Baby Girl names from two sahasranAmas- Lalita and Durga.

You may use them. And forward for others too. (Seen carefully for mistakes, if there are any still remaining, please let me know, I will rectify.)

Since a baby can have a name apart from Janma Nakshtra etc. too, which is called vyavahAra nAma, you can choose for her any name that you like.

Regards-

Usha
