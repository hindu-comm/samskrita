Lalitasahasranama is a list of names of full compounds and separating from the items from the compounds may not sound like a name of Lalita or Durga, as intended in the Stotra, but like any word in any dictionary.

  

For your information, ललतासहस्र नामे भ्य- is itself a corrupt form of Sanskrit, which should be if you want it from the thousand names of Lalita,ललतासह स्र-नामभ्यः -

as it is नामन् ending with consonant न् and used in neuter gender.

  

The name in ललतासह स्र-नाम is उद्यद्भानुसहस्राभा meaning one having the shining of thousand suns rising (together) and splitting into two names selected do not mean any thing meaningful.

  

उद्यता -means rising, as a past participle, got up ready for fighting from उद्+यम्.

  

But in the the compound, उद्यद् is adjective for भानुसहस्र as present participle, and your exacted name has nothing to do with this compound. And सहस्राभा doesn't mean anything related with the compound. But only two words coincided together to make a baby name.

  

And so on. I don't know how much care you have taken in choosing the names. Many may sound like the names in other baby name sites online and nothing more as I have shown above.

  

And some may look strange as baby names, like कुण्डलिनी - literally serpent and a shakti in the shape, in the human body. While राकिणी may be a good choice, but डाकिनी would not certainly be, but only applicable to ललिता. While आवृता, सुप्ता, नन्दिता, तोषिता are not more than any participles, meaning, covered, sleeping, pleased, made happy etc. out of the compound, they do not have any relation with the names of Lalita.



 This is just a review of your list of names.
