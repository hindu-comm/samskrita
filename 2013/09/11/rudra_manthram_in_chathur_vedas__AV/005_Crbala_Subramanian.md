Hi Sir  
  
For the rudram stanzas taken from rig veda which is called as Pancha rudras. You can try in Giri Trading Chennai or in Giri Online. they even have the samhita patha and gana patha recited by b.v. suryanarayana bhat ganapadigal(rig vedi). For rudram portion available on atharva veda there is no audio available currently. but there are atharva veda adhyayis available in chrompet and in Sringeri matha and also in coimbatore. So you can ask them to tech you.  
  
  
I do have the bhasya for rudram portion available in four vedas. If possible i will upload it in google drive and share it in this post.  
  
Thanks  
C.R.Bala
