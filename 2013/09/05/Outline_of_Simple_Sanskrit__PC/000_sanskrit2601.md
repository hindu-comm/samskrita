नमांसि सर्वेभ्यः !  
I had been always wondering whether my blog <http://simplesanskrit.wordpress.com/> is on track.  
  

I thought it good to compile an outline of Simple Sanskrit.I just now uploaded it at सरलं संस्कृतम्  
  
This in a way is my syllabus for Simple Sanskrit.  
  

Knowingly I have made it rather elaborate, so that the outline gives even to a fresher some idea of what one should aim to learn even as Simple Sanskrit.  
  

I shall be ever-obliged for all critical comments and suggestions.
