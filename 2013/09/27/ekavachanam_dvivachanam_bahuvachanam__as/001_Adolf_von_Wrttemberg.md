Dear Ramakrishnan,

Yes, Classical (ancient) Greek has singular, dual and plural forms for nouns, adjectives and verbs. For example, the word for “man” is anthropos (ἄνθρωπος) and its nominative case forms in all three numbers are:

ἄνθρωπος ἀνθρώπω ἄνθρωποι

The first person singular, dual and plural number, present tense, active voice, indicative mood forms for the verb “educate” paideuo (παιδεύω) are:

παιδεύω παιδεύετον παιδεύομεν

In a more modern time frame (approximately between 800 – 1200 AD) Old English had a dual number for nouns but not for verbs! We see those dual forms in “Beowulf” and other Old English literature.

विष्णुः



शम् च योश्च ।

(May you have) “Happiness and Welfare”

An ancient Vedic greeting.
