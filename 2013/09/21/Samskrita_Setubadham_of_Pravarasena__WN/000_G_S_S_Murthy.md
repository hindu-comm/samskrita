Dear all,

Setubandham ( also called Ravanavadhah ) is an epic composed in Maharashtri, one of the Prakrit languages, by King Pravarasena. This epic whose subject matter is the story of Yuddhakanda of Ramayana
finds a mention in Kavyadarsa of Dandin, in Harshacharita of Bana and in Auchityavicharacharcha of Kshemendra, making it evident that Pravarasena lived earlier to these three renowned authors. There appear to be four kings by the name Pravarasena, the earliest of whom lived in the first century AD and the second one lived in the second century AD. Two of the four find a mention in Rajatarangini of Kalhana. It is not clear who among the four was the author of this epic. However scholars agree that his time could not be later than 5^(th) century AD.

Ramadasa Bhupati has written a commentary “Ramasetupradipa” in Sanskrit on this epic. Based on this commentary, which has been published by Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan, Varanasi, I have started giving a prose rendering in English along with Prakrit original and its shadow (छाया) in Sanskrit as a serial blog. My rendering in English is circumscribed by the Sanskrit commentary as I do not have any knowledge of Maharashtri. Those who feel interested may periodically visit my blog at

Normally I post a blog containing a few verses once a week.
