In connection with the sloka quoted in this group, I recollect a story which

I had heard long ago. Murari (who later became a famous poet) was

staying in his gurukulam as a student. One day when the students assembled

before the teacher, Murari was missing. The teacher asked another student

to fetch Murari from his room. The student returned and told the teacher

that Murari was sleeping like a log - daarubhuuto murarih. The teacher

asked him to wake him up and bring him to the class. 

  

When thus Murari was brought in front of the teacher he asked him -

daarubhuuto Murarih?

  

Murari replied -

  

ekaa bhaaryaa prakritirachalaa (one wife bhumi with no movement)

chamchalaa cha dvitiiyaa (second wife always on the move) (=lakshmi)

putronangah tribhuvanajayii (son without a body difficult to control)

manmatho durnivaarah /

seahassayya vasatirudakam (seha the serpent is the bed and sea his abode)

vaahanam pannagaarih (his vehicle is garuda the enemy of the serpent)

smaaram smaaram svagrihacharitam (thinking and thinking of his family matters)

daarubhuuto muraarih // (muraari became a log)
