Both the readings change the meaning in the text in active and passive  
voice. There is no problem, as in both the sentence will change  
according to context.  
  
First for variants, you can refer t0 the Critical Edition of Ramayana  
and the editors might have made some notes on the variants. If any  
specific problem need discussion, can be discussed in the group.
