namaste members,  
  
This message is in a sense an extension of the following previous message:  
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/ASPyJk2qCS0/discussion>  
  
  
We are in the process of resolving typo-s/pATha-bheda-s of Sundara  
Kanda text, beginning with the Gita Press edition and have run into  
some difficulties.  
  
We would like to know if any scholars already have looked at this and  
can help. If so, could you please send a private mail?  
  
Also, if any members know of resources on the web (typo-free Sundara  
Kanda etc) which could help in this matter, kindly feel free to point  
us to them.  
  
namaste and dhanyavaadaH  
Ramakrishna
