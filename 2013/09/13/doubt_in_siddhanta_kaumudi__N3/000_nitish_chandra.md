The following are the arguments that came to my mind.  
1.  
Source: नाज्झलौ is before अणुदित्सवर्णास्य चाप्रत्ययः in this book(siddhanta kaumudi). Therefore, the अच् doesn't include all the सवर्णाः, so दीक्षितः says that it is      actually
न+आ+अच्+हलौ so that आ cannot be सवर्ण with other consonants.  
  
My thought: If that were the case, ऊकालोज्झ्रस्वदीर्घप्लुतः is much before अणुदित्सवर्णास्य चाप्रत्ययः and applying the same logic, there would be no ह्रस्व and दीर्घ letters           because there are no आ ई ऊ ... in माहेश्वर सूत्राणि.  
2.  
  
Source: एदैतोरोदौतोश्च न मिथः सावर्ण्यम् because, otherwise पाणिनी would not have kept ए ओ ङ्\| ऐ औ च्\| separately.  
My thought: If we can apply that logic, ऋऌवर्णयोर्मिथः सावर्ण्यं वाच्यम् says that ऋ and ऌ are सवर्णs of each other. Why did पाणिनी mention both of them in different           माहेश्वर सूत्राणि ?  
Obviously I am mistaken somewhere, but I could not find the reasons why my above thoughts are wrong. Scholars can kindly throw some light on these issues.
