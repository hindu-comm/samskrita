In Anjaneya sahasranamavali, one of Hanuman's names is "svara sundara".  
  
The following excerpt may be of interest:  
  
<http://sarathkrishna.blogspot.com/2009/06/sundarakanda-prasasthi.html>  
  
<http://www.indianetwork.org/audio/viswa3.ram> : An audio rendering in Telugu by Viswanatha Pavani Sastri of poems from Ramayana Kalpavruksham by Viswanatha Satyanarayana.  
  
Viswanatha started his sundara kanda in Ramayana Kalpavriksha as  
  
Entavadu kavalenippudu yatpratibha vishistudi  
Antavadini nenagugunippudu tatpratibha vishistudani  
  
It shows the confidence and the confidence that is given by a medicine called Rama Bhakti. So whats Sundaram in Sundara Kanda?  
  
sundare sundaro ramah sundare sundari katha  
sundare sundari sita sundare sundaram vanam,  
sundare sundaram kavyam sundare sundarah kapih  
sundare sundaram mantram sundare kim na sundaram.  
  
1) Rama is sundara. Pumsam Mohana Rupaya --> meaning even men would fall in love with him.  
2) Katha is Sundara. Ramayana is still being received with awe for its beauty of story. It is dharma shastra illustrated  
3) Sita is sundari. It is the reason why Ravan kidnapped her away.  
4) Vanam is Sundaram. Asoka vanam has become resourceful once sorrow of Sita is taken away by Hanuma  
5) Kavyam is sundaram. Ramayana is still being received with awe for its beauty of narration. For example Ayodhya Kanda starts with word Gachchatam --> meaning move. It is a symbolism Valmiki uses to depict something is going to move. By the end of Ayodhya Kanda, Rama/Sita/Lakshmana move to forest. Dasaradha moves to swarga loka. Bharata movs to Nandigrama. Even throne of Ayodhya moves to Nadigrama. This is the skill of valmiki illustrated in Ramayana  
6) Kapih is Sundara. Most temples show hanuman as red colour idol but in reality Hanuma is yellowish colour and very sundara. He is Navavyakarana Pandita and is an illustration how and when to speak.  
7) Mantram is Sundaram. Rama nama is mantra that is althrough in Lanka. You may be surprised but every rakshasha wants to get reward by killing Rama.Even through hate they are reciting Rama mantra. Everytime there is a crisis Hanuman recites Rama nama and gets rid of problem in sundara kanda. So what is not sundaram in Sundara kanda??
