Namaskaram

Sundara was the original name of Hanuman. and before naming the sundara kandam, Sage Valmiki asked

hanuman about the name Sundara kandam, who also okayed the same. When hanuman went home,

that day his Mother Anjana called him Sundara.When asked for the reason, she told Hanuman that he was

christened Sundara but later became Hanuman et al.(this i have heard from Kripananda Variyar in his discourse)

I shall check it up in Kamba ramayanam and update.
