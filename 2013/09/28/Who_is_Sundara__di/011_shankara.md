Namaste,

  

There is one more interesting reason behind the name 'Sundarakanda'. This is given by Kashtajihva Swami in his Ramayana Paricharya as mentioned in Baldev Upadhyaya's "Kashi Ki Panditya Parampara", Uttarabhaga, page 15.

  
It is said that Lanka was situated upon Trikuta mountain which has 3 summits - Nila, Sundara & Subela. Lanka was on the first one, Asokavanika in the second one and the 3rd one has a battlefield. Since Sundarakanda mainly contains the description of Asoka garden which is on Sundarakuta, the Kanda was named Sundara. The author says that this information is taken from Upameru Tantra.  
  



regards  
shankara
