धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता: युयुत्सवः ।  
मामकाः पाण्डवा: च एव किं अकुर्वत संजय ।।१-१।।  
  

In the above shloka the usage of अकुर्वत is लृङ् लकार -  

As per अष्टाध्यायी - अनद्यतने लृङ् (3.2.111) अनद्यतन = that which is not today, भूते अधिकार makes it yesterday or day before. Meaning boils down to in the past other than today.  
If सञ्जय was given दिव्य दृष्टी as the story says then why अकुर्वत could have used any present tense form to see the events live.  

  

Is there any good discussion on this issue, I tried to search the forum & Google but did not get any result.
