Dear Sir  

If you will read Mahabharata, you will find the secret. The fact was that Sanjay had not narrated the events live. He visit Kurukshetra and see the yuddh himself and when he go back then he narrate all the events to the Dhritrastra. The divya dhristi which had received was helpful to give him all minute details of yudh which he had missed.  

You can check mahabharata for same.  

And thatswhy , लृङ् लकार was used here.  
  

regards  
  

Ashish Sharma
