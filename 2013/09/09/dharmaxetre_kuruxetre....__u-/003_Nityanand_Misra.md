Sri Rama Ji

  

The usage is correct. Refer the chapters of the Mahabharata in the Bhishmaparva before the Bhagavadgita. Sanjaya came to meet Dhritarashtra after Bhishma was felled by Arjuna. So the conversation between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya happened after ten days of the war, and hence the use ofलृङ् forअनद्यतनभूत is apt as Dhritarashtra asked about something that happened ten days ago. In fact the entire events of first ten days of war were described after Bhishma's fall by Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.  

  

Refer the following verses in Bhishma Parva chapter 14 (Gita is from chapter 25 to 42) -

  

vaiśaṃpāyana uvāca

atha gāvalgaṇir dhīmān samarād etya saṃjayaḥ

pratyakṣadarśī sarvasya bhūtabhavyabhaviṣyavit

dhyāyate dhṛtarāṣṭrāya sahasopetya duḥkhitaḥ

ācaṣṭa nihataṃ bhīṣmaṃ bharatānāmamadhyamam

saṃjayo'haṃ mahārāja namas te bharatarṣabha

hato bhīṣmaḥ śāṃtanavo bharatānāṃ pitāmahaḥ
