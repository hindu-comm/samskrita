This is the same as posted by Vishvas Vasukeya in his post as from Nityananda, out member:

Note to the Moderators:

  

I don't think repeating the same explanation from another member by other members, indirectly does help in any way for the understanding the form in question in the topic अकुर्वत. Both the messages contain verbatim the same detailed प्रक्रिया by Nityananda. Whether one wants to give detailed प्रक्रिया or simple point to the query is left to one's choice. But repeating the same explanation through other members, I don't know about the status in a forum of such messages repeating verbatim.
