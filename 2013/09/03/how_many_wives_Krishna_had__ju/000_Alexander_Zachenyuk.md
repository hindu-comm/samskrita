Namaste.

I dont understand why there's mention only of 16050 wives of Krishna instead od 16108 or at least 16100 (that 's how many wives he had)

  

5th canto, ch 1

Translation:It is the Yoga Mâyâ that caused Krisna to be transferred from his lying-in chamber

to the village Vraja and then protected him in the house of the cowherd Nanda; afterwards

took him to Mathurâ for the destruction of Kamsa, whence he was led again out of

Jarâsandha's fear to the city Dvârkâ. It is She that created from Her Ownself the eight

Nâikâs (the leading mistresses) and also *sixteen thousand and fifty* women for the pleasure

and enjoyment of Krisna Bhagwân, the incarnation of Ananta (Visnu Bhagavân); thus Krisna

Bhagavân was made completely subservient to them just like a perfect slave. When a young

woman, though she is alone, can bind a man down by the network of Mâyâ, like strong iron

chain, what wonder is there that the sixteen thousand and fifty women would make Krisna

play in their hands like a S’uka bird and make him an instrument to serve any purpose that

they liked. S’rî Krisna got himself so much under the control of Satyabhâmâ that He went

gladly under her commands to Indra's heavens to get the Pârijâta flowers.
