Here is the Vedic references from the Vedic Dictionary:

  

ब्रह्मन्

  

\[L=2207\] \[p= 2-077\]

1\. Brahman (neut.) denotes the priestly class as opposed to

the warrior class and the people (Kṣatra and Viś). The term

is found in the Atharvaveda, \[Footnote: 1) ii. 15, 4; ix. 7, 9; xii. 5, 8; xv. 10,

3, 4.\] and repeatedly later on. \[Footnote: 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 1, 1, etc.;

Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 3; vii. 21, etc.

See also Varṇa and Kṣatra.\] For the

position, etc., of this class, see Brāhmaṇa.

\[L=2208\]

  

2\. Brahman is found in many passages of the Rigveda and

later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda 

  

Now, as for the concept of the word in Upanishadic Philosophy, you can find many references popularlly know Mahavakya-s, describing the concept:

  

सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म (तैत्ति० उप०, २.१.२). "अयमात्मा ब्रह्म" "सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म" ब्रह्मैवेवेदं सर्वम", "एकमेवाद्वितीयं ब्रह्म"

  

ऐतरेय उपनिषद् (3.1.1) 'प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म'

बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् (1.4.10) अहं ब्रह्मास्मि

छान्दोग्य उपनिषद् (6.8.14) 'तत्त्वमसि

माण्डूक्य उपनिषद् 'अयमात्मा ब्रह्म'

etc. and discussed by Badarayana, beginning his discussion with

  

अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा // १/१/१// ब्रह्मसूत्र

  

and commented differently by आचार्य-s before and after Sri Shankara till this date. So it is not a mere dictionary meaning limited to the message of gmail inbox to share the different opinions of different Acharya-s. Yourself have to learn Vedanta texts to understand what they say.
