Namaste All,

I stumbled upon this link

<http://www.wilbourhall.org/index.html#ramayana>  

  

It has Ramayanam in "Sanskrit Prose Version of the Bālakāṇḍa and Ayodhyākāṇḍa "

It has only first two kandas. I was wondering if there are other kandas in such format. Anybody in the group has this and would care to share it.

  

I could not find it through google search.

Author is Kalluri Hanumanth Rao.

धन्यवाद: - राम
