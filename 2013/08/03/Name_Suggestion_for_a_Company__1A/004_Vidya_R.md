Namaste Shri Uday Sagar!

  

This group is meant for sharing Samskrita knowledge - at all levels. If you are new, welcome. If you have been a member, you would already have seen related posts. This group has found that answering questions about naming babies is very tricky - generally it is the case of "adjusting the head according to the hat". Posters just want their chosen word to be "Stamped Sanskrit" irrespective of its eligibility. There is really not much "real Sanskrit" involved.

  

\>\>\>\>\> #1 Is there any term named "prithwheel" in sanskrit? If not, how to interpret it in pure sanskrit.

This point (#1) is screaming to be addressed - Here I go ... 
Especially the second half. If one wants to combine Sanskrit and English, one is at liberty to do so. But one should stop there.
Finding an interpretation for this hybrid word in "pure Sanskrit" is a mockery of Sanskrit / people who know Sanskrit / unsuspecting world that will gobble up the reasoning. 

  

CAUTION! I am on a roll.

Loosely referring, it is probably similar to how "Hamilton bridge" became 'Tamizhized" to "ambaTTan bridge" (ambaTTan is Tamizh for barber), and then "pundits" try to explain how this bridge used to be lined with barbers squatting on their haunches shaving the heads of chaste brahmins who would otherwise not deign to give them the time of day. And, there will be a horde of people who will eagerly pounce on brahmins or barbers or whatever else... And the very specific reason why this particular task could be done only on a bridge (water reference) and not anywhere else ...

END CAUTION!

  

That said, you may find justification for any word that you may come up with. Mahabhashyam, a commentary on a Sanskrit grammar text, states that (as I understand it) one can never rule out the validity of any given sound just because we can't find a meaning for it. It could have been explained in / by any of the innumerable texts that have gone missing.

  

Another illustration - the only relevance is that there is a potter's wheel involved.

(On second thoughts, it actually may have a relevance to this post!)

  

I wish your friend the most success - may he prosper. May the Earth be nurtured ...
