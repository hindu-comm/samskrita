Hi All,

  

My friend wants to start a business on earthenware products. We have been looking for the names from the past 40-50 days. Our theme is that the name should include the terms- "earth" coupled with any of the pottery jargon. Recently we have come up with "prithvi" and "wheel" (from fly-wheel) and thought of making it "prithwheel". It's a good blend of sanskrit and english terms. :-)

I have two queries-

#1 Is there any term named "prithwheel" in sanskrit? If not, how to interpret it in pure sanskrit.

#2 Can you suggest some names(earth is must) for our company?

  

Thanks & Regards,

Uday Sagar.
