Hi All,

  

I am sorry to ask my query at the wrong place. I will convey your suggestions, kecharchakra, mrtsnachakra to my friend.

  

Madam, I like your words-

*That said, you may find justification for any word that you may come up with. Mahabhashyam, a commentary on a Sanskrit grammar text, states that (as I understand it) one can never rule out the validity of any given sound just because we can't find a meaning for it. It could have been explained in / by any of the innumerable texts that have gone missing.*  

  

And I thank all for your well wishes on our company.  

  

Regards,

Uday Sagar.
