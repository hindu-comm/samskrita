ear Friends ,  
  
I am looking for a Sanskrit equivalent to Cognitive Bias . Later I want to find if Nyaya is attached with this word . Please help .  
  

Cognitive Bias is defined as systematic deviations from a standard of [rationality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality") or good judgment



.  

  

Cognition can be translated into Sanskrit as Pravritti or Anubhav or Upalabdhi while bias can be translated as Abhinati or Pravanayita . I am looking whether a single word already exists for Cognitive Bias in Sanskrit . Please help .

  
  

An Example of Cognitive Bias : I went by rickshaw ten times . I believe I was overcharged on one occasion . I become extra careful in my rickshaw travels checking on the meter twice .
