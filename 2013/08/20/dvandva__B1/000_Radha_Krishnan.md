Dear All,

Namaste.

  

Somewhere I happened to see the following line.

  

श्रोत्रत्वक्चक्षुर्जिह्वाघ्राणानि ज्ञानेन्द्रियाणि ।  

  

The first word is a dvandva samasa. In dvandva samasa,सुप् is dropped from individual members and thenसुप् is added in the end. But, in the above line,सुप् is not dropped from the wordचक्षु: . Can anyone guide me in this?

With regards,

RK
