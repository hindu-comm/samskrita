Here is the explanation of Ujjvaladatta on the issue of त् in the word:

Once again, I am posting inline image of Shvetavanavasin, on the above sUtra and the word:

In continuation of my earlier post, गायत्र or गायत्री, गायत्रा can be having single or double त् for difference in the derivation:

  

गायन्तं त्रायते इति गायत्+त्र - गायत्त्र, गायत्त्री;

गायनं गायः, भावे घञ्, यागेन त्रायते इति गाय+ त्र - गायत्र।

and as in the case of पुत्र,

  

the single त् can be doubled by "अनचि च" here also, which gives in both cases double त्. In one case it is optionally doubled, in the other it is double त् due to the derivation.
