Pāṇini has a rule for optionally adding a consonant if no vowel is following immediately after that (8.4.47), however I do not know a rule about optionally deleting a consonant. I am not much cognizant about Pāṇinian system. May be Bhat sir or Nityanandaji can shed light on this. Mugdha-bodha Vyākaraṇa, however, has a rule about optionally deleting a consonant but currently I do not remember the rule. If anyone, who is aware of this grammar, please mention the rule and explanation.
