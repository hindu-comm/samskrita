Respected HBHat,

  

Thank you for providing good explanation.

  

As I provided l;ink to previous discussion. If you refer to Gurugita shlokas 112,160 , it have same reference of Jatipuspa. See below shlokas ( I regret if those does not shows well due to font problem)

हृदम्बुजे कर्णिकमध्यसंस्थेसिंहासने संस्थितदिव्यमूर्तिम्।ध्यायेद्गुरुं चन्द्रकलाप्रकाशम्सच्चित्सुखाभीष्टवरं दधानम् ॥112॥

अंगुष्ठमात्रं पुरुषंध्यायेच्च चिन्मयं हृदि ।तत्र स्फुरति यो भाव: श्रुणु तत्कथयामि ते ॥ 160॥

समुद्रे वै यथा तोयं क्षीरे क्षीरं जले जलम् ।भिन्ने कुम्भे यथाकाशं तथाऽऽत्मा परमात्मनि ॥ 250॥

तथैव ज्ञानवान् जीव: परमात्मनि सर्वदा ।ऐक्येन रमते ज्ञानी यत्र कुत्र दिवानिशम् ॥ 251॥

जलानां सागरो राजा यथा भवति पार्वति ।गुरूणां तत्र सर्वेषां राजायं परमो गुरु: ॥ 288॥

  

Now regarding "vidheha-mukti" . When yogi / any person control "mind (mana) " with Prana-vayu. It makes stop all nadis which goes to "9" parts of body. As per Samkya-yoga our body made of 24 tatvas.

  

25th is different from 24 tatvas . Thats 25th is "Brahma-Tatva" or spirit which resides in our soul . But only to reach to that spirit is through "Susumna-nadi" . Now when all other nadi stops then only "Jati-puspa" (shape) soul layer gets open and spirit come out of it , which makes feel Yogi / person like "videha-mukti" cause that spirit does not have any "Maya-tatvas" (24). Then that spirit which known as "Brahm-Tatva" can be made feel only but can not seen. And yogi's / rishis who saw it (cannot see by our eyes of 24 tatvas) made some example of our known objects ( like taila-tila and flower) to make us understand about it.

  

This "brahm-tatva" (spirit) is part of "Parmatma" just like sun-rays are part of SUN, but SUN and SUN-Rays are different. SUN is only one , but SUN reaches to everywhere using its SUN-rays. Same explained in Veda and Samkya-yoga and by founders of other religions. We all have "Brahma-Tatva" in us covered with "Maya-tatva" soul when "Maya-Tatva" layers cuts and then when "brahm-Tatva" (spirit) getsdissolvesin Parmatma , its known as Moksha.

  

Please regret me , if I have made any mistake in explaination.

  

Thanks,

glade
