taitila is a karaNa name in jyotiSa. Here<http://vedicastrology-prognosis.blogspot.com/2010/05/karana-usage-in-astrology.html>and <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ancient_astrology/02CKGn4E8Kk/BXRZeK_jVbkJ> it is noted as originated from titir (tittiri?) of taittirIya, implying a very exalted state or position. It's meaning as ass or rhinoceros appears to be from Tamil (equating the karaNa names) injected into Samskritam.

  

"Cultural Profile of South Kosala" by J. P. Simhadeba cites aStAdhyAyI 6-2-42 for taitila as a janapada adjoining kaliGga. taitila (taitilam) as kalinGa is possibly later history/geography scribes' mixup. I wonder if"God" is due to bad translation of recent times - nothing connected to the notion of "God" is in the Vedic thought.

  

Aren't we left with only one meaning: A highly exalted, respectworthy, raised state or position?
