Respected scholars ,

  

I might extracting meaning wrongly but trying my level best. Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

verse 19 says :  

**Jaati-puspa-samaa-yoger-yatha vaasyati taitilam**

  

1\) here as per dictionary "vasya" also means "enveloped"/"covered"

2\) Yatha Jaati-puspa means "just like jasmine flower "

  

Considering point 1 and 2 verse means : Just like jasmine flower in conjuction covering taitilam.

  

Thanks,

glade
