I recently completed my own translation of the kshurika Upanishad, which includes these verses:



In between these two is that supreme place (*sushumna*). He who knows of it knows the Veda. The 72,000 among the nadis \[will lead to the\] taitilam (?). He cuts them by the yoga of meditation, which is a powerful razor, fiery and spotless. Only one, *sushumna*, shouldnâ€™t be cut off. At that time the yogi can see the taitilam, which is like a jasmine flower.



can anyone help me find a translation for taitilam?

thank you. Richard Rosen
