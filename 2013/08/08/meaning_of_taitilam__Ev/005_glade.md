Respected Scholars,

  

Here taila-tilam is refers to "spirit" (brahm-Tatva) reside inside "soul" (our soul consist of Maya-Tatva but not body) . So taila-tilam is example given to explain about how spirit reside in soul just like "taila" (oil) reside in "tila" .

  

More information you can find in previous discussion
