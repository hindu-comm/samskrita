I am not any Yogin or Brahmajnani for offering any explanation of my own. I can the best translate what Brahmananda Yogin has interpreted from the verse:

  

When the Yogin, has restricted the movement of प्राणवायु in other नाडी-s other than the कैवल्यनाडी (सुषुम्ना नाडी probably), he attains the goal of his effort. (कृतकृत्य) as it is explained in the verse \[like this\]

  

When the Yogin has acquired the required status, as instructed in the first half, he like the identity with Jati flower, (in fragrance), sees the stability of the sight, mind and प्राण in the कैवल्यनाडी, he becomes विदेहमुक्त (I do not translate this without the technical meaning restricted to the respective schools of Philosophy). According to Advaita, this term has been defined as follows in SarvavedantaSara Sangraha:

  

विदेहमुक्तिः. = जीवन्मुक्तिपदं त्यक्त्वा स्वदेहे कालसात्कृते । विश्त्यदेहमुक्तित्वं पवनोऽस्पन्दतामिव ॥९७९॥ 

  

You can yourself check the complete explanation of the term in the following link:
