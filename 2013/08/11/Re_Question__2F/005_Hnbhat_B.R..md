ok. Thank you all.

  

Some of those got on search, have Inscript keyboards and auto filling of the words, I have not tried the keyboard.

  

I got a Devanagari Editor, from which directly the message could be sent to mail to any address and it has got convenient input method. But as usual, while installing these, they show warning that theese may collect our personal informations like credit card numbers, bank account and may be stored passwords. So I had the question, is it safe to use these apparatus?
