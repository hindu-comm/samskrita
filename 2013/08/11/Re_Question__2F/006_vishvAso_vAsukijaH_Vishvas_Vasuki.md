Excellent question. Yes - you're taking a risk (that is, trusting the app-publisher not to be malicious) - you should do so only if you think the benefits are worth it - or you could go with someone you trust not to collect unnecessary financial data (such as <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inputmethod.hindi> ). Most keyboard-programmers are not malicious, though.
