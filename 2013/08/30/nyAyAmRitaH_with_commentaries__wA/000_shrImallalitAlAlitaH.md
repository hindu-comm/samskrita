Please see this link below:  
<http://www.printsasia.com/book/nyayamrtam-of-sri-vyasatirth-with-advaita-siddhi-of-madhusudana-saraswati-and-the-commentaries-of-nyayamrta>  
  
Please, help me to find and get either print or PDF of this book. I need it for my studies. I'm currently studying advaita-siddhiH and need nyAyAmR^itaH and it's commentary to correctly understand both views.  
  
saurabha TIkA is also mentioned in this page:

I will be glad to hear anything about this commentary too.
