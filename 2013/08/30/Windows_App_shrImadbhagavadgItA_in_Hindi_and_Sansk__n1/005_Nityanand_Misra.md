Good work but I have some questions. From the snapshots which showed the first two verses, the Hindi translation is the exactly (word for word) the same as that of Gita Press. Compare from here<http://www.gitapress.org/BOOKS/GITA/18/18_Gita.pdf>

  

Can you confirm if the entire app has the same word for word translation of Gita Press's edition? Have you taken their permission? If not, is thisnot copyright violation of Gita Press's content?

  

If the translation is available for free then I am sure nobody would mind (not even Gita Press), but if one has to pay for the last 12 chapters and the the last 12 chapters also use Gita Press's copyrightedtranslationword for wordwithout their permission then I am afraid to say this is not fair.
