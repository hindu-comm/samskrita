Why should you make it a problem? Since they are found in two different sources as yourself have stated, there are bound to be some difference of the thousand names in count and identical names too. It is not at all a problem for the readers. You can chose one and follow it, but need not combine and get confused in them as a problem. \]

  

If you have got any doubts or problems in understanding any one of the names, you can ask for a solution or understanding.
