Namaskaram to all Scholors,  
  
I have 2 types of sudarshana sahasranamam.  
one from ahirbudnya samhita anoher one vihageshwara samhita.  
  
Most of the people are chanting Sudarshna sahasranam from Vihageshwara samhita.  
I have two Hard copy of that and one soft copy from [prapatti.com](http://prapatti.com).  
  
My problem is that In each of the copy some words are different that  
means spelling is different.  
  
So Please help me to find original Sudarshana sahasranam from  
vihageshwara samhita.  
  
DhanyavaadaaH,
