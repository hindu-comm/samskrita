Respected Bhat Sir,  
First, my apology for not sighting your mail of the 16th August.  
Second, thank you very much for the detailed explanation.  
The reason for my repeat request was that since I had not seen your mail of the 16th (of course due my fault), I had asked some local Sanskrit teachers who attributed my query in question to 'poetic freedom' used by the poet, and I could not easily accept that; and that is why I repeated my request. Sorry once again.  
The most important lesson I have learnt from your detailed explanation is that since there is no ''च' /ch/ after the samaahaara  
'saangapadakramopanishadaiH', it is not vedaiH and 'saangapadakramopanishadaiH' but it is an adjective for 'vedaiH'. A great lesson for finer reading. Thanks a million for this golden lesson.  
Regards...Shreyas
