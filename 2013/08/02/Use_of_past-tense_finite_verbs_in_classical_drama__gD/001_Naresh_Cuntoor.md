From my limited reading, it seems to be a similar story in several Bhasa's dramas as well. kartari / karmaNi kta is used quite frequently and not lakaaras. Same thing in Venisamhara of Bhatta Narayana who is of a different vintage.  
  

It seems like gadya granthas use lakaaras much more. I remember seeing a whole lot of liT in Bhoja Prabandha of Ballala Deva. If memory serves, he is in the same ballpark (+/- 200 years say) as Bhatta Narayana.
