Thank you everybody for your help

  

Dr. Bhatji,

Initially I just wanted to know the mantra and source, now I am curious to know more about it. Sayana Bhashya is great and I did not read Vidyaji blog, because of access issue but will read soon.

Any other information that you can add would be helpful too.

  

Thanks for your time

Regards

Raama
