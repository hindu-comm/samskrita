Sorry for not noticing the typo error in my earlier message, only just now noticed:

  

>

> > चत्वारि वाक् परिमिता पदानि तानि विदुब्राह्मणा ये मनीषिण:। गुहा त्रीणि > निहिता नेङ्गयन्ति तुरीयं वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति। (ऋग्वेद-1-164-45)  
> >

Please read विदुर्ब्राह्मणा for the highlighted text in red in the मन्त्र.

The following are the abbreviations  used above:

  

AVÇ. Atharva-Veda-Saµhitå, Çåunaka recension  



ÇBÇatapathabrabhmana\\\\

*AS - Asvalayana SrautasUtra.*

*JUB. Jåiminîya-Upanißad-Bråhma±a*  

  

These are in addition to the one referred by Vidya in her message, found in Mahabhashya, which also has got a beautiful explanation applying the mantra, to Vak grammatically referring to the parts of speech. Anyhow you seem not to be interested in the commentaries or different interpretations. It has been commented in Nirukta also different classification in 4. A member has already attached Sayana's commentary in his reply.

  

  

With regards
