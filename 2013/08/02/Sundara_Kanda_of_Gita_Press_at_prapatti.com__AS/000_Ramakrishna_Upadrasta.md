namaste to members of this group,  
  
Sometime back, a query had been posted here about online availability  
of Sundara-Kanda of Ramayana.  
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/G3z9vLG6ybU>  
  
The above query was about availability of uttara-pATha (if that is the  
correct term) of Sundara Kanda. More specifically, it was about online  
availability of the version in the famous Gita Press Gorakhpur books,  
which is widely used in India in paaraayaNa-s.  
  
Recently, due to the efforts of Shri. Sunder Kidambi, the above query  
has been answered positively. The entire Sundara Kanda (all 68 sargas  
of it) is available at <http://www.prapatti.com> at the following link  
<http://prapatti.com/slokas/category/s-raamaayanam-sundarakaandam-index.html>  
  
Hope these files are useful for scholars, saadhakaa-s and learners. I  
have gone through a couple of sarga-s and have found them typo-free.  
One of the nice aspect of the above webpage is that is gives the PDF  
files of the text in different scripts: Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, etc.,  
so that even saadhaka-s who cannot read devanaagari can use the above  
work in their script. For example, the Telugu Sundara Kanda is at  
<http://prapatti.com/slokas/category/t-raamaayanam-sundarakaandam-index.html>  
The link to change to the relevant script is at the bottom of the page.  
  
Members/scholars of this group could send their appreciations to Shri  
Sunder Kidambi \<[sunder....@gmail.com]()\>. It seems that the effort  
took 6-7 months of effort, which indeed is a lot.  
  
namaste  
Ramakrishna
