That's OK. But, even then चतुर्थीप्रयोग is not *aprasiddha* or *bAdhita.

Anyway, going with main stream is advisable.

The rule of वाक्यभेदस्यान्याय्यत्वम् doesn't essentially apply here because we are not bringing desired words (अध्याहार) to get the meaning. We are considering that we have two readings and we have to establish अन्वय to justify the readings.  

Again, It is not a rule that in a single shloka there must be a single vAkya.  

Moreover, प्रणतः will create a separate sentence allowing नमो नमः to complete it's own. So, here are two vAkya-s, and it is definitely not a case of deriving two meanings from a single vAkya by adhyAhAra, etc.  
  

But, in the case we have no variant reading, everything which N Mishra said will apply.  

The person who told you that both are tenable and me, both are taking it granted that such variance of reading actually exists. If it doesn't, then the reading which exists or is popular, is to be accepted.
