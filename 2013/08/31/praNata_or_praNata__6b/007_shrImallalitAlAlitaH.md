Yes, I just saw the original and it's commentaries.  

Some *vaiShNava*-s hold this *shloka* as *mantra* and they have give it's *R^iShyAdi* in *TIkA*.  

So, *praNatakleshanAshAya* is the original reading from *bhAgavatam*.  

And, hence the quest of which is correct and how will be *anvaya* ends here.
