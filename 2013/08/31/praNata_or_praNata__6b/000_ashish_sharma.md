Dear All Learned Scholars and Guruvars  
There is a stuti on krishna:

  
कृष्णाय वासुदेवाय हरये परमात्मने***प्रणत: क्लेश्नाशाय***गोविन्दाय नमो नमः \|  
  
Few learned told me that instead of ***प्रणत:****,**it should be **प्रणत**** .** Therefore, I had contacted great scholar from this group and he had told me that both are correct giving different meanings.*

*I request you that kindly give me the meanings and justification that which one is correct and why whether its **प्रणत:**** **or **प्रणत**** **or both.*

*Regards*
