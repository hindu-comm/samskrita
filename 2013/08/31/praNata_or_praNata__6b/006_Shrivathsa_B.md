hariH OM,  

lalitAlAlita svAmin,  
  

 the verse is from shriimadbhAgavatam, 10.73.16. I went through a number of commentaries made available to us through bhagavat vidyapith (available in [archive.org](http://archive.org)) and found that the reading of praNataklesha (without visarga) is the one which is used in all the Tikas available therein.  
  

 Even gita press copy has the non-visarga reading.  

  
svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  


shrivathsa.
