This is an issue with page encoding. As previously said, you need to override the encoding and set it to something similar to ISO-8859-1. Better still you can install 'Padma' extension (for firefox) \[<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/padma/>\], which converts legacy and proprietary encoding' into plain Unicode.
