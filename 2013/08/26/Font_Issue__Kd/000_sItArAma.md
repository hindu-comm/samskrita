Namaste,  
This could be unrelated but thought to see if anyone else over came this issue.  
I have Macbook and I could not open this site in "Safari" or "Firefox"  
I looked at the webpage source and it seems to be using this font "FONT FACE="DV-TTYogesh">   
  
<http://www.wilbourhall.org/sansknet/vyakaranam/vakya_padiyam/brahma_kandam.htm>  
  

I installed this font yet I can not see the website in devanagari text. Also restarted the system and browser but no luck. I am attaching a screenshot of how it appears on my computer.  
  
I was wondering if anyone else can see this website in Devanagari.  
-- धन्यवाद: - राम
