Learned scholars,

I have come across two version of a quote. It strikes me that one of these probably follows the necessary metre correctly, while the other may not:

ऐश्वर्यस्य समग्रस्य

वीर्यस्य यशसः श्रियः \|

ज्ञान-वैराग्ययोश् चैव

षण्णां भाग इतीङ्गना \|\|

This above is how the verse appears as Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.74 . Here is the same verse as quoted in Adi Shankara’s Sānatsujātīya Bhāṣya:

ऐश्वर्यस्य समग्रस्य

वीर्यस्य यशसः श्रियः \|

ज्ञान-वैराग्ययोश् चैव

षण्णां भग इतीङ्गना \|\|

Please note the only difference: भाग versus भग, in the final line. 

Which of these choices is best in terms of metre and/or syllable count?

(And I am vaguely aware of three ways to look at metre, as **अक्षरवृत्त **or **वर्णवृत्त** or **मात्रावृत्त** . But I know little about these concepts. Does one or the other apply here? How does one choose between them, assuming that one or another applies?)

Thanks in advance for any help someone among you may offer,

Brian
