Brian,

  

This humble scribe has posted on youtube a 15-minute video which explains in brief the basic concepts of meters employed in Sanskrit Kavyas and illustrated 31 popular meters with recitationsas students are taught to recite them in schools. The illustrations are drawn from various Sanskrit works.
