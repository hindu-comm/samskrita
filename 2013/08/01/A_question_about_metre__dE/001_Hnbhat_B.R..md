Most probably the first is a print mistake, as the verse seems to define the word भग in the word भगवान् from the contexts I have come across and there is no possibility for such a reading भाग even if metrically suits.

  

Here is the same version appearing in website:

  

ऐश्वर्यस्य समग्रस्यवीर्यस्य यशसः श्रियः \| ज्ञानवैराग्ययोश्चैव **षण्णां भग इतीरणा \|**\| —विष्णु पुराण ,६/५/७४  

  

This has been discussed in this group in this thread:
