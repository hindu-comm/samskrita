Hello, here you can find a version of the first book of the Hitopadeśa with devanāgarī text, translation and grammatical analysis by Max Müller  
  
<http://archive.org/details/firstbookofhitop00ml>  
  

and here you can find different versions in devanāgarī, as well as translations  
  
<http://archive.org/search.php?query=hitopadesa>  
  

Good luck
