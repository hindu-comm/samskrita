I have gone through your review where you refer to Medeleev having been inspired by Panini in his approach to forming the periodic table. I have also read through the paper by Prof.Kak which was circulated in this thread.

I am inclined to agree with Prof.Kak's view that it is unlikely that Mendeleev was inspired by Maheswara sutra of Panini. But there is an uncanny resemblance between periodic table and 5x5 consonant table of Sanskrit. May be Bohtlink told him about it. As for his use of eka, dvi prefix for then unknown elements, he just used the Sanskrit words for one and two as prefix.

Regards

Murthy
