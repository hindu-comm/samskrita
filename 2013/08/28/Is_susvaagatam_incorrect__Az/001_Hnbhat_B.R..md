If you can give an authority of the usage, we can consider it of giving an authoritative answer with grammatical reference.

  

For the time being, you can refer to this discussion long ago held in our group, if you had missed it:

Anyhow, in my opinion, there is no meaning "very welcome" unless wellcome itself is conveyed by स्वागतम्, if one wants to add "very" to make the word स्वागतम्, with one more prefix सु, grammar has no objection to the form. But as it is remarked in one of the messages, it is used in मन्त्र-s inviting forefathers at पितृकार्य, for which he has not given any reference to any authentic source.

  

In this link, there is a such word used in Ramayana of Valmiki, but probably it is not used in the same sense as very well-come (a coined splitting of welcome).

Now after reading the messages in the thread, you can put forward your own opinion.
