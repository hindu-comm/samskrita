There is a question that susvaagatam means "good welcome greeting from you", not "very welcome".  
  

When a double su upasarga attaches to a padam, should it be interpreted as  

su-(su-aagatam) = su-(svaagatam) = su-"welcome" = good "welcome",  

or  

su+su - (aagatam) = very well "come" or very welcome?  
  

I need an authoritative answer with grammatical reference.  

Thanks,  

\- Sai.
