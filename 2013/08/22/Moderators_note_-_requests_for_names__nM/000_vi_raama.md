Namaste to all!

  

Requests for names are a necessary part of the activities of this group, even if not relished by a few or many or all members. Many times, names are what cause people to turn to Samskrita.  Requests do come in. So, we have decided instead, to restrict the responses- Please respond with options for names directly to the poster. Those not interested in making suggestions may please ignore such requests.

  

Any bhASHA related discussion (when not dealing with the naming of newborns or soon-to-be-borns ... ) of any given name,(as occurs in literature) is acceptable.
