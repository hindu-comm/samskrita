In other words, kSata in Ragu's etymology stands for the etymologically derived from verb kSaN \> kSat \>

  

and hence is an explanation of the word and not the grammatically perfect etymological derivation as given bY Sri Mishra.

  

I am not sure of the grammatical etymology given by Mishra. KShaNu hiMsAyAm is the root. Right now I could not check.In my opinion, there is no tuk, but only N the anunasika, is changed into "t". For more details, the word can be looked in the Kridantarupamala, under the root. whether kSattra.

  

Right now I cannot access my resources.
