sarvāpahāra means taking everything away. sarvāpahāralopa is a technical term in Paninian process which means all the elements (syllables) of the Pratyaya are elided. This applies to suffixes like *kvip* (क्विँप्), *cvi* (च्विँ), ślu (श्लुँ) and some other suffixes.

For *kvip*, the *k*, *i* and *p* are indicatory. The vowel sound *i* is nasal.  

1.  *k* is indicatory due to 1-3-8 *laśakvataddhite* 2.  *i* is indicatory due to 1-3-2 upadeśe'janunāsika it  
3.  *p* is indicatory due to 1-3-3 *halantyam*

All three are elided by *1-3-9 tasya lopaḥ*, and only *v* is left.  

kṣaṇ kvip -> anubandhalopa -> kṣaṇ v

Now the single-syllable suffix *v* gets the *apṛkta* noun by *1-2-41 apṛkta ekāl pratyayaḥ*. The *apṛkta v* is elided by the rule *6-1-67 verapṛktasya*. This is called sarvāpahāralopa  
  
kṣan v -> kṣaṇ  
  

However, in spite of the entire suffix being elided, the suffix-hood is not destroyed due to *1-1-62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam.* As a result, *kṣaṇ* which becomes *kṣat* as shown earlier, gets the *prātipadika* noun from *1-2-46 kṛttaddhitasamāsāśca* and can participate in a compound like *kṣataḥ trāyate iti kṣattraḥ*

Any more doubts?
