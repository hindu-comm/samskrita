Murthyji,

"vaade vaade tattvabodhaH".  Yes, definitely it helps for more clarity and realisation of the tattva.  In India, Samskrit is treated and respected as a classical language and adored speaking about the richness of the language in English or in other local languages.  But they don't encourage the children

to study Samskrit and become proficient in the language.  Instead, they encourage them in taking a foreign language like French, Japanese, Chinese etc at college levels.  Govts., Central/states, also encourage the students to take some foreign language or the regional language instead of Samskrit.

There are some Official Language Commission Chairmen, who feel that the regional language is neglected, by chosing Samskrit by the students at Intermediate and graduation levels.

Only the Samskrit Universities in the country and Samskrita Bharathi are striving to take the language to the people who are interested in it. 
I may say, Samskrita Bharathi is the only NGO, that breaks its nerves to bring the people to the 10-day sibirams to make them capable of speaking in Samskrit in 10 days.  Regards.

D.Ramakrishnan.
