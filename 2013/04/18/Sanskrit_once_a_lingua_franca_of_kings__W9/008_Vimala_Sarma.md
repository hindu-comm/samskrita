Dear Shastry Mahodaya

By definition the prakrits were spoken languages while Sanskrit was the literary language. So there was no literature from non-Buddhist sources at the time. Also another factor causing confusion is that the words "Sanskrit" (elaborated or refined) and "Prakrit" (natural) were not in use, so there was no way of distinguishing the high language from degenerate forms, which were considered by then grammarians as all variants of the same language. However the word apabhramsha (degenerate ) was in use and of course this did concern the grammarians who of course wanted everyone to speak the high form.



There have been recent discoveries of Buddhist manuscripts written on birch bark sequestered in pots and donated to monasteries from the Svat Valley and in Afghanistan. These original documents date from the beginning of the first millennium 0-200 CE and are manuscripts written in the Prakrit Gandhari and is good evidence of what was spoken in that region at the time. These are currently held in the British Museum and with a private collector - the Senior Manuscripts- and are currently being worked on by the Early Buddhist Manuscript Project in Seattle University, which include Richard Saloman and Mark Allon (from Sydney University).
