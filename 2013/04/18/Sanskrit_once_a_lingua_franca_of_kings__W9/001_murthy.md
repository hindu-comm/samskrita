I for one do not believe that Sanskrit was ever the spoken language of  
common people. It was an elite language (samskrutam) used by the elite in  
contrast to the common natural languages (prakrutam). Even in Sanskrit plays  
the common folk use prakrut while the elite use Sanskrit.

Sanskrit, once a lingua franca of kings

The language Sanskrit was once used as a lingua franca all over the  
nation during the ancient and medieval era. Most of the inscriptions  
of those days were in Sanskrit and those inscriptions were found in  
large numbers in Tamil Nadu, said Dr Chitra Madhavan, a noted  
historian, here on Thursday.  
  

Delivering the lecture on ï¿½Sanskrit inscriptions in Tamil Naduï¿½ at the  
monthly lecture organised by Tamil Valarchi Kazhagam, she said, ï¿½From  
the Pallava dynasty to the Maratha dynasty, which ruled Tamil Nadu ï¿½  

Sanskrit inscriptions were used, since it was widely followed and the  

mother tongue of each dynasty was different from others.ï¿½  
  
ï¿½Through the inscriptions, one can know about the political geography,  
culture, administration, economy, etc., of these periods,ï¿½ she said.  

  
She added that most of the inscriptions were found in temples, which  
indicated that the donations were made by the kings. One can find  
inscriptions that are centuries old at Thiruparuthikundram near  

Kanchipuram.ï¿½  
  
ï¿½Interestingly some of the inscriptions found in Gangai Konda  

Cholapuram tell us that kings from the Northern parts of India also  

made their contributions through these donations,ï¿½ she added.  
  
She said, ï¿½Most of the temples in Tamil Nadu do not have the names of  

the kings. But one of the temples in Thiruvottiyur, which is in the  
shape of a gajapirushtam, has an inscription naming the builder of the  

temple as Veera Chola Ravi.ï¿½  

  
Another interesting point she noted was that the Vijayanagara Dynasty  
kings did not sign in their own names on the inscriptions. Whenever  
they signed on the metal inscriptions, they used the name of Sri  
Virupaksha, since the latter was the traditional deity of those  

kings.ï¿½  
  
ï¿½One can get a lot of information from these inscriptions. But people  

do not have a conscious sense of history and damage such inscriptions  
by abandoning them or pasting posters on them. This must be  

prevented,ï¿½ she concluded.

It was not only the language of the kings but of all educated people,  
just as English is the link language today. Shankara from Kerala,  
moved round the whole country, having discussions with contemporary  
scholars. Scholars from south went to Varanasi and such places and  
those from north came to Kanchi etc.

traditions in Tamil Nadu is expressed in a public domain. Kudos to

and Tamil heritage & culture. Keep it up.

Language and Lipi both are different. People normally confuse between  
the two. Prehistoric days Sanskrit was written in poorva brahmi, later  
in Brahmi Lipi in south India in Grantha lipi later in North India  
Devanagari lipi. Temple inscriptions in south in both old Tamil and  
Sanskrit were in Grantha lipi. Till 1930s Grantha lipi was widely used  
for writing Tamil. Just like Chinese lost touch with old script and  
moved to phutongua due to Govt. Intervention to increase literacy!? We  
also lost touch with our old script
