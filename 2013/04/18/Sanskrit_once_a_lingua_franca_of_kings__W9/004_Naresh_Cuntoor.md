I don't know how one can agree with Murthyji's point and the points made in Deshpande's article at the same time.  

  
I have read the part of Deshpande's article that's available on google books (2 pages are not available). He has taken the so-called conservative view of diglossia in this case, which is to say that the language used in Patanjali's time was increasingly degenerate forms of Sanskrit. Such a situation is hardly unfamiliar to us today. The English spoken in living rooms of some parts of Louisiana is hardly the same as that spoken in waspy Connecticut. (I'm not even going across the pond to illustrate the point, nor am I using native vs. non-native speakers here).  
  

Patanjali makes a strong case for speaking the correct language (as he sees it), as does the subhashita-kaara who quotes the example ' shakRut sakRut mA bhUt'. Their insistence has to be seen from their perspective as grammarians or as people who are similarly interested in language's 'correctness'.  
  

Clearly Patanjali was reacting to the increasingly corrupt language usage when he makes the point gauH becoming gavi etc. But doesn't that mean that he recognizes that the situation was better previously from his point of view? Or, if indeed degenerate usage was always the norm, then why would Patanjali rail against it?  
  

And then there are examples in his very commentary which point to everyday examples to illustrate grammatical points. Had Sanskrit been used exclusively in literary circles, wouldn't one expect him to quote usages of kavis to make whatever grammatical points he wants to make?  
  

Further, if Sanskrit had indeed been limited in utility to religious / Vedic purposes, pratishakhyas would have served the purpose as far as grammar was concerned. Why would a series of grammarians try to reconcile language usages that span a wide spatio-temporal range?  

  

As far as script is concerned, sure, we know that scripts have evolved over time. So how does that matter? Nobody is saying Devanagari was always used as the script for Sanskrit. In fact even today, that is not the case.
