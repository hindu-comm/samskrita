Vimalaji has already answered on the point. In all these matters, we have only beliefs and nothing can be conclusively proved.

1\. Much of Buddha's teachings and Buddhistic scripture is only in Pali. Not Sanskrit.

2\. The fact that in Sanskrit plays common people speak only Prakrut cannot be explained otherwise.
