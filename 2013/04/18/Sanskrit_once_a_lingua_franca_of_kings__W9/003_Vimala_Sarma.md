I also agree with Murthyji

See Despande, Madhav, 1991 page 36.

"Conceptions of Diglossia in the Writings of Sanskrit Grammarians" Southwest Journal of Linguistics. The Journal of the Linguistic Association of the Southwest 10.1:23-40.

According to Despande, Sanskrit had become very much "removed from the linguistic behaviour of the masses" and was "restricted to a highly contextualised domain". As early as in Patanjali's the spoken use of Sanskrit was restricted to the sacrificial context. Even the elite spoke a form of Aprabhramśa or Prakrit at home.



As you know the grammar and pronunciation of Sanskrit was not easy for fast speaking and Prakrits simplified both. In Pāniṇī's time the vernacular language of Taxila was Gāndharī and its script was Karoṣṭhī (not Brahmi). Devanagari script had not yet evolved. The Buddhists schools of that time wrote their manuscripts in Gāndharī using this script. The Buddhist instructed that the vernacular languages should be used for propagating Buddhism. Sanskrit was a learned language by an small educated class (śiṣṭa) who used it among themselves to compose
verses in social gatherings and for performances etc. These were artificial situations and not normal conversation.



There is a parallel situation in Tamil - where there is a "high Tamil" of the Sangam literature which almost nobody speaks and an everyday vernacular Tamil for conversation.
