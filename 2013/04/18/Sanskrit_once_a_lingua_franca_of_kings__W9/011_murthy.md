A propos Sai susarlaji's comment, all that I can say is वादे वादे जायते तत्त्वबोधः.

As to the furure of Sanskrit, I have no doubts that it has a greater chance of survival than what other Indian languages, excepting Hindi, have. There may be more than 20 full-fledged Sanskrit universities in India. Universities exclusively meant for any other Indian language would be one or two, again excluding Hindi.

Future of Sanskrit as a vibrant living language will essentially depend on expansion ofits vocabulary to encompass modern living, creation of new genres of literature and forward-looking attitude in contrast to wallowing in its glorious past.
