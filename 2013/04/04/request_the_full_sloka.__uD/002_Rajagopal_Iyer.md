namo namaH,  
  

It is indeed invigorating to know shrii. peekayaar and shrii Sunder Hattangadi are in this list  
  

I intend to restart transliterating taittiriiya sa.mhitaa in ITRANS further.  
  

Hope I will get help in proof reading it.  
  

I wish members will contribute with suggestions for transliteration format as it will be in pure text (ASCII).  

  

Regards,
