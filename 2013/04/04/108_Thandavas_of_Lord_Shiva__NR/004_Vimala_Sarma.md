Dear Parvathy

Do you mean the 108 karanas of dance? These can be seen in Chidambaram temple.



In the Kuchipudi dance tradition there are only three types of tandava, but there are many songs composed for these both for dance and singing.
The dance songs have a lot of nritta syllables for pure dance.

These are roudra tandava, ananda tandava and lasya tandava.



One story goes that Shiva does the roudra tandava when his wife immolates herself in the yagna fire when her father Daksha refuses to invite Shiva to his yagna because of his unconventional appearance and behaviour. From his furious dance the warrior virabadra is created who destroys daksha. Shiva is said to be angry and in sorrow of many thousands of years while he carries his dead wife.



The ananda tandava is a joyful dance which Shiva does in heaven. Vishnu plays mridangam, Saraswathi the veena, Indra plays the flute, Brahma keeps the talam, the apsaras watch in amazement, etc.



Lasya tandava is a dance done with Parvathy - in the feminine as well as masculine style - this suitable for ardhanareeshwara form or a duet with Parvathy in sringara mood.



Another story goes that there is a dance competition between Parvathy and Shiva in Chidambaram and Parvathy matches him step for step. Finally Shiva does the natarajasana (yoga) pose - ie raises his leg vertically.
Modesty prevents Parvathy from doing the same so Shiva wins the contest. Unfortunately I have not yet seen this choreographed.



Hope this helps

Vimala
