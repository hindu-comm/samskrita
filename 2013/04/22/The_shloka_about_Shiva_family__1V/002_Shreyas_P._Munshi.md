Subject: \[Samskrita\] The shloka about Shiva family  
  
Some time ago, a scholar had posted a shloka which  
talked about harmony in Lord Shiva's family despite their vehicles being natural foes: Kartik's peacock/shiva's snake/ganesh's mouse/shiva's nandi and Parvati's lion..  
  
  
  
Would the scholar repeat the shloka and oblige?
