तत्र प्रथमपत्रे एवम् सूचितम् - "welcome to the first edition of Sadāsvāda, an attempt at exploring the perennial pleasures of Sanskrit literature. We hope to look at one beautiful Sanskrit phrase every edition, with a morsel of information about its origin and context. While the futility of trying to drink an ocean by sampling drops here and there is not lost on us, we take some solace in the success of predecessors in this path, from Proust to Penzias."
