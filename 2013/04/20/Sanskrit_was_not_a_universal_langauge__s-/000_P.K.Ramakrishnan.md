Sanskritam was the language of the educated while for others it was

Prakritam of different hues. In the classical age the language used

in dramas was Sanskrit for males and Prakrit for females and lower

uneducated males. Even in Valmiki's time Sanskrit was spoken only

by the educated males. Here is a verse from Valmiki Ramayana

Sundara Kanda Sarga 30 sloka 18 -

  

yadi vaacham pradaasyaami dvijaatiriva samskritam /

raavanam manyamaanaa maam sitaa bhitaa bhavishyati //

  

Here it is given that only dvijaatis speak in Sanskrit. Brahmins,

Khatriyas and Sudras are indicated. That also only males since females

do not undergo the sacred thread ceremony after which they enter the

gurukulam for studies.
