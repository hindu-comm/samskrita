The Dramas of great composers and published now need not be in their original form. For example, in one of the publications, I noticed in the introduction that the prakruta dialogues are based on what Panickars Drama Troupe was using for their stage shows about two hundred years ago. Further, it appears that some of the dramatis personae speaking in Sanskrit and the others in Prakrit was a convention of the dramatists.
