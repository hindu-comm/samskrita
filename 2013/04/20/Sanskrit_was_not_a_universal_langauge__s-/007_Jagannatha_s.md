Additional points

1\. Some authors,who are well known in Samskrta composed even in Samskrtetara languages like Vedantadeshika(Samskrta and Tamilu). His Accu-a-sa-a-a(Achyuta-Shataka) is in Praakrta.

2.Some authors, who are well known in Samskrtetara, composed Samskrta works like Vidyapati(Maithili and Samskrta) and Shadakshari(Kannada and Samskrta)

3\. Translations from Samskrta to Samskrtetara andvice vercais age-old practice.

4\. So many inscriptions are bilingual.(Samskrta plus Samskrtetara).

**Conclusion:**

It is not correct to consider only some dramas of Samskrta while determining the percentage in usage of languages among the masses / elite in ancient India.

S.Jagannatha.
