These points may be pondered :

  

1.Can we have example of any society in which all the women speak a language which is different from that of men?

  

2\. Only dramas show such difference. But why not Mahakavyas, Gadyakavyas? For example in Bana's Kadambari or Raghuvamsha of Kalidasa, one can not see such difference. But Kalidasaemploys Praakrta for female roles in his Dramas! Does it mean that only Kalidasa's dramas reflect the society of his days (regarding language ) and his Mahakavyas and Khandakavyas give false testimony ?

  

3.Noforeigntraveler had said that our country had different dialects between men and women.

  

4.No Dharmashastra work says that women should talk a language different from that of men.

  

5.In Pancha-raatra there is a dialogue between Virata and Brhannalaa
\`\`Uurgitam karma, Samskrtam Abhidhiiyataam.''. (Viraata did not know that Brhannalaa was Arjuna who belonged to Kshatriya race of ELITE).

  

6.There are some praakrta dramas like Karpuramanjari in which even
Kshatriyas like the King speak in Praakrta.

  

7.Vidushaka is Brahmana(elite) in the dramas who speaks in Praakrta.

  

8.In Malatimadhava, both Sutradhara and Nata speak in Samskrta. When they start to assume roles of Kamandaki and Avalokitaa, Avalokitaa(Nata) speaks in Prakrta.

  

9.Children like Sarvadamana in Abhijnanashakuntala and son of Chandanadaasa speak in Praakrta. Does it mean that, in the classical age, children spoke Prakrta and when they became adults they started to use Samskrta completely forgetting Prakrta all of a sudden?

  

10.Some times we read Samskrtam Aashritya and Praakrtam Aashritya in dramas. What do they suggest ?

  

11.Can we argue that the jackals, elephants, rabbits, tigers and even birds were talking in Samskrta by quoting conversations of Panchatantra/ Hitopadesha ? (Interestingly, female-animals talk in Samskrta in both story collections.) 

  

12\. In Samskrta also one can commit grammatical blunders. The style free from grammatical blunders is meant by the expression of Samskrtaam vaacham in ValmikiRamayana. Otherwise we have to assume that the language of Valmikiramayana, available in the present form is Praakrta. After thinking like \`\`Yadi vaacham'' etc... Hanuman starts to speak in a language which is known as Samskrta and not Prakrta. The verse Naanrgveda viniitasya... gives definite proof of existence of two layers in Samskrta speaking. First was grammatical. Second was of common
folks, of course, with some sub-layers.

  

13.In both Mahabharata and Ramayana all men and women and even the
\`\`non-elite'' speak in Samskrta. But in the dramas based on these works, women speak Praakrta. Shall we argue that all of a sudden in the Post-ramayana or Post-mahabharata period, women developed hatred towards Samskrta?. Now the question is who advised them to dislike
Samskrta and why ?

  

14.Only Natyashastra makes injunction for code of languages IN DRAMA PRESENTATION which does not record daily usage of different dialects among different people. **Does it not mean that the
languagedifferences seen in the dramas was purely of Dramatic convention?**  

  

15\. Why did Brahmins create vast literature in even Samskrtetara Languages like Kannada ?

  

16.Why did kings make Samskrta inscriptions in which the main topic is granting of lands ? Theinterestingthing is usually these inscriptions contain curse statements at the end. These curse statements aim towards the landthieves. Who were these landthieves? Were they elites?

17\. The style is tough in some Mahakavyas. Even in Kannada, classical kavyas like Gadayuddha and Vikramarjuna-vijaya can not be grasped by common folks. Reading these Kavyas require some education.Can we say that Kannada was not a language of masses ? (This point may be
considered seriously while pondering over tough style of Samskrta inscriptions. Thousands of Kannada inscriptions are in tough style)

18\. Why did Samskrtists compose Samskrtetara grammars in Samskrta? (Like, prakrta-vyakarana-sutra). Does it show that Samskrta was not a language of masses ? Severalforeign scholars have written Samskrta grammars and Samskrtetara Bharatiiya-bhaashaa grammars in their own languages like English. Does it prove that English is not a language of masses?

19.If Samskrta was not a language of masses why the works on Gajayurveda and Ashvayurveda were composed in Samskrta ? Who were and are keeping elephants ? The elite ones ?

20\. Why did our forefathers compose Subhaashitas in Samskrta ? Every body knows that the Subhashitas are literary documentations of our life in succinct manner.

21\. While reading Mahabharata or Ramayana can we haveslightest doubt as \`\` this diction is not influenced by life, but only from prakrta language''.

22.Why one can trace so many proverbial statements like bhakshite'pi lashune na shaanto vyaadhih in Samskrta literature ?

23\. If Samskrta was not a language of masses why does it have plethora of various pada-forms ? Does not it mean that the Samskrta grammarians recorded even subtle details of various usages/pronunciations by making field work ?Every language has its own exceptional structures. Samskrta has set a record in exceptions. If a grammarian creates a language, he makes uniformity in every word-usage. Exception-less language is only one in the whole world and that is Esperanto. This language is artificially created. But in the spoken languages, exceptions are very common and sometimes they are the real energetic pulses.

  

24\. Buddha's refusal of permitting of Samskrta translation of his teaching does not disprove spoken status of Samskrta. He might have feared that his views may be deteriorated in translation.

25.Every body knows that the mother tongue of Buddha was not Samskrta. But does it mean that, in his time, Samskrta was not existed ANYWHERE in our country? Does not the demand to translate his discourse in to Samskrta itself prove existence of Samskrta to some extent even in
his region ?

26\. Kannada classical works did not born in North Gujarath, Oria classical works did not take birth in Kerala. Malayalam works were not
produced in Bengal, so on and so forth. But, Samskrta works were produced in every nook and corner of our country. Why it was so?

27\. Spoken status of Samskrta is unquestionable. Does not various Sandhis prove the same?
