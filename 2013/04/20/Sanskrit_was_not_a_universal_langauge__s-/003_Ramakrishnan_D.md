If Brahmanas, kshatriyas and sudras were the knowers of Samskrit in those olden days, is it not sufficient to say that people of the country were knowledgeable to have their daily routines exchanged with each other.

That indicates that the popular language for the populace was Samskrit.

Even today , how many are capable of conversing in English except a few who are well educated.  For that matter, even in local languages, much of the populace can't read or write, except speaking in the local language with a lot of grammatical errors.

It is suffice to say that the medium of exchanging of ideas in olden days was

Samskrit or Prakrit/Pali for literate or illiterate people respectively.
Prakrit/Pali is derivative of Samskrit only.  Regards,

D.Ramakrishnan.
