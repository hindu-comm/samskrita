"roti", the staple food of much of India…



Regarding point 5. Roti made as it is to-day with wheat (with to-days logistics of transport of wheat from a distance, retailing, wholesaling systems, etc) is the staple nowadays but what evidence is there that it was "staple" in ancient times? Bread from the central Asia is made differently from roti and can be stored for a long time. They could have eaten this kind of bread. They used to eat cakes made from other cereals - rice, barley, etc or other grains grown in villages nearby where people could harvest by hand. There was a former thread on "roti" on this forum. The Indian diet has changed much over this long period of time. Chillis, tomatoes, potatoes and all the things we like are comparatively recent.
