As we can see from the oldest manuscripts Sanskrit drama-s, they are accompanied with different (six types categorically) of Prakrit languages, as laid down in the Natyashastra of Bharata and later texts on dramaturgy. Whether this is naturally reflects the contemporary society of the dramatist or the theme is a different question, raised from the modern view of Literary criticism which holds the literature should reflect the contemporary state of the society as can be seen in modern classical Literature of the West and contemporary post British period Indian critics of Indian Literature.

This convention has been discussed in detail in the following thread:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/vu0aX-lzwAw/CWa-KE2l18gJ>  

  

raised by Sankar with reference to rendering of Sanskrit Plays into Malayalam and other languages.

Not necessarily. But it is the convention of Natyashastra, which lays down the rules following what he has found in the dramas prior to him or at least he sampled for his analysis of drama-s/ Here the convention is specifically presented in reply to Sankara's query on Sita's language:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/kvCdhb9uW3Q/FjQQAR9hXg4J>  

  

  

We may consider Sita as goddess, but it may be Maithili. but what is presented in Uttaramaramacarita would be either shauraseni or other variety of languages prescribed in Natyashastra.

Not all Kavya's, but only Drama's only have this convention, not only of Kalidassa, but all the later dramatists. And not any other poetry of Kalidasa or later poets. But Kavya-s like shastra tradtition, employ mixure of other languages with Sanskrit as scholastic feat, while Prakrit has its own Kavya Literature, like Setubandha, etc. irrespective of its employment or dialogues by the characters speaking the languages. There are types of sattaka, which employes Prakrit only for the variety of drama..

But he doesn't mention about the characters presented in drama-s at his time nor had any reference to plays in Sanbskrit?

Women or particular guild men can speak different kinds of prakrit, as characterised by the nIcapaatra0s and uttama0 paatra in could employ in cases of privacy, speak a different language than sanskrit, i.e. prakrit also theoretically possible for real life or dramatic representation.

It is Natyashastra, that speaks of difference of language used in dialogues in the different languages/dialects of Prakrit and not Dharmashastra or Smriti. Why should we draw such ambiguity into the dramatical convention?

I can;t make the meaning of this dialogue. It follows the presentation of drama, natya, itself as Brihannala was supposed to teach uttara, dance. So Intereference of Virata can be justified in the matter of Natyashastra and need not mean it was the language used by Brihannala, as the teacher.

This is already explained in the sattaka type, where Prakrita is to be employed. More can be change of languages could be observed from the Natyashastra, Bhashavidhana. which deals with the employment of languages for the dialogues in dramatic presentations.

The bhashavidhana chapter in Natyashastra answers the above questions.

Now it is the imagination of the theme, that plays importance in the stories meant for Children and not the caste or creed, but the media of narration itself decides the language of the characters.

It is not samskrita, as the name of language, but could be meaning only refined speech. Refined by their cultured, as contrast naanrigvinitasya etc. make it clear. This point has been discussed many times earlier, quoting the same line, but it is not conclusively pointing out that samskritam was the name of the language spoken at that time or at least in the line quoted/

You may direct this question towards Bharata, and his predecessors, who laid down the bhashavidhana for Natya presentation, in Dasarupaka-s and not towards the poets like Vyasa or Valmiki or the society which entertained the plays.

This has already been replied by Bharata as he is dealing with Bashavidhana in Natyashastra exclusively meant for the dramatic presentation.

The society demanded such literature and there is no ban on creative talent in any language. And could not be laid down by any Dharmashastra.

The same reply as the above. The kings rules for the people and the society demanded the employment of the languages in Public edicts. Ashokans Pali inscriptions are also available. In maintaining law and order, it is needed. encroachment of lands and their boundaries donated or dedicated for charitable purposes are inscribed in the languages of the people or the ruling administration.

The same as kind linguist question, change of language in chronological order and the contemporary needs of the readers. The poets are divided by critics differently and poems also differently \\following the standards of the society, they are appreciated and also the intellectual gradation. Vaidarbhi, Pancali, Gaudi, etc. riti, Madhurya, ojas prasada etc. the qualities of the poems.

English was introduced by British Imperial rulers and not acquired as a
natural exchanges of regional languages, Kannada, Malayalam, etc. It may be Sanskrit was lingua franca of the elite classified rulers as suggested by many which the ruled had to adopt like English, has Indian writers and poets of renowned ones.. And so on. PrakritiH eva prAkritam, and tataH samskritam is a definition by some Prakrit grammarians and the historical linguists. As Indian languages are not uniformly spread in India, still divided per languages, one common media was the need of the day to rule the people of different languages and communication to maintain law and order in a language which should be understandable by all regional language speakers from a practical point of view..

The physicians could be patients and all the patients could not be physicians. The language of instruction decides the language. Elephants need not know the Samkrit and nor theier keepers, like the doctor knows the medical language in which english is used and not the patient nor his care takers need not know even the English Language of getting advantage of medicine prescribed by the doctors.

The next question would be is it because they didn;t know any other language. This makes the language of the elite or the rulers and the common people or the ruled. They are documents of wise sayings and the documentation is avaialable in Sanskrit only.Either other languages have not developed the writing system even though their users were not either less wise or idiots or could more possiblye wiser than Sanskrit document writers.

If there was other language and what were the other languages at the time of the composition of Ramayana, by Valmiki, should be the first question. And whether the writer/reporter was contemporary with the episode he reports or a later reporter, as Narada reported to Valmiki, and Valmiki to his readers and then passed to us in time in Sanskrit Language" So the contemporary state of affairs are to be taken only reflected in the case of the live report and not in the later renderings of the reports from time to time. And the relationship of languages could be established only after establishing the contemporariness of languages or reporters or the episodes each other.

This is only natural to any language that proverbs exist in the language and not only specific to any language. But only the question is of available records in any languages,

From the grammarians, we get the reply, that no body goes to the grammarian and ask him to create words for our use like people go to the potter and ask him to make pottery works for their use. But only the grammarian's work is to analyze the language he samples, from the language already in use whether a single word, or words, or analysis of sentence, phrase for the purpose of grammatical analysis.

I don't know anybody whose mother tongue is Samskrita. Not only Buddha.Last enumeration may have many recordings of Samskrita as mother tongue.

Because simply they knew Sankrita and like Ravindra, Sarojini Naidu, whose mothers might not have taught English became English Poets..

It can happen like Indian English, a category. Now all of your questions have been analized. This may prove that Sanskrit was spoken by many people, like English.



And by the way, the issue raised in the quotation is also referred to in earlier posts.
