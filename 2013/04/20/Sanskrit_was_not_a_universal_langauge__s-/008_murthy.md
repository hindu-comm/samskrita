Regarding points made out by Jagannathaji

1\. The norm in Sanskrit plays that the non-elite and women speak in prakrit may not be totally in conformity with the prevalent reality in the days when Sanskrit plays were actually being enacted. It could have been stylized; but could not have been totally at variance with the reality.

2\. All said and done, poetic compositions are known to be fartherfrom reality than plays and therefore they do not employ a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit. There are great works in Prakrit just as in Sanskrit.

3\. Sanskrit was a common medium of communication among the elite through out Bharatavarsha,just as English is today. But it was not spoken by the hoi polloi. That is all.

4\. The fact that Sanskrit poets have composed works in Prakrit/local language or Scholars of local language have created Sanskrit works does not appear to have any bearing on this subject.

5.Does it not appear strange, to say the least, that a language which does not have a suitable word to denote "roti", the staple food of much of India, isconsidered as the language that common people spoke once upon a time ?

Murthy
