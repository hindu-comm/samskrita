I agree Vimalaji. For whatever period we have been consuming "roti"s we have not cared to have a disinctword-to the extent thatthe discussions that took place in this forum in another thread revealed-for that in Sanskrit. Is it not a pity that those who immersed themselves in Sanskrit did not have any reason to refer to "roti" anywhere in the vastness ofSanskrit writingsthey created?
