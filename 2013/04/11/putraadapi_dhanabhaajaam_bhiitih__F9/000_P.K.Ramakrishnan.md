Deepak Bhardwaj a wealthy farmhouse

owner in Delhi was mudered recently. His son

Nitish Bharadwaj has been taken into custody

on suspicion of murdering his father.

  

Now I remember the following sloka of Sankaracharya:

  

अर्थमनर्थं भावय नित्यं

नास्ति तत: सुखलेशस्सत्यं /

पुत्रादपि धनभाजां भीति:

सर्वत्रैषा विहिता रीतिः //

  

Wealthy persons are afraid of their own sons-

that is the way everywhere.
