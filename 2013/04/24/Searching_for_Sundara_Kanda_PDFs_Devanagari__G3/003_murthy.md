The version of Ramayana text followed by Govindaraja and Maheswaratirtha in their commentaries significantly differs from the text printed by Gita Press.I have found that Gitapress version has several errors, which do not occur in the text published by Laxmivenkateswara Press, Kalyan along with the above referred commentaries. Has there been any effort in correcting the Gita Press version? Only some of the errorscould be said to be typos.

Regards

Murthy
