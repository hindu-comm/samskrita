dhanyaavaadaH Shri Sundar mahodaya,

  

Both of the versions are closer to the gItA press edition. Thanks to the Baroda Critical edition as well. One of the the sanskrit-docs link takes us to the [valmikiramayan.net](http://valmikiramayan.net) by (Late) Shri Desiraju Hanumantarao Garu. If my understanding is correct, it is one of the south Indian renditions (paaTha).

dhanyavaadaH Shri Shankara-ji. Thanks for the link. This too is different from the gItA-press edition, but a more critical comparison is needed.

namaste Shri Murty-ji,

  

Could you please provide some instances of errors from Gita-press book? Also, please point us to some typos as well. I am asking this because many bhakta-s as well as scholars consider this edition to be the quite "standard edition", and I believe this edition is the same as the Nirnaya Sagar edition.

  

dhanyavaadaH

Ramakrishna
