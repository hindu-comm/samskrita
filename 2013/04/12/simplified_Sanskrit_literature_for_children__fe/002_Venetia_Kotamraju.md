There was a seminar on Sanskrit for children just a few days ago:<http://sanskritaprasruti.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/a-national-seminar-on-sanskrit-for-children-at-puduchcherry-13-14-april-2013/>

  

I wonder if anybody attended it and has comments to pass on?

  

A friend and I also felt there weren't enough high quality children's books in Sanskrit and we are trying to translate some of the more popular Pratham Books into Sanskrit - Pratham Books licences some of their books under Creative Commons and are very open to people translating them into other languages:<http://prathambooks.org/>.
