This has always been the foremost question on my mind.  
  
Though, the efforts of many people to revive Sanskrit are laudable - why  
is there an utter dearth of simple literature for children in the form  
of short stories, etc.  
  
Surely, our scholars in Sanskrit must have thought of this by now.  
  
Yes, there is Chandamama, but the level is a bit higher than complete  
beginning.  
And it is not enough.  
  
If I read 500 books by Enid Blyton in English when I was in school, why  
cant I expect the same in Sanskrit.  
  
I am aware very few such stories exist, but I am comparing 50 such tales  
with 500 or 1000 or more.  
  
Or is it that Sanskrit doesnt lend itself to the style of fiction or  
prose that is the norm today ? (I am of course a beginner, so such  
questions come to my mind)  
  
Why should I mug up grammar, word endings, and word lists ?  
Wouldn't it be nicer to learn all this in the context of stories ?  
Why should I jump directly, and struggle with appreciating fine poetry  
or philosophical subhashitas or etc ?  
  
It's my personal opinion that this vacuum needs to be filled, at the  
very least, for children, if not for other age groups too.  
  
I hope to hear some answers.
