Namaste,

  

I was delighted to see link for kids - point raised by vishal is very valid.

Now my grief (until my ignorance is removed) is the link is to US Samskrita Bharati,

cost is in $$s.

Me, typical trend abiding, left US a few yrs back and have made Bharata Home.

  

Can someone please remove my ignorance and give me link to Indian book store.

I am getting my 6 yr old started on Samskritam , and hence need help from

scholars. Me myself a beginner in Samskritam, so desperate for such books

which will encourage more early and very early reading.

  

Regards,

Sunil
