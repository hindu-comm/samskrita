namaste,

  

If we look back, we see extended families and a culture of story-telling. This is "devii-vaak" ... the women of the family, who often couldn't read or write, would none the less regale the children of the family. Just the Ramayana and Mahabharata alone provide enough material for an entire childhood. These stories are timeless. By virtue of being Rishi-vachanam, they have a special shakti within them. For parents, it should be possible to use the panchatantra (excluding subhashitas), ramayana and mahabharata as the basis of a childhood syllabus. ie. it starts with children listening, and slowly moves towards their active reading. If the parents have a basic amount of Sanskrit fluency, they can make do with this.

  

  

As far as simple prose literature goes, this is a very laudable goal. Samskrita Bharati has been publishing the Sambhasha Sandesha magazine for many, many years. All of this is modern prose. They have certainly published more than 1000 simple short stories for children and young adults. I suspect that the real number is much higher. Certainly more than enough material to bridge the gap to the panchatantra and ramayana.

  

  

It would certainly be nice if the vacuum you perceive in Sanskrit literature can be filled. But, this does not require scholars. Stories for children are not written by English scholars ... but by normal people. So, learn Sanskrit the current way, pick up your pen, and make it easier for those who follow you :-)

  

sasneham,
