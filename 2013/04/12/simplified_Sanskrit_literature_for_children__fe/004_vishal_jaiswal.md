First of all, thank you very much to all of you who have replied in this  
thread.  
  
Let me clarify that when I said vacuum, I was thinking of the area  
between absolute beginner and the Chandamama stories.  
  
Perhaps, something similar to graded texts with deliberately simplified  
stories with minimal set of grammatical concepts at each of these levels  
would be good.  
  
As some of you might know, Tulika books also publish story books which  
fill the above-mentioned gap in several Indian languages. I emailed them  
quite some time back asking why dont they come out with parallel books  
for Sanskrit. They were just silent, & I presume that they wouldnt make  
any money out of that ?  
  
Anyway Tulika books are really expensive (I suppose, its justified by  
the elaborate graphics in their books), but Pratham books are doing a  
great job with modestly priced books. So I look forward to Venetia's  
project seeing the light of day. I have not actually read Pratham's  
books yet, but I hope that some of the books will fill this crucial  
first gap that I keep referring to.  
  
I also saw the pdf file for the seminar on Sanskrit for children.  
And again, it seemed very vague and generic.  
All the talks seem to refer to many poems, plays, stories, songs,  
rhymes, picture-cards, games, etc which have yet to exist outside the  
talks. The only concrete reference was to the graded Sanskrit primers  
published by Samskritbharati, Chennai.  
  
Let's hope someone will eventually bell the cat, instead of just talking  
about various ways.  
By the bell, I refer to actual beginner's literature targeting the 5-8  
year age group !  
  
And it is implicit that when I reach a decent level in Sanskrit, it  
would be my duty to write  
original stories !  
  
As a side note, I am equally sad to see most of the Indian regional  
languages slowly fading into a strange mixture with english, to simply  
exist at the day-to-day functional usage.  
  
I day dream sometimes about a rich ecosystem that could possibly  
flourish with more than two dozen major Indian languages interacting  
among themselves via translations.  
If only we were a nation of readers as the Soviet Union was !  
Apologies for the tiny digression.
