Dear Friends

I wonder if I could have a list of reputable quality Indian Journals who might be interested in publishing papers on philosophy. I have written an exegesis of valli three of Kathopanisad which has some original thoughts and would like to see this published somewhere.

Please advise

Thank you

Vimala
