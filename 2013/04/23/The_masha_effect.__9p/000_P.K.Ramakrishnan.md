There are five well known mahakavyas in Sanskrit. These are
Raghuvamsa and Kumarasambhava of Kalidasa, Sisupalavadha of Maagha, Kiratarjuniya of Bharavi

and Naishadhiyacharitam (Naishadham) of Sriharsha. Of these the last one is very

difficult to understand. There is a saying Naishadham Vidvadaushadham.



Sriharsa had revised this many times to make it understandable. Once one of his friendswent to him and asked:



Harsha! Kim chikeershasi? – What would you like to have? हर्ष! किं चिकीर्षसि?



Harsha replied – semushiimushi maashamushe. शेमुषीमुषि माषमुषे

I would like to eat udud or black gram which will rob off my intellect.
