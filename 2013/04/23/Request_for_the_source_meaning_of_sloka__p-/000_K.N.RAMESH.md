Dear learned members,  
  
I'm looking for the source & meaning of the following sloka on Sukra:  
  
sukrantE anyath jagatantE anyath vishuroope ahani  
dyouribaasi visvaahi maaya avasisva dhaavah  
bhadraatE bhoosan iharaathirasthu  
  
since this was learnt by hearing, there could be lot of mistakes .  
Please correct them.
