There is also the butterfly asana which is I think called the titali asana but I am not sure what Sanskrit word 'titali' corresponds to.
That an asana is named after a butterfly might argue for the fact that there were butterflies but such asanas are themselves controversial and perhaps this particular one is a modern invention.
