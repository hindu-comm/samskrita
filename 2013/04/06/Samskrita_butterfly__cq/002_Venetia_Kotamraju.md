I have always wondered whether there were in fact butterflies in ancient India - are they native to India? In kavya there is so much about many other fauna but I have not to my recollection ever seen any mention of a butterfly by whatever name. This is odd if you consider how easily butterflies might have fed poets' imaginations. It is the bee that holds the pride of place instead.
