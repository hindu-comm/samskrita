Yes I also saw that titila means a bat but not sure if that corresponds to the name of the asana.

  

Is there such a distinction between the bhramara and madhukara. In kavya at least they seem to me to be interchangeable - along with the many many other synonyms for bee (madhu-lih, shat-pada etc etc).
