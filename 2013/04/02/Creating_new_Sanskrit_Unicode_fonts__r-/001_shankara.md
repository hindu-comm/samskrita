Eddie,  
  
I should have been more careful while writing the query. In fact my friend doesn't need to create totally new fonts. He just needs to convert TTF fonts to Unicode. Anyway, I will forward your mail to him.  



regards  
shankara

Shankara,



 The magic word is ‘typography’.

Typography is a skill. Requiring natural aptitude - and knowledge – of both a technical and an artistic kind.



Does your friend know what a Zero Width Non-joiner (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner) is, for example?



Even if the idea is just to add an extra glyph or two to an existing Sanskrit font, such knowledge is a must.





He can Google for ‘Introduction to Typography’ or ‘Free Font Designers’ or whatever.



But if he has to ask . . .



Eddie
