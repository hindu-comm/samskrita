If I might suggest this option for finding a name for a baby girl, without having to deal with the M-W Sanskrit Dictionary, which is certainly showing its "age" by the second decade of the 21st Century, I would recommend that you first decide upon what you want to name the baby girl for in Sanskrit — be it a quality, after a Devi or some other suitable name. Then I would consult the *Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Based upon the St. Petersburg Lexicons,* edited**by Carl Cappeller, first published in 1891 and more recently published as a volume in the Cambridge \[University\] Library Collection Series in Linguistics in 2009. There are editions of this Sanskrit-English Dictionary available online and also available, as a searchable volume, on Amazon.com's web site, so that you can check the proper Devanagari spelling of the name(s) that you are considering or have selected, as well their semantic import (meaning(s)). Aside from the use of an older initial vowel character for "a" in the Cappeller Dictionary, for which you can substitute the modern Devanagari initial "a" character, this particular approach to finding a name for the baby girl in Sanskrit that is correctly spelled and that has a very accurate meaning, based upon the contextual uses of the Sanskrit word in texts, rather than a simple denotational meaning of the M-W Dictionary. Remember to use the Feminine form(s) for nouns in Sanskrit, since you are naming a baby girl. The Cappeller Sanskrit-English Dictionary is based upon the St. Petersburg Lexicons that is still considered one of the best dictionaries of Sanskrit (to German) ever published. The English translation of Capeller's Sanskrit Dictionary is also very accurate and contains about 50,000+ entries (with often several different forms of the same root word(s) included). You might also consult one of the many Apte Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, but I highly recommend starting your search in the Capeller Sanskrit-English first.

  

Best,
