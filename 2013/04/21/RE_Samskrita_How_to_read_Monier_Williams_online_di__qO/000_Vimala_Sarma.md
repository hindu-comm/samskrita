I am sorry to say that this forum decided some time ago that it will not be providing advice on baby names which can be obtained from a number of onłine sources such as;

<http://www.indianhindunames.com/indian-hindu-girl-name-s.htm>



Su is a prefix for good, well, and can be added on to other words (nouns, particles or adjectives) - so you have plenty of choice.



For help with MW:



Green font are original sources and the list is in the front of the dictionary/. <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/mwauthorities/mwauth_SktDevaUnicode.html#record_Ka1v_>;

**Subject:** \[Samskrita\] How to read Monier Williams online dictionary?



I am looking for Sanskrit girl baby names starting with "S" and consulting Monier Williams dictionary to be sure.  
Name list websites are highly unreliable - the one makes a blunder and a hundred others copy that wrong entry.  
  
In the process, I discovered that Monier Williams dictionary is very hard to understand for someone who is  
not already a linguist or a halfway Sanskrit scholar...  
  
For instance, I had many doubts:  
  
1) When an entry says mfn. does it mean it is an adjective that can be used for a male, female or neutral noun?  
  
2) When an entry has f. next to it, does it mean it is a female noun?  
  
3) Take the entry sAra (सार)  
*mf*(आ)*n.* hard , firm solid strong MBh. Ka1v. &c  
  
What does it mean to have आ next to f? Does it mean the word has to be said as sArA instead of sAra when used as an adjective for a female noun?  
  
4) I see the entry: **(H1B)सार2 \[L=242830\]** *mf*(आ)*n.* precious , valuable Das3.  
Does it mean that sAra was used to mean "precious, valuable" in the
source Dasakumara Charita (Das3)  
  
5) I never understand the words in green font. For example take this entry:  
  
**(H3)सु--रुचि \[p= [1232](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1232-suyavasu.jpg),2\] \[L=248722\]** *f.* great delight in (loc.) S3a1rn3gP. (v.l.)  
  
great delight in what? What is "loc"?  
And what is v.l?  
  
6) Many words that stand for girl names say "of an apsaras" What of an apsaras? (I know that an Apsara is a nymph, just not sure what the phrase means)  
For example, see entry:  
**(H3B)सु--रूप \[L=248735\]** *m.* of an अप्सरस् Hariv.   
  
7) I don't understand what (H1) (H1b) (h3b) etc stand for?  
  
Please help. The baby is due anytime now and I am still struggling!! **If not anything else, can a Sanskrit Scholar please confirm if SARA is a suitable Sanskrit name for a girl baby meaning "precious"?**  
  
Thanks  
Su Kris
