I have no comments if one finds it so easy the study of Grammar or the Text of Ashtadhyayi or Sanskrit Language. Linguistically from Gold Stucker up to SD Joshi have studied from different angles the text of Ashtadhyayi, Mahabhashya the renowned Great Commentary on it, and its commentaries innumerably increasing which shows the study of VyakaraNa Shastra is not so simple as one can see from some examples/models of simple sUtra-s. And Nagesha, the commentator on Mahabhashya, its sub commentary Pradipa by Kaiyata, is said to have studied 21 times the text of Mahabhashya commentary before he wrote his commentaries on them and also Siddhanta Kaumudi and its Commentary Praudhamanorama, which are considered as the basic texts for the beginners of Sanskrit VyakaraNa, namely Shabdendushekhara. The findings of Nagesha is considered as the final words on the study of Vyakarana, by the traditional scholars trained in VyakaraNa. And I am am glad that Vishvas Vasuki finds it so easy to master Sanskrit VyakaraNa, with Pushpaji's lessons.

  

For the information of Ramakrishnan, the informatin can be had from Pushpa Dikshit hereself, whose ID is herebelow:

The lessons are available online on some portions of Siddhantakaumudi, both in audio form and text of notes to the lessons to some extent.

And she is conducting classes on certain occasions at Chattisghar itself in the campus of Paniniya Shodha Pratishthan.

  

Mastering Language and mastering the Grammar of a Language (Linguistics) are two different things as well as learning a language.
