Namaskar to All,  
  
I am writing this one letter in English, to reach out to any on this  
list who may have started to think that Panini's grammer is too hard for  
them. Historically Panini's grammer has been taught to very few persons  
in the society; only a very select few could get access to this precious  
shastra. And the style of teaching was also such that only very few  
could understand. But Mother's approach is radically different. Her  
outlook as well as her technique of teaching, are inbuilt with the  
intent that this Panini grammer is for all.  
  
Let me give a case example. There is one young fellow from China, whose  
name is Cho. He finished his university studies in China and came to  
India around six months ago, wanting to learn Ashtadhyayii. He knew no  
Sanskrit. Having heard that Mother teaches Ashtadhyayii in a better way,  
he approached her with the wish to study under her. She welcomed him,  
and sent him first to Sanskrit Bharati's "Samvad Shala" Centre in Delhi  
for two weeks, to learn Abhyasa Pustakam. After two weeks at the Centre,  
he came to Mother's house-- and had been studying one-on-one with her  
for two months when the two of them arrived at the Gurukulam in Delhi in  
January where I had also come, for a one-month varga. Mother knows no  
English (i.e. very little, and cannot communicate in English). And Cho  
was knowing no Sanskrit. But she sat with him every day in her house for  
two months-- and is still doing so with him up to today itself-- amongst  
other things to show that this Panini grammer is for all. By the time he  
arrived at the Gurukulam he had already learned a tremendous amount,  
enough to be able to teach the students there quite a few things.  
  
By this example we can understand that even those not knowing Sanskrit  
can learn Panini's grammer without trouble. Mother's approach is that  
people who study Sanskrit should be given the actual Paniniiya grammer  
from the very beginning. And she teaches it in such a way that those  
without any knowledge or background in it, can easily understand. Now,  
this may not be apparent by looking at her dhAtupAtha pustakam-- because  
that book has been written with a view toward concision. But then the  
Ashtadhyayii has been written with the very same goal in mind:  
concision. It is only because of the concision that people think it is  
difficult to understand. Mother is the first to make available to the  
general people of the world, a method-- based indeed on Panini's own  
method-- by which a general person can easily access and master this  
precious shastra.  
  
....

  

that if anyone has a question, then they must ask and get their doubt  
cleared. All of you are wanting to master Sanskrit. Panini's method is  
clearcut and simple, and Mother has extracted that very method and  
presented it in a way that everyone can understand-- all the world can  
understand. Panini's grammer is the very nuts and bolts of Samskritam.  
Anyone who wants to know Samskritam well should know it, and can know  
it. So let us all move ahead together and master this most beautiful  
shastra, Panini's Ashtadhyayii.  
  
Regards,  
Swarup
