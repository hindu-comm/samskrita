Namaste

  

There are at least two versions of the Aryashatakam (one of the five shatakams that form Muka Kavi's Panchashati) and I am trying to establish which one is the most popular. The main discrepancy is based on the verse order of the first 20 odd verses. 

I have attached the two different versions (in terms of verse order) of the first 20 verses. 

If anyone is familiar with the work, from a scholarly or devotional point of view, I would be grateful if you could tell me which of these corresponds to the version you know.

Thank you

Venetia
