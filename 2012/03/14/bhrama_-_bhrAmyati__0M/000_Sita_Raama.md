Beginners book give dhatus like this भ्रम भ्राम्यति (a few are easy to memorize, after enough reading eventually one may know entire dhatupatha)

In the quote example, one can make out thatभ्रम is the verbal root andभ्राम्यति (It's Present tense)

  

Dhatupatha gives  भ्रमुँ चल॑ने (if I picked it correctly then). my question is do I need to go through Kaumudi sutras to find out how verbal root is transformed into example Present tense or is there a simple method to follow.

  

I would appreciate if themethodologyis described.
