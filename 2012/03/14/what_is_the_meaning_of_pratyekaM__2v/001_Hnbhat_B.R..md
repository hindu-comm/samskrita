Why don't you consider it as a Telugu word borrowed from Sanskrit with change in meaning, which is in common to other Indian languages even in those other than Telugu? So far as the language Telugu is concerned, it is the correct usage. Why to tally with Sanskrit? I don't think it is a nice way of learning a language.

  

ekam ekam prati - pratyekam - is an adverb used in Sanskrit language, and could not be used as such in any other language other than Sanskrit. It is a avyayIbhAva compound, which is formed according Paninian rules for compound formation which cannot govern Telugu language as such.

  

These are the meanings available for Sanskrit usage of the word:

  

pratyeka:

-   each one (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   each single one (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   every one (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

  

The above compound can be again compounded with any other word if necessity arises in other languages. Panini doesn't object to such usages as the usages are beyond the scope of his grammar.
