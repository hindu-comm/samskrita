Thanks a lot to Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat , Subrahmanian, and Nityananda Mishra for such clearcut and detailed explanation.  
  
I was blindly thinking that ' प्रत्येकम्\` means 'special' alonewhich in fact is itself a special case and the normal meaning of the word is 'every' or for each \[contextual\].  
  
And thanks to Dr. Bhat for enlightening me that the root words may get derivative meanings in other languages which many not be related to the actual meaning in the root language.
