In all the examples cited in Sanskrit above, it "eka" gives only "mukhya" or "kevala" as per the Amara lexicon cited by Sri Naresh, which can mean the single standing alone which itself gives the meaning outstanding in any group. And this doesn't need the compound प्रत्येक as a compound to get the meaning special as explained as "kevala".
