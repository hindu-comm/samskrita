With due respect to Monier Williams and other lexicographer scholars, the meaning of the word एक is not limited to 'one'. It can, depending on the context, mean 'THE only', 'special' or 'especially'.

अनायकैक नायकम् The only leader or the Special Leader, who is not led by anyone . .

लोकैक दीपांकुराम् - The only or special lamp lighting the entire world.

त्रिभुवनैकसुन्दरीम् - The only or special beauty in the entire three worlds.

In these contexts, if एक is taken as one, it connotes 'also ran'.

As an extension, प्रत्येकम् could be taken to mean especial, for a particular purpose \[ad hoc\] or a particular person. Not only in Andhra, it is used in this sense in Kerala, particularly in Palghat.

With reverence
