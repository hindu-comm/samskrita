Hi,  

> Having been a thelugu speaker, I was of the opinion that the > wordप्रत्येकं (sorry, did not have a transliterator for samskrutham > at hand) meant 'special'.  
>   
> However, today I came to know that it is used in Hindi/Marathi to mean > 'repeatedly', which makes sense since the word is a combination of > "प्रति" and "एकं".  
>   
> Now my question is if the other meaning which is extant in thelugu > about "special" is also one of the accepted meanings of this word or > are thelugu people using it in a wrong sense?  
> I'm asking this question out curiosity to know the correct usage and > correct myself.

Thanks and Regards,
