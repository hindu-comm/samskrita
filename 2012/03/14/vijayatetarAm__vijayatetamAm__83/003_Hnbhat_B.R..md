An additional note on the form with multiple suffix to get the final form. Three suffixes are there, the conjugation suffix normal for the verb plus two "taddhita" suffixes, तरप्, तमप् plus one more "tadhita" suffix forming the word finally an अव्यय as per the consideration under the rule : 1-1-38 तद्धितश्चासर्वविभक्तिः । which lists this suffix under the rule. आमु.

  

The "taddhita" suffixes are added to the conjugated forms of the verbs unlike other "taddhita" suffixes.
