महाभारतम्



Before reading Mahabharatam the following

sloka is recited.



नारायणं नमस्कृत्य नरं चैव नरोत्तमम् /

देवीं सरस्वतीं व्यासं ततो जयमुदीरयेत् //



Here I am referring to the word JAYAM.

Jayam means victory.

Here it refers to Mahabharatam.



According to KATAPAYADI system jaya

refers to 18. ja is 8 and ya is 1.

One has to read in the opposite direction.

So jaya refers to **18.**



Mahabharata consists of **18 **parvas.

Bhagavadgita which is part of Mahabharata consists of **18** chapters

Mahabharata war was fought among **18** akshouhinis -

(11 on Kaurava side and 7 on Pandava side).

It lasted **18** days.



Others may add if they know more.
