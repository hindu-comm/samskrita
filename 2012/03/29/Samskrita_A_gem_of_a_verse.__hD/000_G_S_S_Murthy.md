Dear all,  

While browsing through an old Kannada book on Sir M Viswewaraya, I came across this gem of a verse, which was reportedly quoted by Sir MV in one of his talks. Quite a few may already know. There would certainly be some like me who would not know.

“अधः पश्यसि किं बाले विनष्टं किन्नु मृग्यते ।“

“किन्न जानासि हे मूढ नष्टं तारुण्यमौक्तिकम् ॥“

The first part is the sarcastic question by a young man addressed to an old woman, walking with a bent-back. The second part is a sharp reply by the old woman. There is sarcasm, humour and profound thought.  
The verse is not listed in सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागारम्.  
Regards  
Murthy
