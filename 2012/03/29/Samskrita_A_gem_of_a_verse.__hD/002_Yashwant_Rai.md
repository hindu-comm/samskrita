Hi Mr.Murthy: Thanks for this beautiful verse. May I request most respectfully that I am one of those

still struggling with the early stage of learniing Sanskrit. If you give a fuller meaning line by line it becomes

much more meaningful andeasier to understand and learn.

  

With respectful regards,
