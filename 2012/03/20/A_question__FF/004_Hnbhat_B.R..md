On the whole, the verse doesn't sound well grammatically, just like the "mantra"s of "vaamaacaara" doesn't have to be binding with any grammar.

  

The word परिलिख्यति - is a rare conjugation form of the verb लिख - which would naturally take लिखति - or लिख्यते (in the passive voice). Here it seems to be if the combination of both the forms, परिलिख्यति in the active voice. यदि परिलिख्यति and the duplication of the words is just for the sake of being "mantra" live "jvala jvala jvaalaamaalinyai namaH" here हरिमर्कटमर्कट - all the three words mean only monkey, though the first "हरि" can be interpreted as belonging to Hari, The word मन्त्र being masculine, by its derivation, मर्कटमन्त्रमिदम् does not agree with the verb परिलिख्यति, (unless it is intended to be in passive, or the first मन्त्रमिदम् is used in the neuter gender accusative). In both ways is incomprehensible without giving up the grammatical structure. If the duplication, the grammar presupposes the recurrence of the verb or existence of a noun. If one written on the left palm, it is enough for the मन्त्र to have the effects listed in the two lines in the next half. The duplication is not is needed, in this case, but just for the sale of looking like a "mantra" like the ज्वालिनी- or ज्वालामालिनी mantra. Now, the the conditions for achieving the results mentioned is clear in the first half. If one writes on his left palm this "मर्कटमन्त्र", either the whole कवच in the preceding verses, or just "हरि-मर्कट-मर्कटा" as mantra (not sure of it), he the circle of enemies perishes off (frequently - or completely due to the repetition of the verb) and वाम-लता - the creeper binding him made by वाम-mantra-s (witchcraft or sorcery - called वामाचारप्रयोग० ) by others drops away completely. The worship of हनुमान् is recommended to thwart away any evils due to sorcery or witchcraft of वामाचार according to the traditional belief. Hence वाम-लता seems to be a correct metaphoric usage implying this much.
 

  

This much can be analysed from the verse irrespective of the incompatibility of grammatical structure.

  

In the above analyses, the splitting of वा मलता - मालिन्यम् is not correct as गुणवचन (attributes used as adjectives) only takes the suffix . अमलः - अमलता, may be correct, but it doesn't suit in this case. मल itself a noun and whether मल or मलता doesn't make much difference. मलिनस्य भावः - मालिन्यम् is a perfect formation.

  

And मलदा is a far possible emendation only used if required absolutely by context. मलं द्यति - मलदा derived from "दो अवखण्डने" but even with this context it is not fitting at all. मलदा वा मुञ्चति doesn't mean anything plainly speaking. It is an adjective and has some noun to be qualified by it which is totally absent.

  

The emendation, वामिल-ता can be justified. but this too far fetched one. The use of हनुमत्कवच- mantra to thwart away वामाचार is well known in the circles of mantra-shastra. Or अमलता - as बहुव्रीहि from अमल - न विद्यते मलं यस्मात् परम् - इति अमलम्, the most impurity, अमलता वा मुञ्चति - or the most of the impure sins drops off. In this case, the optional वा doesn't make much sense. Either the enemies circle is destroyed or the most strongest of the sins is dropped off. Either of these two may happen as a result of writing the कवच on one's वामतल (either as यन्त्र with कवच worn on the left side).
