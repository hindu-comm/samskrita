NityAnanda Mahodaya.

R K Panda " KumAra sambhava of kAlidAsa:' opines on pg 40 of his book that some parts of 7th canto shows clear influence of kAmasUtra, and other parts resemble shivapuraNa. However I do not want to start a controversy so I will not be commenting on any responses to this thread.

Sarasvati - both as the name of the river and as the personification of vAk - is mentioned several times in the Rigvedic brahmana - Aitareya.
