There is yet one more way to appreciate the import behind what  
Kalidasa has said. पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ are described as संपृक्तौ  
(similarly as) वागर्थौ इव. वागर्थौ is a union between the feminine  
and the masculine. For पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ to have a similar union that  
samaasa must be resolved as पार्वती च परमेश्वरश्च and not as  
पार्वतीपश्च रमेश्वरश्च.
