Vimala Ji

Thanks for the reference. Can you help with the publisher, ISBN, year,  
et cetera. Would be interesting to read this in detail, especially if  
the author points out verses that show influence of Kama Sutra or Shiv  
Purana in his opinion.

By itself, the influence of Kama Sutra or resemblance to Shiv Purana  
does not imply doubs in authorship of seventh canto. Vatsyayana and  
Kalidasa both are dated around the same time. If I remember correctly  
even Kale has pointed out similarities in the narrative of Kumara epic  
and Shiv Purana.

Essentially, I would be interested if Panda doubts authorship of  
seventh canto of Kumara building on these two observations.

Thanks, Nityanand
