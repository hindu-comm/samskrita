The disputed one is the Canto 8th and the remaining are not accepted as of Kalidasa by RV Krishnamacharya because of the language and as they are not commented by any commentator.

  

The amorous plays of Shiva and Parvati is in Canto VIII unless Panda is missing one Canto from the generally commented Text by commentators. And Narayana, in his Vivarana, argues against this view, and established Canto VIII is also by Kalidasa. This makes it clear the description according to Kamasutra, makes it doubtful in its ascription to Kalidasa and accepted as Kalidasa's by the commentators. This is the focus of the dispute.

  

I don't know why Panda has this description in Canto 7 while the others have it in 8. The above screen shot of V Krishnamacharya's history of Literature makes this clear.
