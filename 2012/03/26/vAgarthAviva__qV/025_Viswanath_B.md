I can't recall off my head the exact location, but a reference to saraswati exists in Taittiriya Samhita, 5th Kanda. I will confirm the location. I don't know though that it is the goddess saraswati, or the river.

  

The popular prayer - praNodevi saraswati, vajebhirvajinivati, dhinamavitryavatu is a mantra from vedic literature \[ upanishad, brahmana, samhita\].

  

Viswanath
