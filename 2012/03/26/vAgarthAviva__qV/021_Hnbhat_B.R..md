Brahma chasing his daughter in lust into the sky and shot by rudra with arrow the legend behind mRugavyAdha and mRugASHIRsHA (CONSTELLATION) could be traced back to Aitareya brahmaNa.  
  
This episode has been interpreted differently according to astronomical position of that time by Vedanga Jyotisha who do not like this kind of "ashleela" narration in the holy veda-s.  
  
I am not sure of name there.
