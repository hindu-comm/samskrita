**V**ac, Sanskrit, vac, "speech," Hindu (Vedic), is the goddess of the spoken word. In certain texts she is a daughter of Daksa and the consort of Kasyapa. Alternatively she is the daughter of Ambhrna, and, also, is known by the epithet "queen of the gods." She is the personification of speech and oral communication and, is believed, to be able to lead a man to become a Brahman. Vac also personifies truth and sustains soma, the liquid essence of vision and immortality.

This Hindu goddess' manifestation is thought to have come from the early reliance on the sacred oral teachings "heard" by the *rsis* (holy men) properly intoned and accented, thrust the folk-divinity Vac into prominence. Since effective service depended upon effective speech, the supreme vehicle of knowledge and ritual power… Vac even gained precedence over Agni. As the "Word," Vac is somewhat like the Neo-platonic "logos": Vac is the source of creation, and the mother of the Veda. In the Tantric tradition she is celebrated as Para-vac, Transcendental speech, the mother of all sacred mantras. Later she was associated with the river goddess Sarasvati, whose banks of the sacred river served as fertile soil for the growth of culture.

Vac, although prominent in the *Rg Veda*, almost completely disappears from Hindu mythology later when being syncretized with Sarasvati. She is generally depicted as an elegant womanly figure, dressed in gold, but in a secondary capacity as a mother goddess, who is also drawn as a cow. *A.G.H.*

**Vāk** or **Vāc** (stem *vāc-*, nominative *vāk*) is the Sanskrit word for "speech", "voice", "talk", or "language", from a verbal root *vac-* "speak, tell, utter".

  

Vāk is often identified with Sarasvati  

Personified, Vāk is a goddess; most frequently she is identified with Bharati or Sarasvati, the Goddess of speech. In the Veda she is also represented as created by Prajapati and married to him; in other places she is called the mother of the Vedas and wife of Indra.^([](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81c#cite_note-vacref-1))

In the Rigveda (books 2 to 7), *vāc-* refers to the voice, in particularly the voice of the priest raised in sacrifice. She is personified only RV 8 and RV 10, in RV 10.125.5 speaking in the first person (trans. Griffith)

  

The intimate connection with speech, sacrifice and creation in Rigvedic thought is expressed in RV 10.71.1-4:

1\. *bŕhaspate prathamáṃ vācó ágraṃ / yát praírata nāmadhéyaṃ dádhānāḥ*

*yád eṣāṃ śréṣṭhaṃ yád ariprám âsīt / preṇâ tád eṣāṃ níhitaṃ gúhāvíḥ*

2\. *sáktum iva títa'unā punánto / yátra dhîrā mánasā vâcam ákrata*

*yátrā sákhāyaḥ sakhyâni jānate / bhadraíṣāṃ lakṣmîr níhitâdhi vācí*

3\. *yajñéna vācáḥ padavîyam āyan / tâm ánv avindann ŕṣiṣu práviṣṭām*

*tâm ābhŕtyā vy àdadhuḥ purutrâ / tâṃ saptá rebhâ abhí sáṃ navante*

4\. *utá tvaḥ páśyan ná dadarśa vâcam / utá tvaḥ śṛṇván ná śṛṇoty enām*

*utó tvasmai tanvàṃ ví sasre / jāyéva pátya uśatî suvâsāḥ*

RV 8.100:

10\. *yád vâg vádanty avicetanâni / râṣṭrī devânāṃ niṣasâda mandrâ*

*cátasra ûrjaṃ duduhe páyāṃsi / kvà svid asyāḥ paramáṃ jagāma*

11\. *devîṃ vâcam ajanayanta devâs / tâṃ viśvárūpāḥ paśávo vadanti*

*sâ no mandréṣam ûrjaṃ dúhānā / dhenúr vâg asmân úpa súṣṭutaítu*

Vak also speaks, and is described as a goddess, in RV 8.100:

10\. *yád vâg vádanty avicetanâni / râṣṭrī devânāṃ niṣasâda mandrâ*

*cátasra ûrjaṃ duduhe páyāṃsi / kvà svid asyāḥ paramáṃ jagāma*

11\. *devîṃ vâcam ajanayanta devâs / tâṃ viśvárūpāḥ paśávo vadanti*

*sâ no mandréṣam ûrjaṃ dúhānā / dhenúr vâg asmân úpa súṣṭutaítu*

RV 1.164.45 has:

*catvâri vâk párimitā padâni / tâni vidur brāhmaṇâ yé manīṣíṇaḥ*

gúhā trîṇi níhitā néṅgayanti / turîyaṃ vācó manuṣyā̀ vadanti
