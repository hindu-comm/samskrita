The below is the extract of your earlier message.

  

  

Please note the date Kālidāsa lived. Saraswathi emerged as a later goddess from the name of an ancient river which has since dried up.

  

By goddess you might not have meant the Goddess as depicted in the PurAna-s as वीणापुस्तकधारिणी female goddess called सरस्वती, This is certainly a later development from the personified form of वाच् in the ऋग्वेदसंहिता (yajus -have got different deities than ऋग्. both have compendiums called देवतानुक्रमणी and the ब्राह्मण-texts (the forerunners of Puranic legends.)
