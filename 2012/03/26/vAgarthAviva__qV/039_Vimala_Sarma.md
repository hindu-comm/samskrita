"Kumārasaṃbhavam of Kālidāsa - Fifth Canto text and English translation". Editor - Dr Rabindra Kumar Panda, Publishers BKP (Bharatiya Kala Prakashan), 2nd Edition, 2006, Printed by BDH Printers at Salasar Imaging System, Delhi 35. ISBN 81-86050-23-x. I think he is strongly implying it, by saying it is different from the elegant and subtle imagery language of K. But Bhat Mahodaya is questioning if he has mistaken chapter 7 for chapter 8.
