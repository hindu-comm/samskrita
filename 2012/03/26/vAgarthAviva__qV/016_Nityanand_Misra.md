It is not necessary that the उपमान and the उपमेय have the same gender. Many a time the female is compared to a चातक to her lover who is compared to the मेघ - चातक and नायिका do not have the same gender. Furthermore, even if one were to enforce the common gender on the उपमान and the उपमेय, Kalidasa himself says in Kumarasambhava that the feminine and masculine aspects are the aspects of the same Brahman.  
  

स्त्रीपुंसावात्मभागौ ते भिन्नमूर्तेः सिसृक्षया ।  
प्रसूतिभाजः सर्गस्य तावेव पितरौ स्मृतौ । । २.७ । ।  

  

"The feminine and the masculine are the divisions of Your own, of One whose form was split (into two) out of a desire to sire. These two came to be known as the mother and the father of the creation forming a part of the (process of) generation.\[2.7\]"  

  

The alternate parsing of the Samaasa as पार्वतीपः शिवः रमेश्वरश्च तयोरितरेतरद्वन्द्वः पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ is acceptable. In addition to father, पिता can mean the protector - पातीति रक्षतीति पिता (पा + तृच्). A question may arise as to why Shiva and Vishnu could be called as fathers (progenitors), or how Shiva could be called as protector if that is the meaning. My answer would be Kalidasa says in Kumarasambhava that the देवत्रयी of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva - the progenitor, protector and destroyer are essentially aspects of the same Brahman.  

  

तिसृभिस्त्वमवस्थाभिर्महिमानमुदीरयन् ।  
प्रलयस्थितिसर्गाणामेकः कारणतां गतः । । २.६ । ।  
  

"Bringing forth your glory by the means of your three states (of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva), You, Who is the One, become the cause of generation, protection and destruction.\[2.6\]  
  
There could be multiple interpretations of the same verse. This only enhances poetic beauty by the श्लेष figure of speech. In fact, पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ could also be parsed as  
  
पार्वतीपर - मेश्वरौ - पार्वत्याः परः इति पार्वतीपरः शिवः (the Supreme Lord of Parvati) किंवा पार्वती परा येन इति पार्वतीपरः शिवः (with whom or due to whom Parvati is परा or supreme), मायाः लक्ष्म्याः ईश्वरः इति मेश्वरः, तयोरितरेतरद्वन्द्वः पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ.  
  
Other parsings are also possible but I will save that for another day.
