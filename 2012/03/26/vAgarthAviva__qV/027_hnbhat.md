It has been accepted generally by the rhetoricians though some consider the similarity of genders used in respect of उपमान and उपमेय are contributing to the beauty of the उपमा, and in certain cases they may be impoverish the beauty of the poetry in which case it is considered as a poetic blemish. This is the general standard.

  

न लिङ्गवचने भिन्ने न हीनाधिकतापि वा\|

उपमादूषणायालं*यत्रोद्वेगो न धीमताम्*। । \|२.५१ । ।

काव्यादर्श of दण्डिन्,

retaken by Bhoja also:

  

यद्भिन्नलिङ्गमित्युक्तं विभिन्नवचनं च यत् ।

उपमादूषणं तन्न*यत्रोद्वेगो न धीमताम्*।। १.१२० ।।  

  

in his सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण with enough examples where they are considered as poetic blemishes.

  

I don't think the present case does come within the rule or the exception as both are in masculine gender पार्वती-परमेश्वरौ(उपमेय)and वागर्थौ (उपमान). I don't see any occasion for the invoking the rule and its exceptions here.
