PS: Just realized that the example to illustrate different genders of and was not quite right as theनायिकाis usually compared to theचातकी. However, the eye of the (लोचनम्orनेत्रम्), having the neuter gender, is often compared to theचातक. Here is a better example, also from the Kumara epic, where theउपमेय वाच्,is feminine while theउपमान हविष् (हविस्),has the neuter gender.
