The question was the word whether "Sarasvati" is identified with the वाच् in the Vedic Period.

  

":देवीं वाचमजनयन्त देवाः" etc. could easily be interpreted as the human language playing an important part in men's life as the media of communication, in linguististic terms the faculty of speech, or living language (by which people live).

  

Deification and identification with the Puranic goddess of Sarasvati is the focus of the discussion in this topic and Ajit's explanations all focus the importance of वाच् as one of the देवता-s if supported by the देवतानुक्रमणी related to the सूक्त or सर्वानुक्रमणी relating to each ऋक्.

  

Lexicographers mingle both the idea of speech faculty in general and the Goddess सरस्वती, the presiding deity of learning as developed in PurANa-s. Classical writers refer to वाक् also:

  

"यं ब्रह्माणमियं देवी वाग्वश्येवान्ववर्तत।" भवभूति,

"देवीं वाचमुपासते हि बहवः सारं तु सारस्वतं जानीते नितरामसौ गुरुकुलक्लिष्टो मुरारिः कविः।" मुरारिः

  

Also follow the same learning and the deity identified by वाच् and सरस्वती, follow the identification with Brahma (?):

    ३५२) ब्राह्मी*तु*भारती भाषा*गीर्वाग्वाणी*सरस्वती।

    

    

      

    

    

    as Amara considers synonymous terms.
