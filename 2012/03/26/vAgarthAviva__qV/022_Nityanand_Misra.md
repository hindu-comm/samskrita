To the best of my knowledge, the authorship of cantos nine to seventeen of Kumarasambhavam is disputed and they are mostly considered to be work of a later poet. Eighth is disputed by some authors and shunned by many Samskrta Gurus but most accept Kalidasa as the author, even Mallinath commented on it. Cantos one to seven are universally attributed to Kalidasa.

  

I would be interested to refer any studies that doubt the authorship of cantos six and seven.
