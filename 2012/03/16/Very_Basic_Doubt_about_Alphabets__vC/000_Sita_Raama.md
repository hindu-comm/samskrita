Namaste all,

Yesterday I was thinking about some words - खग: (खं + गा) - one that travels in space.

Similarly alaphabets (अक्षर = अ + क्षर ) -Negative particle + change. Once a word is broken down to itsalphabets, it will not go through any further change.

my question is **why vowels are called Svarah and consonants called Vyanjana. ?**

I am sure there must be an explanation for it, can somebody please tell me?

  

regards

Raama
