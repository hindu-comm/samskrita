Hello Raama,

I am not knowledged abiut the actual reasons why the vowels are called svarah and consonants called vyanjanas,

but hereis what was told to us by our teacher in school about svarah and vyanjana

svarah are the pure sounds - unaffected by language / dialect , which humans can produce or the language of music/ notes.

whereas the vyanjanas are the "flavourings" of the languages, the vyanjanas provide the ability to use the same sound in variety of ways like flavourings can be used to change the taste of the basic food ingredients.
