You can search Linux man pages for sed, grep and awk. Very easy to use but extremely powerful tools to say, extract first few words of each verse, et cetera. Then you can use sort command in Linux or in a spreadsheet on the Unicode to generate the alphabetical list. Many resources on Internet to help with these, Google search would help.

  

I can give an example sometime in future, it will be easier if you can share a few verses of your example source file. Plain text would do, anyway the Linux tools work on text files and not dic.
