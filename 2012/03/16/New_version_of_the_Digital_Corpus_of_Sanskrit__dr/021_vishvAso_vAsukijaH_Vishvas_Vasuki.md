Dear Oliver,

  

To add another request: I would love a devanAgarI interface to [the search page](http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=abfrage) (so that I wont have to click around to find the right way to punch the characters).

  

If that's too much work, you could simply provide an interface which accepts any of the popular transliteration schemes (see [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration)) - I can then write a devanAgarI interface for it without any trouble (as I did for [another german sanskrit tool](http://sanskritnlp.appspot.com/forms/Chandas-de.htm).).
