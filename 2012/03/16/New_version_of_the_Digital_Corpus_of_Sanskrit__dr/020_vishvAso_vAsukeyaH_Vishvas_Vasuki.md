Recently I had occasion to use your server again, and it ocured to me that it would be very convenient if I could, for a given book and chapter, get a distinct url which would take people to that exact page directly. Technically, it would be a simple change to enable GET protocols (along with POST), I imagine..

  

\[One thing I like about reading texts from your server is that one can see roots for each word - that definitely would benefit study-groups such as mine grown in our mastery of the language.\]
