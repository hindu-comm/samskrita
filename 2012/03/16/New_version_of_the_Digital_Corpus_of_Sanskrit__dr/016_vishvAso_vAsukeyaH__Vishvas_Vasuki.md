Excellent! That is precisely what I seek too - raw data - in any of the popular formats like csv or tsv, which I can then cut, filter, sort as required, and use in a spreadsheet program of my choice.  
  
While at it, may I request that samskrita content be printed in devanAgarI too (eg one could have two columns: word in devanAgarI, word in latin alphabet rather than just the latter) - because I am not familiar with convenient command line sanskrit-script converters (though I am sure they exist).
