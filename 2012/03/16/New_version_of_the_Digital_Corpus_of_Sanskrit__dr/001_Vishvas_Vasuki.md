Dear Dr Hellwig,

  

I came across your wonderful website, and I had a request to make that would doubtless help many samskrita students and scholars.  
  
Could you please publish a table listing for each word (occurring, say in the rAmAyaNa or mahAbhArata) the frequency with which it appears, together with any other data you may have about the word? It would additionally be helpful if you were to repeat the exercise for all texts in your corpus (not just the great epics), just for comparison.  
  
These tables would help samskrita students worldwide improve their knowledge of samskrita vocabulary - they could prioritize learning the most frequently occurring words in typical texts they may be interested in.

Humble regards and much anticipation,

Vishvas
