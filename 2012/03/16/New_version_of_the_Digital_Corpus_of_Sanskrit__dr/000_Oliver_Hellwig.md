Dear list,  
  
a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit is now available at  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php>  
  
Current version 1.6 contains, among other new features, a public  
interface for discourse semantic annotation (FrameNet, co-annotators  
are welcome), a (hopefully) nicer display of query results, and a  
"Book search" function for scanned Sanskrit books.  
  
Please refer to  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_center>  
for an overview of added texts and features.  
  
As always, feedback and ideas for improving interface and  
functionality are highly appreciated.  
  
  
Best regards,  
Oliver Hellwig
