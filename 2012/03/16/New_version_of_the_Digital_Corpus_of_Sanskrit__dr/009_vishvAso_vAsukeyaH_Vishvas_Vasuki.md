Dear Dr Hellwig,  
  
You got it! I did test the details pages for words in the corpus, but the following is exactly what I seek:  
  
"Word" "Mbh Frequency" "Ra Frequency" .. "word type" "link to details"  
"ca" 10000 9700 .. "avyaya" "..."  
"tad" 9998 7899 .. "prAtipadikam" "..."  
...  
  
Extra annotations like "word type" etc.. could be anything you see fit; but more the details the better - readers can always ignore extra columns.  
  
I am very optimistic that such tables would help people seeking mastery of words - that they may be delighted by Sanskrit word-smithery and be great word-smiths themselves. They would be akin to modern improvements (in a manner of speaking) over compendia like amarakosha, which were used for that purpose.
