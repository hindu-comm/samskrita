Dear Oliver,  
  
Thank you! It is a delight to puruse. Who knew that khara appears over 150 times in the रामायण! I had a few suggestions which might increase the delight of users. In the order of roughly decreasing priority, they are:  
  
1 It may be a good idea to allow users to see the bigger of the following lists, rather than the current cutoff of 500 :  
\*\* The list of all words appearing more than - say 10 - times in the text.  
\*\* The list of 500 most frequent words.  
  
The rationale for the above is that this would be a better filter for important words. Right now, the 500th most frequent word in mahAbhArata is आप् (appearing over 260), times. I wager words appearing 50 times would be interesting too. (rAmAyaNa and mahAbhArata loaded quite quickly for me. I would be happy to wait longer for the page to load..)  
  
2 It would be nice to see the word list in devanAgarI, the way I can the rest of the corpus website.  
  
3 On clicking a word, the [description](http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=einzelwort&IDWord=58785) page in a new tab. If one needs to go back to the word-list from the description page, the word list needs to get reloaded, which is can be a slow process. Of course users can open the page themselves in a new window.  
  
  
In any case, thanks again for this excellent feature!
