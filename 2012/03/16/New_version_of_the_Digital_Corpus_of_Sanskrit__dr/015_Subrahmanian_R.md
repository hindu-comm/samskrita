Respected Sirs,



I happen to have a list of words occurring in the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Obviously it was downloaded by me from the net as part of a collection. This may be useful for the purpose mentioned, though it lists each word only once and does not facilitate frequency count.



Respectfully

R Subrahmanian
