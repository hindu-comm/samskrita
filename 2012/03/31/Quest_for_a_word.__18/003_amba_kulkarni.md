I searched the word "नैतिक\*" through the Search Engine (http://  
[sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in:8080/serachengine](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in:8080/serachengine)).  
I could not get it in महाभारत, रामायण, पुराणs and other texts  
available at GRETIL, the texts available at Digital Corpus for  
Sanskrit.  
But I found several usages of this word in the modern Sanskrit  
literature.

None of them, however, reported any occurrence of नैतिकता.
