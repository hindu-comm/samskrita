If the word नैतिक can be derived as one following नीति- , moral code of conduct, according to grammar, नैतिकता or अनैतिकता could be derived as meaning the state of being नैतिक, or अनैतिक in other words, abiding to the rules or moral conduct.

  

But as Aravindji has reflectd, the word नैतिक is not listed in the Dictionaries and it may be or may not be possible to derive on the analogy of नैष्ठिक, यौगिक etc. formation and possibly not found in ancient texts on a first search.
