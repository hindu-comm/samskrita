The meaning of the word नीति as found in the usage of modern Indian  
languages is somewhat more restricted than the meaning of that word in  
classical literature. The word is used today almost exclusively in  
the sense of moral or righteous behaviour. This sense was of course  
present in the older usage but it had several other meanings too  
attached to it. Monier Williams cited these several other meanings.  
  
The words नैतिकता and अनैतिक naturally flow from the modern  
restricted usage of the word नीति. While not incorrectly formed, it  
does not appear that they would convey the same sense in the older  
times as they do now.  
  
The words नैतिकता or अनैतिक have not been separately listed in MW.
