Here also it is not prohibited by"अचो रहाभ्यां द्वे" which prescribes the "dvitva" for यर् due to the maxim that the explicit mention of रेफ as the निमित्त for द्वित्व, makes it exempt from being कार्यी because of being included in the प्रत्याहार - यर्. Hence it does not enjoy the result of the operation of द्वित्व within the purview of the rules that prescribe द्वित्व. In the example, हर्यनुभवः - the रेफ़ being in the target of the operation of द्वित्व according to the rule "अनचि च" in the state हर्+य्+य्+अनुभवः - रेफ is after the अच्, and not followed by any अच्, and itself being included in the यर्, it should have been duplicated. But this maxim makes it exempt from the कार्य everywhere in the context of duplication.

  

According to this interpretation, the रेफ in धात्रंशः is exempt from being the target of duplication by any rule or vartika. In धात् त् र् + अंशः, and पित्+त्+र् +इच्छा the case is same. "मय उत्तरस्य यणः द्वे वाच्ये" makes it target for the duplication, but due to the above mentioned regulation, it is exempt from the target. The same as सुद्ध्य्युपास्यः with duplicated य्. but in these two, the रेफ doesn't take duplication. This is the real state of things as I understand it.
