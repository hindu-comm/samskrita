I have already explained why the रेफ it is not duplicated according to बालमनोरमा. There is another view that it is duplicated, but lost by "रो रि" and resultant is only single रेफ in the sandhi form as presented in this case by मितभाषिणी commentary of SR Ray to maintain the single "r" in the example. But his view doesn't hold good in the case of har+y+y+anubhavaH - where his interpretation, as "अनचि च" इति रेफस्य द्वित्वे, तस्य "रो रि" इति लोपः, cannot hold good in this case of ह-र्-यनुभबः - mutatis mutandis as here if the duplicated "r" is elided by the "रो रो", it mandates the elongation of the preceding vowel "a" after the loss of the duplicated "r" and will result in undesirable form हा{र्\]र्+य्+अश्वः - which is not desirable. Hence बालमनोरमा resorts to prohibiting it the status of कार्यि since it is explicitly mentioned as निमित्त in the above सूत्र which follows in its explanation of प्रौढमनोरमा. Hence कुमुदरञ्जन's explanation is hard to accept in this case, unless he resorts to some other means to avoid the elongation according to "ढ्रलोपे पूर्वस्य दीर्घोऽणः" which is probably absent in कालाप व्याकरण or some other alternative explanation for ढ्रलोपे but not clear.
