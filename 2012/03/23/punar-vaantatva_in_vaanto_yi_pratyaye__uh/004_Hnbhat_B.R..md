Not double "v", but only the same अव् is confirmed as वान्त so that it never loses its state of being वान्त due to any other operation. This was the purpose of the प्रश्लेष. वान्त एव वान्तादेशः is the correct interpretation to show that it never loses व् as it is specifically instructed by this प्रश्लेष as वान्त. वकारो न लुप्यते इति यावत् makes its purpose clear.
