It is correct to apply "येन विधिस्तदन्त्यस्य" to the विधि, which is already there वान्तो यि प्रत्यये, extended to गोर्यूतौ छन्दस्युपसंख्यानम्, and अध्वपरिमाणे च, but to avoid its loss due to लोपः शाकल्यस्य, it is further qualified as "वान्त". It is still समानाधिकरण to the वान्त already following from the सूत्र and gives only one अव् ending as it is वान्त ever.

  

Just like this, "गुणः, वृद्धिः, इको गुणवृद्धी" in the order of the सूत्र, giving the intended explanation, explicitly mentioned by the term गुण and वृद्धि, the functions of गुण and वृद्धि are applicable to इक्, unless otherwise specified. (अनियमे नियमकारिणी परिभाषा). दिव औत् - does not go to the इक्, as the औ is a वृद्धि prescribed by definition, but not prescribed explicitly as वृद्धि using the technical term. Hence it goes to the end following "अलोऽन्त्यस्य". Such are the techniques of splitting and modifying.

  

It is a common technique to use प्रश्लेष to avoid undesirable applications. Just like in "नाज्झलौ" it is split as आ+अच् - आच्, हल् च, to avoid सवर्ण between आ and हकार. Another technique is to split the सूत्र to get intended form, even though normal संहिता may not accommodate such forms normally split.
