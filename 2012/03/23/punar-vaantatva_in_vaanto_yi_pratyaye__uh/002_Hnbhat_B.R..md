As I had suggested simply because there are not two आदेश-s in this case, But only one, and that too applicable to गव्यूतिः - to retain व् in the आदेश. The वकारप्रश्लेष is done only to avoid the operation of "लोपः शाकल्यस्य" in गव्यूति, and by prescribing श्रूयमाणवकारान्त एवादेशः स्यात्, वकारो न लुप्यते इति यावत्। as explained by Bhattoji Dikshita.

  

I don't know how you got your interpretation.

  

Further, the प्रश्लेष of व् is not necessary in the सूत्र itself व् वान्तो यि प्रत्यये as without splitting it, नाव्यम्, गव्यम् etc. are not targeted by "लोपः शाकल्यस्य" which needs पदान्त-यकार for its operation. In these two cases, य् is not in the पदान्त, as it is modified by the "यचि भम्" which makes it lose its status as पद. The remaining is गव्यूति only in which गो + अव् - गव् - the पदान्त because of its earlier state as पद.

Hence, वान्त एव वान्त आदेशः is the result of this प्रश्लेष and not two वान्तादेश-s. Because it is made explicitly वान्त in the वार्तिक by the प्रश्लेष, the resultant effect is overruling the operation of "लोपः शाकल्यस्य".

  

Sorry I quoted "हलि सर्वेषाम्" in this context as व् is not included in the सूत्र but only य्.
