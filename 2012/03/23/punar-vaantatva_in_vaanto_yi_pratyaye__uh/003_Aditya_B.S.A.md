So, to confirm, there is only one addesha of the form अव्व्? 

  

I don't know how you got your interpretation.  

  

From yena vidhih tadantasya, I interpretedthatव्as a visheshanam forअव्implies the presence of two अव्'s. But, as you pointed out, it doesn't fall in line with the regular interpretation; because व्'s visheshanatva-dharma towardsअव्implies saamaanaadhikaraNya.

  

Thanks for the clarification.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
