It is not that there are two वान्त आदेश-s as you consider. There is only one वान्त आदेश, and to avoid it from being lost due to the operation of "हलि सर्वेषाम्" in the case of गव्यूतिः, the वान्त आदेशः, itself qualified with वान्त. So that the वान्त आदेशः in the case of "अध्वपरिमाणे च" is also not lost due to the operation of the "लोपः शाकल्यस्य" or "हलि सर्वेषाम्" as the व् is confirmed by the prescribing rule "गोर्यूताव्व् छन्दसि" to be interpreted as "श्रूयमाणवान्तादेशः" which itself makes it exempt from the operation of the rule as explained in the text of कौमुदी itself.
