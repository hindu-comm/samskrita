नमो नमः

  

From what I understand, the situation is like this:

  

1\. When we're looking at the word गव्यूतिः the vakaara could optionally attain lopa from lopah shaakalyasya.

  

2\. Since this is anishtam, a way out is provided by adding a
'prashlishta va-kaara' before 'vanto' in the sutram vanto yi pratyaye, or adding the 'prashlishta va' before chandasi in the vartikam gOryootau chandasyupasankhyaanam, with the explanation that the va-kaara is not heard, because of 'lopo vyorvali.'

  

3.This results in the prashlishta vakaara becoming the visheshaNam for 'vaantah,' and by yena vidhih tadantasya, this connotes the meaning 'vaante sati vaantah,' which indicates a double aadesha.

  

4. So in the case of गो यूतिः, the first अव्-aadesha falls victim to the optional lopa of lopah shaakalyasya, but there's a second aadesha waiting in the ranks to take its place.

  

5. This second aadesha is immune to lopah shaakalyasya because from its viewpoint lopah shaakalyasya has not happened in the first place (poorvatrasiddham), so it sees गव् यूतिः, and because of 'vaante sati vaantah,' it goes and sits on top of the अव्.

  

6. As for the doubt that lopah shaakalyasya would act again on the second अव्-aadesha,I'm not exactly sure why it would not; but I assume it's because a sutra operates only once in a given place, and once its operation is finished, it exhausts its applicability for the same operation in the same place, though it might be applicable in another operation at the same place or in another place in the same word.

  

This saves the word गव्यूति: from the abyss of anishtatva.

  

I would greatly appreciate some further clarifications in this matter.

  

On a personal note, I'm blown away by how muchSanskritgrammarians have striven to preserve the language, almost word by word, it seems, from degradation in any manner.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya BSA.
