Just you have to know grammar of Sanskrit which is a prerequisite for understanding any book on grammar. The kRt suffixes are added to verbal roots to get their participles following the rules of Ashtadhyayi of Panini. The text gives the roots in the alphabetical order with enough information on grammar to derive the words from the roots with the suffixes added in the list in a certain order.  
The book is published in 5 volumes and covers all the commonly known forms of the verbs. Sri Vatsankacharya and other grammarians had compiled it. Only a part is available on the DLI site or so. Not all.
