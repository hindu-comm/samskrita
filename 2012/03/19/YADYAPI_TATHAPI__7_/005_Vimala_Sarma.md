The sentence construction is where you have a subordinate clause and a main  
clause using a relative pronoun, yadi (if.........such and such) and tatha,  
a co-relative (then, in that way, likewise,... so...), the second part is  
the main sentence.  
Here it combined with api: tathApi has the sense of nevertheless, and  
yadyapi has the sense of - moreover if, or even though  
So the sentence construction will be something like - Even though (eg one  
does something) nevertheless (eg something will not occur).
