I don't think it is necessary to have "tathaapi" also, but a co-relative clause is enough. But with ":tathaapi" is idiomatic expression.

  

In the above it is related, with the next verse:

  

1.  

    

    कथं*न*ज्ञेयमस्माभिः पापादस्मान्निवर्तितुम् ।

    

    

    *कुलक्षयकृतं दोषं*प्रपश्यद्भिर्जनार्दन ॥१-३९॥

    

    

      

    

    

    Even though these people do not see , due to their minds blurred by
    their greediness, the evils of the genocide and the sin by betraying
    friends,

    

    

    \[then\] how we,who can see this evil of genocide,could not
    understand itin order to refrain from this evils.
