Sharmaji,

  

There are some very good examples in page 5 of the pdf attached. It is from <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/Symposium/>

  

'Yadyapi' is used sometimes without 'tathaapi' as in Gita 1.38

यद्यप्येते न पश्यन्ति लोभोपहतचेतसः ।  
कुलक्षयकृतं दोषं मित्रद्रोहे च पातकम् ॥१-३८॥

  

I request scholars of this group to explain whether 'tathaapi' is optional while using 'yadyapi'.  



regards  
shankara

My teacher today told an example using YADYAPI and TATHAPI, but i  
didnot understand the exact meaning of those words. Anybody please  
explain me how to make sentence using these two words.
