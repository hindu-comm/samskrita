यद्यपि बहु नाधीषे तथापि पठ पुत्र व्याकरणम्।  
स्वजनो श्वजनो माऽभूत्सकलं शकलं सकृत्शकृत्॥

Son, even if you do not become very learned, yet do study grammar, so  
that स्वजन does not become श्वजन (a dog), सकल (the whole) does not  
become शकल (a broken piece), nor does सकृत् (one time) become शकृत्  
(a dung heap).
