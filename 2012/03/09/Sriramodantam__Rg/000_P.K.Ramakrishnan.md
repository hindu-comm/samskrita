Sriramodantam in Sanskrit is a condensed story of Rama based on Valmikiramayana.

  

This is in simple Sanskrit and was very popular in Kerala up to some 60 years

ago for beginners.  Theauthor's name is said to be Parameswaran but there is

no confirmation on this.  

  

I got the entire kavyam from the internet in Malayalam script. I have converted the

Balakaandam into Devanagari script which I am giving in the attachment. Ishall attempt to put the other kandams also one by one depending on the responseof the learned members of the group.
