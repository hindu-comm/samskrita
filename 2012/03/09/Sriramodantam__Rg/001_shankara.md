PK Ramakrishnanji,

  

I had prepared an ebook of Sriramodantam with Sanskrit text and a translation of my own. You could download it from <http://sanskritebooks.org/2010/07/sriramodantam-sanskrit-text-with-english-translation/>  

  

Suggestions to improve the translation are welcome.  



regards  
shankara
