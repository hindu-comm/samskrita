I just posted the extract from Vicki page to highlight the inspiration for such name.

  

"Sindhu" is certtainly a Sanskrit word according to Monier Williams which may denote a region Indus valley or a river (nada) with the same name. But may not denote what is now called as the Hindusthana as claimed by the Agama cited:

  

Ë m. and f. (prob. fr. É1 . {sidh} "' , to go "') a river , stream (esp. the Indus , and in this sense said to be the only river regarded as m.
{-nada} , col. 2) RV. &c. &c.  

  

According to the Agama cited in the Vicki article, the word "hindusthana" itself a Sanskrit word if it can be accepted as authentic enough.(and "hindu" included in the compound also the part of the word).

  

I have no opinion on its acceptability as Sanskrit word.
