I am not sure also, if its a sanskrit name, I wanted to verify with the group if it is.

Now a days people don't need rhyme and reason to name but I was curious to know.

Since there was "हैमवति" and हैन्दवतिsounds very similar to that.

So I wanted to check if people here have some opinion or knowledge about it.
