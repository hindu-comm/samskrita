It is हैन्दवती and not हैन्धवती. हैन्दवी could be easily derived from the word हिन्दु \<\< सिन्धु - which is regionally popular for anything related to Hindu.

  

The word*Hindu*is derived from the[Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")word*Sindhu*, first mentioned in the[Rig Veda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rig_Veda "Rig Veda"),^([\[3\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu#cite_note-2))was the historic local appellation for the[Indus River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River "Indus River")in the northwestern part of the[Indian subcontinent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent").^([\[4\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu#cite_note-3))

The Brihaspati Agama says:

[TABLE]

  
The usage of the word*Hindu*was further popularized for Arabs and further west by the[Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic")term*[al-Hind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hind "Al-Hind")*referring to the land of the people who live across river Indus^([\[7\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu#cite_note-6))and the[Persian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia "Persia")term Hindū referring to all Indians. By the 13th century,*[Hindustān](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan "Hindustan")*emerged as a popular alternative[name of India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_India "Names of India"), meaning the "land of*Hindus*".^([\[8\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu#cite_note-7))

  

It can be हैन्दवी only and not either हैन्धवी or हैन्दवती or हन्दवती. The above extract is from the Viki page.
