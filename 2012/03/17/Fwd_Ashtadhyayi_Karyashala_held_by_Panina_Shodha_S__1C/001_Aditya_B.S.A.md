नमो नमः

  

Anyone from this forum planning to attend this? Has anyone attended it in the past? I've listened to Vidushi Pushpa Dikshita's cd's and I find them simple and effective to learn with.

  

I'm seriously planning to attend the course, so if anyone has some inputs, I'd like to hear them.

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
