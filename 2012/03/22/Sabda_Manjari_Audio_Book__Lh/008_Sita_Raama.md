Aditya Mahodaya,

I think if you are planning to chat then please do atleast twice. I learned some suktas from a teacher and he always made me say two times min. Often times I wonder why but soon I realized that it gets into your memory faster that way.

  

if you ask my opinion, please do say it twice. Rest is upto your discretion.

Thanks for doing this

regards

Raama
