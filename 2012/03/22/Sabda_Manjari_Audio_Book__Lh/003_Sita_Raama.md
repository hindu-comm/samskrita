I keep listening to Laghu siddhanta Kaumudi talks given by Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati at Arshavidya Gurukulam.

I extracted some shabda & Dhatus out of it. If anyone is interested I uploaded it to my google account and providing share link here. I will keep uploading more as I make progress in the subject.

Its a request, as good of apronunciationas "Aditya Mahodaya" has, if he has time he can record few shabdas so that people don't take "Mark Singleton" rendering as a way tomemorizeshabda manjari.

  

Regards

Raama
