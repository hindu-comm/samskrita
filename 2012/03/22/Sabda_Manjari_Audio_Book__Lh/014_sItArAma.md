I look Swami Tattvavidanandaji's Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi Class.  

He mentioned some Shabda and Dhatus and I extracted some, they are good for beginner because he does not have any western accent and they are easy to learn. I hope few would find it useful.  

here is the link [Shabdas](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B8cMe7fL49e5Qno2SkNnSW1TUGkwZ3B5UkZ3WFF2QQ)  

They are as per Kaumudi Order and if people like it then I can try extracting some more. Else someone with good pronunciation in the group, can create this for greater good.  
  
Regards  

Raama
