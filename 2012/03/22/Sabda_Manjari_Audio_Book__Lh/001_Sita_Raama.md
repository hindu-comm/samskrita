I don't want to belittle the efforts of the author but people who are fluent at any Indian language should not follow these audios as reference.

It could be a good starting point for others who live outside of India and any of the Indian language is not their mother tongue.

Personally I could not hear the entire Raama shabda with all thepronunciationerrors, but thats me
