Namaste,

I am attaching the excel sheet along with this mail. I did not type this, I took the text from here and then did some slicing and dicing.

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/dhatupatha_index_svara.itx>

  

Later used itranslator to convert it to devanagari format, in some of the hidden columns you will also find the original roman text as well.

1.  Added first column "S Number" but it does not meaning anything. I
    added that for sorting, because if you are not careful with excel
    sorting then if can easily mess up entire data. The ref serial
    number helps to restore to original order anytime.
2.  I added an index letter to it, so all dhatus belonging to one letter
    can be sorted and viewed.
3.  Added Skarmakh & Akarmakah field to it. I did not populate entire
    table with these, only ones I could find in Roopachandrika 4.  If there are any typos then please let me know
5.  If you have any difficulty viewing Devanagari text then please get
    this font "CDAC-GISTYogesh" 6.  Auto filter in Excel allows you to filer data based on any criteria.
    AutoFilter must be active when you receive this file, but incase if
    its not then you can simply activate by clicking on
    \>Data>Filter>Autofilter

I do not know about "Set & Anit" and its usage as well.

I also do not know why & how Dhatu meaning how it changes for Parasmaipadai and Atmanepadi

I hope its of some use.

Regards

Raama
