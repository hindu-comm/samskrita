Namaste

I am starting thisdiscussionto understand the bigger picture of Dhatu's

Here is my take on the summary, please pour in your knowledge so we call can benefit from it.

  

  

There are over 2200 dhatus in Sanskrit ( my count in excel came to **2282**)

They are divided into 10 Ganas - starting from Bhvaadi etc. (First Dhatu of the each Gana is assigned a name to present all dhatus that fall under that gana. i.e. bhoo is the first dhatu in first gana - bhoo + aadi becomes bhvaadi , same process repeat 9 more times with other ganas )

  

  

here is what I found via excel sorting and filtering.

  

1.  Number of Dhatus in First Gana (Bhvaadi) = 1170
2.  Number of Dhatus in Fourth Gana (Divaadi) = 161 3.  Number of Dhatus in Sixth Gana (Tudadi) = 179 4.  Number of Dhatus in Tenth Gana (Churaadi) = 500

**Total = 2010 (out of 2282)**

Whats the use of these numbers ?Well, They all rhyme identical to one other - so what ??? you may ask.

  

Memorize the Prasmaipadi and Atmanepadi form (lat, lit, lut lot etc)of these four ganas first

Then essentially you have handle 89% of Dhatu patha, all you have to do is findout under which gana a dhatu falls, rest is cake walk from there.

  

Remaining 272, you can pick on your way as they come.

  

You appreciate the beauty once you start with Bhoo dahtu, there are easy pointers in prasmai pada -

Lat and lrut rhyme with similar ending and little variation in the beginning.

  

Please share your thoughts
