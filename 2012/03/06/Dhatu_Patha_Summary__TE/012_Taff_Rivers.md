Ramana,

  

 You appear to have answered your own question viz. 'an uncommon root'.

  

Surely, you are aware that there cannot be such a thing as a definitive 'grammar book', it's the particular usages to which words are put, in given sentences in given texts that determine their entry, or otherwise, in a grammar book'.

  

Differrent compilers in differrent eras had access to differing amount of material.

  

Even the mighty MW's 'Grammar book' comes in a number of versions.

There's his Elementary grammar, then there's his Practical Grammar, second edition, which has a number of 'to grow old' but none that match your cutout.

  

Regards,

  

 Taff Rivers.
