नमो नमः

  

In the 'prakriyaa', the process of attaining a construct that is ready-to-use, there is always a prakruti bhaaga and a pratyaya bhaaga. Prakruti bhaaga would be your dhaatu in the case of tinganta and your praatipadika in the case of subanta. And pratyaya would be tingaadi, subaadi, taddhita or krut.

  

In the case of verbs, there are two pratyaya categories. Ting and Krut. (You use either one with the dhaatu).

  

A dhaatu always connotes a phala, 'result' and a vyaapaara, 'action.' In the case of 'pachati' (cooks), dhaatu 'pach' connotes 'softening/mellowing (the 'cooked' state), as the result and the action that is convenient to such result (placing the vessel on the stove, etc). So the meaning of 'pach' is 'action that is convenient to the softening/mellowing/cooked-form as a result.' 

  

Similarly with gacchati (goes): Gam dhaatu connotes attainment as the result and the corresponding action that is convenient for such result. (walking, driving, flying, etc).

  

Similarly with vardhate (grows): Vrudh dhaatu connotes growth as the result and the corresponding action that is convenient for such result.

  

(Note that with gam and pach, the entity or state that is vested with the property of being the 'result' is different from the action that is convenient for it. व्यापारः अन्यत्र, फलमन्यत्र ।But with vrudh, the entity that is vested with 'resultness' is also vested with the action that is convenient for it. The plant grows, and growth is the result. Dhaatus like vrudh are akarmaka, and dhaatus like gam are sakarmaka).

  

In the ready-to-use forms you hear a ting pratyayaa that is coalesced with the dhaatu form. 'Ti' in pachati, 'te' in vardhate.

  

Ting prayayas denote the following:

  

1\. Kartrukaarakam.

  

OR

  

2\. Karmakaarakam.

  

OR

  

3\. Bhaavah. (Abstract concept).

  

AND

  

4\. Tense/Mood.

  

AND

  

5\. Number. (Exception in the case of bhaava, where ting does not connote number).

  

  

  

What is kaarakam? That which indicates the relationship with the action, or 'kriya' is kaarakam. It can be indicated by the ting pratyaya or the sup-pratyaya in the sentence.

  

Because the ting can indicate either kartru, karma, or bhaava, you have three prayogas, kartari, karmani, and bhave.

  

So in any given scenario, the ting pratyaya denotes 3 things. Karta or karma or bhava, and tense and number.

  

Add to this the phala (result) and vyaapaara (convenient action) of the dhaatu itself (prakruti, as opposed to ting, which is pratyaya), and you have 5 meanings in the case of kartari and karmani, 4 in the case of bhaave. (Also 4 in the case of akaramaka dhaatus, because the result and action are the same).

  

Make sure to carefully read the 'idamavadheyam' part on page 5 to understand the difference between sakarmakatvam and akarmakatvam.

  

The most interesting thing about all this is that understanding this carefully can give you a whole new perspective on the scope and limitation of vibhaktis.

  

All the best,

  

Regards,
