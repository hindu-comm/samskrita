Hello Vimalaji,

check this link,<http://www.mkhalsa.com/lit/indic.html>

you have to install Indic language support, I think thats my guess. Once the installation is complete you have to change your input language method to whatever indian language you choose.

Then it will work accordingly. I hope this helps
