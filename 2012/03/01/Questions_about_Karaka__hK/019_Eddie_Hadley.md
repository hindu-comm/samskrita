Vimala,

The more diacritics and the less ugly old ASCII transliteration schemes, the  
better.

But are we non-MS Word users to understand that Microsoft has changed the  
functioning of the Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys in 2010 (or 2011).  
Or is it simply that some personal macros have been lost, and these are the  
'shortcuts' you are referring to.
