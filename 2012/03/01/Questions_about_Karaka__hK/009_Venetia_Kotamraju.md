Hi Vimala,

I have programmed these diacritical marks into Word (as far as I can tell you need to do it separately for each programme - at least the shortcuts I have programmed for Word don't work in Excel etc). You can use alt+a for dirgha akaara, for the others control + (letter) works fine. In fact I created a document on this last week for Swami Sadatmananda. If it's of use, please see the attached.

I have not found a way to switch from one set of shortcuts to another, but as the shortcuts only apply in one programme it's not really an issue for me. 

Best,

Venetia
