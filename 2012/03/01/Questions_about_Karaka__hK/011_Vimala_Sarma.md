Thanks Venetia

I did this with the last version of word and programmed all the letters with diacritics but the hard drive became corrupted and I now have Word 2010. Word 2010 uses alt + A for a shortcut and many of the other letters also have been used, with cntrl and alt. I have been advised to download "Keyman" and you can switch keyboards with this software. You can use keyboard with M/s shortcuts and then switch to using keyboard with diacritical marks. I will download this soon and will get back to you on how it is working.

Incidentally There was no attachment with your e-mail.

Warm regards

Vimala
