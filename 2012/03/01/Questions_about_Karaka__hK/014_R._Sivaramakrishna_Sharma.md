Namaste Jee,  
  
I generally use 'Diacunic' to key Diacritics (Unicode). It is a non-  
obtrusive and relatively speaking application independent. Best of all  
it can be used in conjunction with any other IME. You can download a  
copy gratis from

I would like to delete that and reprogram but maybe I need to use my keyboard in two modes - one in normal mode with the shortcuts as they are since they are useful in Word, and one which enables me to have letters with diacritical marks programmed. Can anybody help?
