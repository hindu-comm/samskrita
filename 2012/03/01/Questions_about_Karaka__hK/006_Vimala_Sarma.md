Dear Scholars

After a disastrous computer crash I got new laptop and new M/s Office 2010, which has a lot of shortcut keystrokes already in it. The shortcuts I had previously used were lost. This creates difficulties to getting the right letter with diacritical mark programmed as a shortcut.

For example to get ā, I cannot use shortcut key = control+A, because that is already used as a shortcut to select all text. I would like to delete that and reprogram but maybe I need to use my keyboard in two modes - one in normal mode with the shortcuts as they are since they are useful in Word, and one which enables me to have letters with diacritical marks programmed. Can anybody help?
