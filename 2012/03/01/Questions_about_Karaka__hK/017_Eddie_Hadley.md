Vimala,

You have paid your money already to get the diacritic marks, but this  
may be useful for others to know, that need only the occasional use:

  
Can you do this for the macron in your MS 2010:

Within Microsoft Word  
1.  
Open Microsoft Word. Click the "Insert" toolbar (Word 2007 and later).  
Click the "Symbol" icon on the far right-hand side of the ribbon.  
Click "More Symbols."

2.  
Choose the font you want to use. Choose "Latin Extended-A" under the  
"Subset" drop-down menu.

3.  
Double-click on the character you want to insert it directly into your  
document.

  
More info and other options from
