Namaste Nityanand Mahodaya,

You could try Srirangam Digital Technologies in Srirangapattanam. They do digitisation and keying in for such material and have worked with manuscripts although their experience is more towards Kannada and Tamil.


It is run by a mathematics professor in Mysore - Dr Yogananda. I can put you in touch with him for more details if you would like.

I have never actually got any work like this done myself so can't advise on prices but I work with Srirangam Digital Technologies for typesetting and have been impressed by their technical knowledge and I find them reasonably priced.

Best,

Venetia
