Namaste  
  
Does anybody has experience of working with freelancers, businesses or scholars who provide data entry and/or proofreading services for Samskrita texts? I have some old Samskrita manuscripts from 1980s and 1990s which are typed on a typewriter and would like to get them digitized. The works are deep into Samskrita grammar and have quite a few typos as the typist did not have much knowledge of Samskrita. I have some contacts from Justdial but have no idea about the quality of work or if their quotes are reasonable or too high, so would like to learn from the experience of scholars.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
