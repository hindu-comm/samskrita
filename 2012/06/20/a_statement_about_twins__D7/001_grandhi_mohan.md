I am not sure whether this will answer your question. But I have readthat in Srimad Bhagavatam Translated by Srila Prabhupad ISKCON.



InSrimad Bhagavatampurport of sloka 3-17-18 Prabhupad mentions the Vedic literature Pinda Siddhi. Purport runs like this.



There is an authoritative Vedic literature called Piëòa-siddhi in which the scientific understanding of pregnancy is very nicely described. It is stated that when the male secretion enters the menstrual flux in the uterus in two successive drops, the mother develops two embryos in her womb, and she brings forth twins in a reverse order to that in which they were first conceived; the child conceived first is born later, and the one conceived later is brought forth first. The first child conceived in the womb lives behind the second child, so when birth takes place the second child appears first, and the first child appears second.
