In one of the lectures of sri bannanje govindacarya, the scholar mentions a statement --

  

"yamayoH purvajAtaH kanIyAn" - of the twins, the first born is younger.

  

in reference to "yaksha prashnaH" of mahabharata, nakula is sent first by yudhishtra, rather than sahadeva. as yudhishtra was sending brothers by order of youngest to eldest, nakula must have been the youngest. but nakula was born before sahadeva.

  

in effect, nakula is agrajaH to sahadeva (born first), but kaneeyaH (younger) to sahadeva, because among the twins, sahadeva was conceived first and so born later.

  

my question is -- any one know what is the source of the above statement -"yamayoH purvajAtaH kanIyAn" ?
