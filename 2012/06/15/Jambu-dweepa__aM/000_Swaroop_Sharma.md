Namaste,

Esteemed friends, please explain me the concept Jambu-Dweepa?

Some consider it to be part of Asia or some say it is restricted to India. While there are others who say Asia and India is itself Jambu-Dweepa. I will be happy if someone can provide me a reference to the term in Ramayana and Mahabharata :-)

Where can we abundantly find the Jambu-vriksha?

Dhanyavad
