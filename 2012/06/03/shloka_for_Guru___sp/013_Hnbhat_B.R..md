Dear Ghare,

  

Thank you for starting a new line of thinking. and thanks for your suggestion.

  

In Indian Literature, the two are intermixed, sciences. Astronomy as different from Astrology and the PurAnic concept of Guru. And for religious dimensions, the description is available in the purANa-s. And, now as the term ग्रह is used in the different domains to denote the current meaning in the related literature. But the English term planet used in the modern Astronomy and physics can hardly convey all the dimensions of the Sanskrit word ग्रह. So also the concept of गुरु synonymous to बृहस्पति, वाचस्पति, देवगुरु are interchangeable in the religious literature and hence extended to the physical bodies in astronomy in the solar system known as ग्रह-s in Sanskrit and also to the presiding deity as well in the domain of astrology which links Puranic concept with the religious aspect of astrology and not necessarily the description in the astronomy need corroborate with it. All the above point out that Astrology borrowed the concept from पुराण-s and not directly from the Vedic dieties except for the similarity of names, which are described in a different way in Vedic Literature. So confusing these concepts current in different domains of literature, won't do any more good to increase our knowledge. Only experts in these domains could draw the line of distinction and it is welcome from the scholars in the related domains in this group.

  

Much more can be found in the related literature in this regard, in which I am not competent, I am sure.

  

With regards
