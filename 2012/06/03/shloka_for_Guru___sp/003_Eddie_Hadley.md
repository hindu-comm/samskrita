All,



 In the MW, I sometimes come across the abbreviation ‘*PBr*.’.

B

ut I don’t see it anywhere in the lists that come after the introductory section in the hardcopy volume that I have.



It occurs only about

148 times in all, but from the context it would appear to be referring to the *Brāhmaṇa* portion of the Veda, the *Brāhmaṇas?*



I do see ‘*ŚBr*.’ referred to rather a lot. My computer tells me there are 6939 of them.

W

ould I be correct in inferring that ‘*PBr*.’ is consistent with ‘*ŚBr*.’ which refers to the

*Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*?



And could anyone tell me what that ‘P’ stands for, I would be guessing that its an alternative way of referring to the same material?



Regards,



 Eddie
