Ajit,



“Pbr stands for Pancavimsa Brahmana a Samveda Brahmana”  

 Thanks, this seems to resolve the issue of the inconsistencies in the MW.



I have noticed that all but three occurrences of ‘PBr.’ appear in the entry for the **a.**

And those three occur towards the start of the **ā**’s.





Regards,



 Eddie
