Sorry for the first translation as it appeared in the text given by you. I was not satisfied with the reading. Hence I searched for other readings which also did not yield satisfactory results.

  

The possible reading would be बुद्धिमन्तं which seems to have been corrupted in both ways buddhi-bhUtam, buddhi-matam etc. which more intelligible for common man than the inflected Sanskrit form, the intelligent one. Literally, the one possessed of best of intelligence. or the most intelligent one.

  

The other satisfactory reading is बुद्धिपूर्णम् - which also means the same, filled with intelligence, or full of intelligence which is not a common adjective.

  

I forgot to add the meaning of sannibha which you asked for. It means "equal to" to the thing denoted by the word in compound which it follows and probably not used independently commonly like तुल्य.

  

Hope the rest it intelligible if you know Sanskrit. I have avoided giving elaborate etymology and commentary so as to be compact and clear in the meaning. If needed it can be provided with comments on each and every word.
