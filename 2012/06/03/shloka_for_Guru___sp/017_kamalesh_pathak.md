Dr. Bhatt sir !

thanks for a detailed description about grahas and planets.

may i ask meaning from a vedic mantra from yajurveda ? is as below.

grahaa urjaa hutayo vyanto vipraay matim.\|\| teshaam vishi priyaaNaam voh misham samagrabha mupayaama grhitoseendraayatvaa jushtam gruhNaa myeshate yoni rindraayatvaa jushtatamam .\|\| (shukla yajurveda adhyaay 9 mantra 4.)  
this mantra is chanted during graha pujanam .

thanks in advance.
