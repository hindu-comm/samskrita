Ajit,



 It is apparent that there were many lexicographers involved.

MW himself, has a few uncomplimentary things to say about them in Section V page xxxi of his introduction.

Viz. ‘a gradual weakening of faith in the trustworthiness of my fellow men’.



The MW was a massive undertaking. Even today an electronic trawl through databases, for concordances of the words so tagged, would be quite a task.

And would probably not be all that illuminating, anyway.



I think, though, that we can probably accept the usage (meaning) given for each of those words, so tagged, even if the source documents they are attributed to are a little dubious.

That the meanings are associated with sacrificial rituals and hymns of praise, in a general sense, is all that is really required.



Thanks,
