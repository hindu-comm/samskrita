Hi ,  
  
As far as I know the meaning is like this  
  

Lord Rama is telling Bharat , that , I am deeply and fully indebted or obliged by what Hanuman has done for me , so , i am his ऋणी . and I will never be able to pay the debt , and become उरिन , i e . opposite of ऋणी ,i.e. in my life I will never be able to become ever , at a stage , when I am without his debt on me , since he has done so much for us . Then he explains what all he did for raama and sita and Lakshman  
  
regards
