Aatmiya Vineetji,  
  

it is a Tulsidasji Bhajan very beautifully sung by Pt. Jasraj ji in Raag Des.

you may listen to the Bhajan as well as enjoy the lyrics with meanings on this link <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgEBI2ikus8>

  
some additional inputs on the youtube video :  
  
at 1:42 it is ऐठो खाय अछूत खवावत, हाथ धोवत तट मांही  
it describes Hanumanji's simplistic (rather rustic) behavior. He does not have the polish or finesse of washing his hands at designated place but washes them in तट (the very dish in which he ate).  
यहां तुलसीदासजीने हनुमानजीको एक भोले गँवार जैसे बताकर, बादमें उनकी शक्तिओंके बारेमें रामजीसे कहलवाकर अनूठा contrast खडा किया है।  
at 3:00 it is लाँघ गयो  
at 3:45 लंका जाय सिया सुधी लाय, गरव नहि मन मांही  
at 4:47 शक्ति बाण... powerful and not 100 (Indrajit hurls his Shakti baan and Lakshman falls unconscious)  
at 6:30 अहिरावण ... In the Ramayana Ahiravan , brother of Ravana,
secretly carried away Rama and Lakshmana to the nether-world, consulted his friends and decided to sacrifice the life of the two divine brothers at the altar of his chosen deity, goddess Mahamaya. But Hanuman saved their life by killing Ahiravan and his army.  
बैठ रह्यो मठ मांही - inspite of such a great velor he humbly confined himself to solitude, not craving for recognition or appreciation.  
at 8:04 को ल्यावत जग मांहि ... who would have brought us back (alive) on earth (but for Hanuman).  
  
a humble attempt to answer your query, hope you would like it.  
  
while listening to Pt. Jasraj ji's rendition, enjoy the sonorous effect created by Sitar and Sarod combo.  
  
a very scintillating and भक्तिभावपूर्ण रचना जिसमें स्वयं भगवान अपने भक्तकी मुक्तमन सराहना करते हैं। हम भी ऐसी ही भक्तिके अधिकारी बन सकें ऐसी प्रभु चरणॊंमें प्रार्थना ।  
हरि ॐ  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
best regards,

Hari Aum.
