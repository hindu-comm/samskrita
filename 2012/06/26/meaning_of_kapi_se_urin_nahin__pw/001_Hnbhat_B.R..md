Here below is the lyrics:

भरतभाई! कपि से उरिन हम नाही \|\|

एठो खाय अछूत खवावत \| हाथ धोवत टक माहि \|\| १ \|\|  
  

  

सौ योजन मर्याद सिंधू की \| लांग गयो पल माहि \|  
लंका जाय सिया सोधी लाये \| गर्ब नाहि मन माहि \|\| २ \|\|  
  
He was able to cross the distance hundred yojana-s of ocean within short time, and reached Lanka and brought the news from thee. But he is not having any pride in it.  

  

शती बाण लग्यो लछमन के \| शोर भयो दल माहि \|  
द्रोणागिरी पर्वत ले आयो \| भोर होने नहि पायी \|\| ३ \|\|

  

Lakshman was hit by hundreds of arrows and there arose calamity in the camp. He brought the Drona mount before the twilight.

  
अहि रावण की भुजा उखाडी \| बैठ रह्यो मठ माहि \|  
या पर भरत जो हनुमत ना होते \| को ल्यावत जग माहि \|\| ४ \|\|  
  

While we stayed in our camp, the arms of Ahiravan was cut down. But if it is were not for Hanuman, who would have brought us back to this world?\*

This is not a story from popular Ramayana. May be some Adbhutaramayana or Anandaramayana, a Ahiravana is mentioned who was defeated by Hanuman as I remember.

  

तुलसीदास मारुतसुत महिमा \| प्रभु अपने मुख से गायी \|  
भरतभाई! कपि से उरिन हम नाही \|\| ५ \|\|

  

Such is the greatness of Hanuman, and my lord praised it with his own mouth. 

  

  

I have no idea of the word meaning. But in the total it seems to convey
his indebtedness to Hanuman, that he could not relieve from indebtedness from Hanuman, the Kapi and remembering the moments by which he was indebted.

  

Some with perfect knowledge of व्रज भाषा may correct my running translation and correct it.

  

With regards
