Dear Members,  
I am not writing this mail to boast about myself but to have a healthy discussion to see if like minded people have some information to share on this topic. Here is my personal experience -

  

In the recent past I have learned Purusha sukta, Sri Sukta, Bhoo Sutka,
Durga sukta and sandhyavandanam over skype. I did not have any prior knowledge of verses of the above mentioned text. The class was once a week on weekends (for about 45 mins to 1 hr).

  

Through out the teaching - my teacher would recite once and I had to correctly repeat it twice after him, if I make a mistake then I have to repeat it 4 times or until I read it correctly twoconsecutivetimes whichever is higher.For first 3 classes he did not allow me to read through text, he used to say "just listen to me and repeat after me."

  

He broke all the big samasas / sentences to smallermanageableparts and once we finish a shloka like that then he would take up quarter verses and then half verses and then full verses. Once we reached to full verses level, take up sets of 5 verses.

  

I recited these verses by looking at the text, after doing this for couple of times, he made me recite the verses without looking at the text. He would fine tune the accents and this method did wonders. Few sessions like that and I could recite these text well in meter with proper accents and without a book.

  

I tried to apply same methodology toAshTAdhyAyi learning. So far I am not disappointed with the results.

  

I managed to add gaps in the AshTAdhyAyi Audio thats available on skydrive created by Sai Susarla & team and split it into parts of 20 sutras. The gap is enough to repeat the sutra two times. After 20 sutras, in the end it includes the first word of next set of 20 sutras as a memory aid to next set. DO NOT go to next set until you memorized the previous set and could recite without looking the text.

  

Once youconquer1st set then go to second set but make sure every time you read first set and then practice second, and the process continues like this for remaining sets - 

for set 3, always read 1 & 2 once before practicing 3 ..... When you recite a set out of your memory without gaps it usually take less than a min. If you follow this pattern the sessions can get really lengthy if you reach to 100th set. At this time use your judgement to see how many sets you can drop as done in Ghanapatha (words get dropped as First in First out sequence)<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_chant>

  

I am attaching one sample file, if anyone is interested then I can upload entire work to skydrive and share the link. **The metadata still gives full credit to theoriginalcreators of the audio files**. I did not add anything of my own or changed anything in the existing audio files, instead of full adhyaayas now it comes in manageableparts of 20 sutra as a set.

  

I know its a long shot but with few weeks of effort I managed to memorize 2 Padas of first adhyaya not a bad start. Each set of 20 sutras take anywhere from 2 to 5 mins. Here are some interesting statistics -

  

|                    |                                  | |--------------------|---------------------------------:| | Total Sets of 20   | 200               | | one set a week     |                             200 | | Two sets a week    |                       100    | | Three sets a week |                               67 | | Four sets a week  |                     50      |

  

Based one how aggressive one is - one can memorize entireAshTAdhyAyi anywhere between 1 to 4 years. "Every Marathon starts with a single step, and a step after ........ "

The key is consistency. Set a pace and stick to it, create a spreadsheet and monitor your progress.

  

Thanks for reading and I would appreciate constructive criticism.

PS:-

I have a dedicated study area, I start with salutations to guru (guruh bramha ....) then recite choosen AshTAdhyAyi set everyday in the morning - I sit in half lotus pose and I do not do any other activities while doing this. I told my family members not to disturb me during this time. 10 - 20 mins a day is manageable as well.

I do not use headphone, I connect my mp3 player to portable speakers, also I do read it loud while repeating it. My teacher said it is important, "when you repeat you should hear your own voice" that helps memorization.Usually people put headphones and listen while doing household work or some other activity, that distracts your mind and is not that effective due to lack of focus.
