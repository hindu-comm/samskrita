Raama,  
 Stumbled upon this post recently. I have been following algorithms similar to you have and have completed 6 chapters. You have not provided any time for repetitions in your methodology and wanted to know how it is working for you. Have you completed the task as per schedule? As you proceed further do you tend to forget the past sutras?  
  
Warm regards,
