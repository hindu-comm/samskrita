Congratulation for your endeavor to learn the whole of Ashtadhyayi by heart. Wish you all the best of success.

  

By the way, do you learn with स्वर? As you are a student of Vedic Learning, you will be able to do so easily the वेदाङ्ग पाणिनीय in the same way as संहितापाठ with स्वर recite easily. This is important as the अधिकार is decided by the स्वरित word in the संहिता till the next स्वरित as it clearly laid down *स्वरितेनाधिकारः(*॥ १।३।११).A सस्वर संहितापाठ of अष्टाध्यायी is published by Dr. Nandita Chaturvedi atपाणिनि कन्या गुरुकुल, वाराणसी.I don't klnow whether it is available in e-text form or soft copy. But you can contact and ask them to provide you a copy.

  

I can give you the contact number personally if you want.

  

  

With regards
