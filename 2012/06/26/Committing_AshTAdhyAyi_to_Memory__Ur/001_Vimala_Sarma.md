RAma Mahodaya

You have a very good teacher on Skype. Will he/she take on other students for Vedic chanting lessons?

You are very dedicated and I am sure you will succeed with the AshTAdhyAyi.

A minor point- I noticed you wrote "bramha" because that is the way you actually say it. But it is prakrit. The actual pronunciation in I my opinion needs to follow "brah/ma" syllables.
