Aryabhata however describes a motion by earth. This is on itsown axis from west to east which makes it appear that the sun, the planets and stars appear to move from east to west. For this he

has given the example of a person traveling in a boat in a river. Forhim the trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction.
