I was reading a chapter on samaasa and came across the following  
shloka  
a) Can someone please help me get its anvaya and meaning  
b) If possible can you help me get the source of this shloka (is it  
from Siddhant Kaumudi or any authoritative sanskrit grammar book?)  
  
dvandau dvigurapi chAha madgehe nityamavyayeebhaava  
tatpuruSha karmadhaaraya yenaahaM syambahuvreehi  
  
Also, I am new to this group, so could the moderators show me how to  
post directly in devanagari script?
