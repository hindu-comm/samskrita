I had seen both the experts discussing each other superior to other, especially learning अष्टाध्यायी with commentaries is the means to acquire the theories of Grammar and the other method प्रक्रिया method is not so helpful as अष्टाध्यायी. I can see the commentary न्यास supplying the प्रक्रिया lost in between the सूत्र-s like the अनुवृत्ति-s lacking in प्रक्रिया method.

  

Both methods have their own draw backs and merits. But only the thing is a constant practice will make a good grammarian following either of the methods. Otherwise, half way practice will end up as Murthy is afraid of. A proportionate combination of both the methods is desirable to achieve at least introduction to preliminary grammar.

  

I can quote the opinion of युधिष्ठिर मीमांसक I have read in his history of Sanskrit Grammar that the study of अष्टाध्यायी with/without its commentary was meant for a time, when the whole of अष्टाध्यायी could be learnt by heart and then while learning each in order, the relevant सूत्र for deriving at the examples is to be supplied from memory so that the examples are completely understood. It is in the 12th Century that रूपावतार of धर्मकीर्ति a Buddhist theoretician, paved the way for प्रक्रिया method as the Buddhist writers didn't need the सूत्र-s related to छन्दस् and the वैदिकस्वर-s which form a considerable part in the body of अष्टाध्यायी text and it continued up to प्रक्रियासर्वस्व of Melputtur Narayana Bhatta, contemporarily with सिद्धान्तकौमुदी and its commentaries and sub commentaries which fulfilled the need of वैदिकप्रक्रिया covering the whole of the सूत्र-s. This is the real state of things. रूपावतार was followed by प्रक्रियाकौमुदी of रामचन्द्र(११०० ई॰) almost contemporary with धर्मकीर्ति in India. So Bhattoji Dikshit was not only the inventor of प्रक्रिया method. Bhattoji Dikshit himself has written a वृत्ति on the अष्टाध्यायी which is studies who follow the प्रक्रिया method and not the अष्टाध्यायी alone. नागेशभट्ट who wrote commentaries on both महाभाष्य the popular commentary on अष्टाध्यायी and its commentary उद्योत, before काशिका and many other वृत्ति-s and also on the प्रक्रियाग्रन्थ सिद्धान्तकौमुदी and its commentary प्रौढमनोरमा by भट्टोजी himself and independent commentary on सिद्धान्तकौमुदी also. He is said to have learnt महाभाष्य 27 times before trying to write commentaries in both the methods. This shows deep study is needed in following either of the methods if the intention is to master व्याकरण of पाणिनि (note I have not used the word अष्टाध्यायी which is the only theory part of व्याकरण).

  

And this method is followed better when one can learn by heart whole of अष्टाध्यायी from the beginning which was started early in 10th century in spite of the fact that न्यास (६५० AD) supplies प्रक्रिया to fully understand the examples in काशिका while हरदत्त does not do this, following the expositions in महाभाष्य. In both the methods, the target final goal is the study of महाभाष्य which only few of the great scholars are able to complete the study.

  

And, there is no question of overlapping each other methods and everybody is free to choose his own method which need not be discussed as of any public interest as they themselves enjoy the advantage/disadvantages of each method exclusively.
