Ajitji has hit the nail on its head.

I am reminded of the well known quote:

अधीते तु महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी ।

अनधीते महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी॥

For the techies and geeks it has become a fashion to study Panini as he has utilized some basic principles of programming languages and as he is hailed as the originator of Computer programmimg. Backus-Naur form is often called Panini-Backus form.

As Ajitji put it Panini is only for those who have attained a certain standard in Sanskrit and who want to specialize in Sanskrit grammar.

Of course views differ in this matter.

Murthy
