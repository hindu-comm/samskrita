Maybe this is why not many people learn Sanskrit in modern times because  
they mug up word endings without even knowing the most basic concept  
such as a pratayahaar.  
Since the modern method removes the rationale and background, it is  
quite suboptimal.  
I am indeed learning via graded levels of the Astadhyayi - namely the  
various levels in the Kaumudi group.  
And having tried learning the modern way, it is my opinion that the  
modern way is a waste of time.
