Dear Narayanam Mahodaya

I can see you are feeling very strongly about this. No-body will dispute anything you have said below. I hesitate to get into this topic but the issue is whether PANinI is suitable for the student **who has no knowledge of Sanskrit grammar but wants to start learning** - **i.e. the beginner**. Such a student needs something much more simple and much easier to understand. PANinI, in my humble opinion, is for the student who already has some understanding of the basics. It is a second order text. It is like starting a child who want to learn maths with differential equations instead of simple arithmetic. This is no criticism of pANinI - only the level at which a beginner starts learning.

My myself learnt the Western way and then only started to look at pANinI. Even so I find pANini difficult.

I hope you understand that I am actually agreeing with you about the benefits of PANinI.

Vimala

Much has been discussed in this thread about the worthiness of learning aSTAdhyAyI for learning Sanskrit grammar. Let me present some salient points in this matter.
