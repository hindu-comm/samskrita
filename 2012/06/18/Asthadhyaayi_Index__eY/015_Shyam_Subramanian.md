Dear Ajit-ji,Murthy-ji,  

  
\> The question is not about encouraging or discouraging the question is about  
\> relevance, technical competence, time and effort that one has.  
\>  
  

1\. If there is a traditional pre-requisite for studying the sUtra-s  
(ashTAdhyAyI/siddhAnta-kaumudI/laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudI)? Something  
like the shama-damAdi pre-requisites for advaita-vedAnta. However, I think  
you are not talking about that since you are referring to "modern methods".  
  
2. Who is to decide on the technical competence ? Presumably, the person  
trying to study the ashTAdhyAyI/siddhAnta-kaumudI/laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudI  
or his guru, if he is studying them under a teacher. It is clearly not anybody  
else's business, no? The ashTAdhyAyI is surely a valid point of discussion  
in this list and can be ignored by those not interested in it.  

  
\> An analogy i would be If one wants to understand how Universe originated one  
\> can watch a popular TV program or read a popular book one need not  
\> understand Quantum mechanics it equations or advanced theoretical physics.  
\>  
  

3\. On the other hand, it is my personal opinion, based on personal experience,  
that what can be got from a "popular TV program" can be used for  
"showing off", at best.  
Understanding comes only from studying it properly. What is required is not an  
advanced degree in theoretical physics (though it certainly helps) but  
the interest+ability+time to learn the  
mathematical apparatus.  

  
\> Astadhyayi is equivalent to advanced post graduate mathematics thought at a  
\> Masters course and is definitely not meant for undergraduates unless one is  
\> well equipped to understand advanced grammar it will prove to be useless for  
\> non specialist. Who says Astadhyayi cannot be reinterpreted all the best if  
\> possible.This is my sincere opinion. History is the proof for this not  
\> individuals like me!!!!  
  

\> For the techies and geeks it has become a fashion to study Panini as he has  
\> utilized some basic principles of programming languages and as he is hailed  
\> as the originator of Computer programmimg. Backus-Naur form is often called  
\> Panini-Backus form.  
\> As Ajitji put it Panini is only for those who have attained a certain  
\> standard in Sanskrit and who want to specialize in Sanskrit grammar.  

\> Of course views differ in this matter.  
  

4\. A high-school student, who has been exposed to the concept of a  
proof/derivation in mathematics will be able to appreciate and get  
interested in deriving the vibhakti tables from the sUtra-s, if only  
he is exposed to it properly. To clarify, I am not saying that any  
high-school student will be able to learn the ashTAdhyAyI - he/she may  
or may not. I am only saying that the process of derivation of results  
from the sUtra-s is similar to that of deriving theorems from  
axioms.It does not require one to read programming languages or  
whatever forms to get interested in the ashTAdhyAyI.  
  
5. I think, and I like to think many will agree, that after seeing the  
derivation of different subanta-s (ramaH,ramau,ramAH..) from  
"svau-jasam-auT..." (ashTAdhyAyI 4.1.2), there is no question of  
comparison of memorizing tables to memorizing sUtra-s - I will just  
not go back to memorizing tables. Yes, there are 4000 sUtra-s, but I  
can choose what I want to learn using, for example, the kaumudIs. May  
be I will be slow, based on the time I have, but that is my call to  
take.  
  
6. Thanks to both of you, I realized that I need to learn faster,  
since learning the ashTAdhyAyI has become the fashion of the day and I  
can possibly become "fashionable" in at-least some thing (maybe  
Infosys-training will have samskRta-bhAratI type courses? :-)). But  
more seriously, in modern India, anybody interested in samskRta is  
probably already  
branded a "geek", so why this antagonism to people interested in  
ashTAdhyAyI only?  
  
Regards,  
Shyam
