Dear Murthy-ji,  

  
\> Just as we do not start summing up an infinite series to obtain the  
\> logarithm of a number and we read through the log tables, we do not generate  
\> an inflexion using Panini sutras and we invariably use tables learnt by  
\> heart. I am not aware of any Samskrit scholar who derives every inflexion he  
\> uses in his composition based on Panini. Just as knowledge that logarithms  
  

1\. The saMskRta scholar, or a person extremely familiar with saMskRta  
certainly does not derive every case-ending from the ashTAdhyAyI - but  
neither does he refer to the case-ending tables nor does he conjure up the  
table in his head. With practice, the usage has just become second-nature  
to him. By the way, traditional scholars still (or at least till  
recently) use the siddhAnta  
-kaumudI ( <http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part7/chap2.htm> ).  
  
2. This experience would be obvious to even a beginner who has gone through a  
saMskRta-bhAratI-type shibira, for example; you would not pause while  
speaking and count "rAmaH rAmau rAmAH..". If some person has learnt or  
knows saMskRta like a mother tongue, my praNAms to him/her - my comments  
do not apply to him/her. However, if one is in the process of memorizing tables,  
I think there is a strong case for learning it through the sUtra-s.  
  
3. Let us take some analogies for this: A graduate real analysis course  
would use results from a undergraduate real analysis course  
left-right-and centre;  
you would not go about proving everything back to the axioms of real numbers.  
However, the graduate student would certainly not say that the  
undergraduate course is useless.  
Just because you have joined college you would not say that the 10th  
standard book is  
useless \*for everybody\* !!! In advaita-vedAnta, the veda leads you to  
brahma-j\~nAna;  
after that it is of no use to the brahma-j\~nAnI; but that does not mean that  
it is useless for the lay sAdhaka. If it is true of the veda, it is  
certainly true, in this case,  
for the "vedAnAM veda" i.e., vyAkaraNa.  

  
\> uses in his composition based on Panini. Just as knowledge that logarithms  
\> can be obtained through summing a series helps in the understanding of  
\> logarithms, knowing Panini helps in appreciating the grandeur of Panini's  
\> artificial construct.  
  

4\. Nobody is denying that pANini's construct is artificial and that  
the final forms  
in the language is what matters finally - not sure, but I believe  
pata\~njali says so  
in the mahAbhAshyam. That does not mean that his construct is of no use to  
the learner of saMskRta except for "appreciating pANini". Similarly  
(anticipating  
a question here), just because there are multiple vyAkaraNa varieties  
(indram, chandram etc),  
it does not mean that any or all of them are junk or that some variety  
is the best.  
Just because there are multiple roads to a destination, you would not  
say that all the roads  
are useless or that there is no "best" road.  
  
5. Let us take some numbers. In the laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudI ajanta prakaraNams (  
declensions of all the vowel-ending puMli\~Nga,strIli\~Nga, napuMsaka  
li\~Nga words)  
, there are around 120-130 "prAtipadika"-s whose inflexions are being  
derived (I am not  
counting the cases where the case-endings are identical) using roughly the same  
number of sUtras. So, in essence, you are deriving \~130\*8\*3  
case-endings using 130  
sUtra-s (I am including sambodhana). Even accounting for the fact that  
there will be  
significant common case-endings (the dvi-vacana, for example) and  
accounting for  
anuvRtti i.e., more sUtra-s to learn if you are using the ashTAdhyAyI  
straight away,  
this is a big advantage to be had in learning through sUtra-s.In  
addition, you get to use your  
"analytical side" - your left-brain more along the way.  
  
Regards,  
Shyam
