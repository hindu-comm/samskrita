I don't know for sure except for the comment by the kAnchI-paramAchAryAH.  
Maybe somebody in the list who has learn saMskRta traditionally can comment  
on it or on your thesis that pANini is useless for anybody but the expert.

1\. I have read somewhere that bhattoji-dIkshita says that we should have the  
AA ka\~nThastha before going into the SK . Unfortunately, I am not  
able to get the reference though (I agree it is not followed in practice).  
Anyways, the SK still uses all the AA sUtra-s, excepting the order  
is changed (This destroys the anuvRtti-s, hence the commentary is needed)  
  
He salutes pANini in the beginning of the SK and also wrote a  
commentary on the AA  
- the shabda-kaustubha. All this seems like a overtly friendly way of  
giving a "go by".  
  
Even in the beginning of the LSK, varadarAja dIkshita writes:  
  
natvA sarasvatIM devIM SuddhAM guNyAM karomyaham \|  
pANinIya praveSAya laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudIm \|\|  
  
Note that he says "pANinIya praveSAya" - to enter into whatever  
is pANini-kRta; the foremost of which is the AA. It is  
interesting that he does not intend it as a passageway to the SK  
directly.  
  
In conclusion, I think that both bhattoji dIkshita (and varadarAja dIkshita)  
did not intend the ashTAdhyAyI to be given up.  
  
2. OK, the Arya-samAjists vigorously propagated the study of the AA  
without reference to the SK, though there were others also who stressed this.  
So what? If it is worth it, what is wrong in learning it, given that the AA  
itself is pretty old.

3\. bhImasena SAstrI, the author of a 6-volume vyAkhyA on the LSK, says  
that his bhaimI vyAkhyA will benefit all levels of students. SrI gopAla SAstrI  
"darSanakeSarI" in his edition of the ashTAdhyAyI asks the students to  
first memorize the AA or a smaller version 'RjupANinIyam' before understanding  
the sUtrArtha (he describes in detail how to do it). However, I do  
agree that different teachers require from nothing to basic spoken saMskRta  
before teaching the sUtras (LSK/SK/AA) and is best left to the student+teacher.

Thanks for not discouraging :-).  

  
\> If a learner of Sanskrit wants to learn through Panini I am afraid  
\> there is a possibility of his learning neither Panini nor Sanskrit.  
\>  
  

No discouragement, right ? Your concern notwithstanding, I think  
there are enough examples of people who have learnt vyAkaraNa  
through pANini or the kaumudI-s.  
  
In conclusion, my personal opinion is (I am no expert, but a  
student of vyAkaraNA) that if a student has interest+ability+  
time and a great assisting book, especially a good teacher - then he  
should just go for learning through the LSK/SK/AA.
