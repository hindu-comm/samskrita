Nityanandaji,

Thanks for your encouragement. I am in the process of memorizing astadhyaayi too. If you have some time can you please tell me the methods you use to memorize? I repeat each sutra 2 times.

Yes I am not typing the sutras and its simple sanskrit meaning but for coloring I have to manually insert the color. I did not pick any color code for each type of sutra yet.

Initially I thought of creating different colors but than i realized that making everything blue would be a start and once I am done with the document then I can change the colors to make it appear nicely.

  

I manage to learn enough latex to prepare these documents, I used XeTeX so I can directly work with devanagari text, no convertors are required.

  

regards

Raama
