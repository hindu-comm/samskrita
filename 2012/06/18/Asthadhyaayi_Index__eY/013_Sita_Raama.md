Srivalliji,

Thanks for your suggestion.  

Since I am at thebeginningof the document, I would certainly try to add example as well. I myself, wondered if it would be a good idea to do so but the document started to get bigger and bigger.

As I am working on the second chapter, specially in Samasas, I saw myself that an example helps to understand the concept very clearly.

  

regards

Raama
