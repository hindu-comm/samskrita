\> For the techies and geeks it has become a fashion to study Panini as he has utilized some basic principles of programming languages and as he is hailed as the originator of Computer programmimg. Backus-Naur form is often called Panini-Backus form.  
\> As Ajitji put it Panini is only for those who have attained a certain standard in Sanskrit and who want to specialize in Sanskrit grammar.

1\. No "certain standard" is needed if one starts from the most basic  
levels of the kaumudi padathi.  
2. As written in another message, the lower levels of the kaumudi  
suffice for the grammar needed for bhasha.  
3. I repeat - the modern method even chooses to completely ignore the  
utility of something as fundamental as pratayahaaras. That speaks volumes.  
4. AFAIK, there is the kashi ka padathi & there is the modern "ramaha,  
ramau, ramaha" method. Tools and techniques are built on either of these  
paths (correct me if I am mistaken)  
  
Anyway, I have put forth my observations with being frustrated by the  
modern method (for 7 months). And I wanted to share, such that the  
newbies know that the modern way of mugging up -- which is the norm in  
the majority of schools, colleges and universities in India and across  
the world -- is not the best way to learn grammar either for the sake of  
bhasha or for grammar itself.
