As far as my knowledge goes, in the traditional method of learning Sanskrit,  
a student first learns Sabda tables, dhaatu roopa and amarakosha and a few  
sargas of clasical kavya. At the next stage he learns laghusiddhantakaumudi  
and may be later, Siddhantakaumudi. Actually AShtadhyayi was given a go by  
after Bhattojidikshita. It is comparatively recently mainly by Aryasamajists  
that Ashtadhyayi learning was re-introduced.  
All that I say is that one needs to learn by rote Sabda tables,dhatu tables  
at the initial stage and later get a grasp of the derivational aspect  
through LSK or SK. It is only in Sanskrit grammar that derivational aspect  
is exhaustively dealt with. No other language has anything similar to  
Panini, not taking into account possible Panini-clones in Indian languages.  
I do not want to discourage anyone learning Panini. I wish them all the  
best. If a learner of Sanskrit wants to learn through Panini I am afraid  
there is a possibility of his learning neither Panini nor Sanskrit.
