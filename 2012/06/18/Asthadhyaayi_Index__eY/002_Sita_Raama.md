Namaste Nityanandaji,

I am attaching another image of the screen shots taken from C.S. Vasu's book-1. On top of each page Vasu defined a category. I managed to put all of them in a document.

  

But there grey areas are like

1.1.1 वृद्धिरादैच्, 1.1.2 अदेङ्गुणः and 1.1.44 न वेति विभाषा 1.1.21 etc

where I did not know what to write so I left them in one of thecriteriahe defined.

More than anything else I wanted to know if this exercise is fruitful or not. Couple of people liked it in the group, no one discouraged me so far.

I have to take great care in understanding the text to minimize the mistakes. I am reading C.S.Vasu's works and taking notes and these notes are reflected on the pdf I attached in the original mail.

I usedAsTAdhyAyi - Sutra Patha book published by Chaukhabha
SuraBharati publications. Written by Gopaaladatta pAdeyaH to create the actual document where words highlighted blue go the next sutra and the sutra number upto which they travel is shown on the right.

The number in () shows sets of 20 sutras for memorization ease.

  

regards

Raama
