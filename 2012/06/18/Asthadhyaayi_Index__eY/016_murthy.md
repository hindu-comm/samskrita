Just as we do not start summing up an infinite series to obtain the  
logarithm of a number and we read through the log tables, we do not generate  
an inflexion using Panini sutras and we invariably use tables learnt by  
heart. I am not aware of any Samskrit scholar who derives every inflexion he  
uses in his composition based on Panini. Just as knowledge that logarithms  
can be obtained through summing a series helps in the understanding of  
logarithms, knowing Panini helps in appreciating the grandeur of Panini's  
artificial construct.
