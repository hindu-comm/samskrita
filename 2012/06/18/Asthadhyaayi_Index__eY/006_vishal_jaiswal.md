Thank you for the observation. I forgot to add one comment that even if  
one wants to just know that much grammar which is necessary for bhasha  
without specializing in grammar, as far as I know - one can cover the  
laghusiddhantakaumudi for this purpose.  
(I may be wrong, maybe there are further steps - the  
madhyasiddhantakaumudi or the siddhantakaumudi)  
So one need not go all the way up to the astadhayayi to cover the finer  
aspects of grammar. My teacher says this as an example - we accept that  
the value of pi is 3.14 or 22/7 . But we dont go beyond into discussing  
why it is exactly that figure, etc. (maybe this is a poor analogy, but  
serves to illustrate the point)
