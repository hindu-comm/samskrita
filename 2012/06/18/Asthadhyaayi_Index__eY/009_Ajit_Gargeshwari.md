The question is not about encouraging or discouraging the question is about relevance, technical competence, time and effort that one has.  
  
An analogy i would be If one wants to understand how Universe originated one can watch a popular TV program or read a popular book one need not understand Quantum mechanics it equations or advanced theoretical physics.  
  

Astadhyayi is equivalent to advanced post graduate mathematics thought at a Masters course and is definitely not meant for undergraduates unless one is well equipped to understand advanced grammar it will prove to be useless for non specialist. Who says Astadhyayi cannot be reinterpreted all the best if possible.This is my sincere opinion. History is the proof for this not individuals like me!!!!
