Much has been discussed in this thread about the worthiness of learning aSTAdhyAyI for learning Sanskrit grammar. Let me present some salient points in this matter.

  

1\. Though the pANinian method of derivation is said to be artificial, there is no doubt in that pANiniangrammaris accepted as the most authentic one in Sanskrit grammar.

2\. ThepANiniangrammarisbased on aSTAdhyAyi and is aided with vRttis, vArtikas, dhAtupATha, gaNapATha, uNAdisUtra, etc.

3.The texts vyAkaraNa mahAbhASya, siddhAntakaumudI, laghu
siddhAntakaumudI, etc. are also based onaSTAdhyAyI.

4\. When a sUtra fromaSTAdhyAyI is quoted, one needs to know the anuvrtis and adhikAra to get the actual meaning of the sUtra.

5\. The knowledge of the order of the sUtras is also very important especially when apavAda, vipratiSeDha, asiddha , etc are concerned.

6' It always aids in better understanding of the subject if the original text or base of the source is well learnt.

7\. Therefore, while it may not be essential to learnaSTAdhyAyI sUtras in their order for learning Sanskrit grammar, it surely helps in better and clearer understanding of the subject. This is also my personal experience.

8\. Though the methods of learning Sanskrit grammar adopted by the persons differ, the statements like "If a learner of Sanskrit wants to learn through Panini I am afraidthere is a possibility of his learning neither Panini nor Sanskrit" do not seem to be tenable.

9' If at least some of the readers find the work to be useful, the criticism about the worthiness of the same is best avoided.

10\. If there are any mistakes in the work, they should be pointed out. But it is better if we do not criticise any work based on the purely personal view of its usefulness.
