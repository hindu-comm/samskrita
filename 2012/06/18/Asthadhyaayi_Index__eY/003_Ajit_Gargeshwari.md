I don't understand the purpose of this concept. Nobody learns Sanskrit grammar in modern time using Astadhyayi or its translation The text of Grammar is meant for specialists who want to understand grammar completely at the highest level. so in short for a specialist its a waste time and for others its just a passing thought. This is my opinion
