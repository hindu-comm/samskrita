Dear Śrīsītārāma  
  
It is a great effort and I will look forward to its completion. Even if there are few takers among billions of people or even if there is no audience and it is completely Svāntaḥsukhāya (for your own pleasure), it is a commendable task, and I request you to complete it.  
  
I am memorizing the Aṣṭādhyāyī, and I know for a fact I am far from being alone - in fact a person who is memorizing the text blogs under <http://avagraha.wordpress.com/>. Your work is very helpful as a reference and learning aid/resource.  
  
Some suggestions  

1.  For classifying Sūtras with missing classification, you can have a
    shared spreadsheet or something similar with the group members. I
    can help you with missing classes of Pāda 2.1. 2.  Can you please use different colours to indicate different types of
    Sūtra as you did in a previous version (I remember seeing red and
    green). While doing an Āvṛtti from the text (as opposed to an Āvṛtti
    from memory), this would be very useful. 3.  If you are manually typing the text (which I doubt), it might be
    easier to convert the Devnagari Sūtras and Vṛtti available online to
    Velthuis format for your LaTeX input.  

Thanks, Nityānanda
