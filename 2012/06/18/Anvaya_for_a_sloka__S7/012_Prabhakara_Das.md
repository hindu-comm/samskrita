I am not an expert on grammar. I suggest another point of *practice*connected with this verse. The *anja chakra* situated in between the eyebrows have only two petals. The letters there in are *ha & sa.*In *japa, anuswaram* is added. The concept beyond this is, *GURU*sits there and giving *anja*to control us. Thus the term *hamsaabhyaam*is justified. And *parivruththapathrakamalai*can be justified when an *OM* visualised as a covering factor. I write this from my practice, which was advised by my GURU.
