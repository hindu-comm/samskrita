Nityanandji,

  

Thank you for offering to translate the commentary on Gurudhyanam later. I sincerely hope you will get an opportunity to discuss the grammar of this dhyanasloka with your revered Guru.

  

I have mp3 of the complete chanting of Guru Gita by Swami Muktananda which I had received from a friend. It is very melodious though he sings in his own style.



regards  
shankara
