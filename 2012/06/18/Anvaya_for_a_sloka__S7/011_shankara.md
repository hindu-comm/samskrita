Nityanandji,

  

This is a pleasant surprise (gift) on the Guru Poornima day. Thank you very much for providing Sanskrit commentary on this verse by your revered Guru. I understand it to certain extent. Still, it would be helpful if you could translate it into English when you find time.

  

One more doubt - Is "हंसाभ्यां परिवृत्तपत्रकमलैः" to be read together? Is it a samasa? I understood your explanation of the परिवृत्तपत्रकमलैः. As I understand it from the commentary "हंसाभ्यां परिवृत्तपत्रकमलैः" means " By those whose lotus like hearts are surrounded by Brahma and Jiva". Is this correct?  



regards  
shankara
