Shankara Ji  
  
Glad you liked it, I will try to translate into English some time in future. I still do not know if हंसाभ्यां परिवृत्तपत्रकमलैः is a Samāsa or not. I do remember Gurudeva remarking that the verse has some unusual usage when it comes to grammar, and I will ask him when I next get the chance.  
  
Meanwhile the attached mp3 is a 70-second audio clip from the recording of the Guru Gītā sung by Muktānanda Paramahaṃsa of Gaṇeśapurī in Maharashtra. I do not know when it was recorded, but from the voice I guess it is at least 40-50 years ago. He is accompanied by a solitary string instrument (and not percussion instrument as I wrote earlier) which is probably the Ektara. After the Viniyoga, the Guru sings this verse. He does not seem to care too much for the Yatis (ceasura) and Pada boundaries of the Śārdūlavikrīḍita metre and sings in his own style, stopping when he wants to (Avadhūta prosody anyone?). Hope you enjoy it.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
