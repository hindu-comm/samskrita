Here is the earlier link replied by our senior member Sunder:

Now (atha) , meditation (dhyānam) \|

  

The Independent (svacchandam) , according to His own Will (Atma-icchayā) , is widespread or pervasive (utkīrṇam) (as) the universe (Visva) through the causes (kāraṇaiḥ) World (jagat) , residing (nilayaiḥ) in many (aneka) body (deha) , (in other words) through the divine (divyaiḥ) lotus petals (patra-kamalaiḥ) surrounded (Parivrtta) by Ham and Sa (haṁsābhyām) \|

One should meditate (dhyayet) that (tad) Light (dyotam) that (is) the condition (pada) of Sambhu - Shiva - (śāmbhavam) certainly (you) . (It should also be meditating) in support (caraṇam) that holds (grāhiṇam) the flame (aṅkura) Light (previously mentioned) (DIPA) , which is a form (vigraham) visible (pratyakṣa) of (all) syllables (akṣara) . (In short, one should meditate) in all-pervading (vibhum) ( e) Eternal (śāśvatam) state or condition (padam) of the Guru (Guru) \| \|



I got this from some other site with Google English translation of the page.

  

Mr. Sunder had given his translation.

  

I do not have any idea of the ideology behind the verse.

  

परिवृत्तपत्त्रकमलैः

is related to हंसाभ्याम्

which means the petals of the lotus turned round (, revolved , rolling , moving to and fro) with the हं and सःletters i.e. सोऽहं \> हंसः - seems to be the idea of each petal, of the lotus in the form of the जगत्कारण the effective cause of the creation of the world. The पदशांभवं is shown by gurucaraNa.

  

दीपाङ्कुरग्राहिणं is an adjective to a masculine noun, which is विभुं which refers to शिव by context. The image of शिव in the form of गुरु seems to be depicted here in this verse. I have no idea of this picture holding flame of lamp.

  

  

Sorry for the helplessness.
