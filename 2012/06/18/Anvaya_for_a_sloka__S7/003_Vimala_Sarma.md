Shankara Mahodaya

It is not patrakamalai but patrakamalair in the sloka - please see below. The visarga has been replaced with r in sandhi.

I am not sure about so'ham being hamsa. Is this correct? Could also be
"through the cause of the world and by revolving petals of the lotus flanked by two swans" . Swan represents wisdom.
