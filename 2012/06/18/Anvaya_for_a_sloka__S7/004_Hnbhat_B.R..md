It is already correctly spelt there in the originally quoted verse.

I could not see why two swans only represent wisdom and not more or single swan would do. The total picture is not clear in the description without the back ground of the theology or ideological representation of the words in the verse. Grammatical analysis won't gain much in my opinion. Hence I gave it up half way.

  

Anybody can try a satisfactory explanation with authentic sources to support their views. As it is, there many missing links for a proper अन्वय to put the whole in a syntactical order satisfactorily, though attempts are made to translate in earlier posts without any source to support or grammatical support the translations.
