Bhat Sir,

  

Thank you very much for the explanation. I have a few more questions.  

1. In the sloka, 'परिवृत्त' is in samasa with पत्रकमलै. Can परिवृत्त be treated as related to हंसाभ्यां?

2. Is the word पत्रकमलै grammatically correct? Shouldn't it be कमलपत्रैः?  

3\. Do you think there could be grammatical errors in this sloka?  
  

regards  
shankara
