If the words are given correctly, it will not be a difficulty to get  
the word meaning. One could check with the original and find the exact  
meaning at least if reference is given.

In the last predication,

अमुं मुनिवर्यं मुदं वितेने - means made this great sage happy.

मोदते इति मुदः - "इगुपधज्ञाप्रीकिरः कः" (3-1-135 ) - one who pleases, enjoys.  
The reason for this is touching his holy nails of feet with his crest  
jewels i.e. prostrating at his feet.

On the whole, it can be translated as he propitiated the great sage by  
prostrating at his feet as his crest jewels rubbed against them.  
Beautiful description.
