Thanks for the verse in original. I found the words quoted are not correct as given by P Ramakrishnan.

  

कविताकुशलोऽथ केरलक्ष्माकमन: कश्चन राजशेखराख्य: /

मुनिवर्यममुं मुदं वितेने निजकौटीरनिघृष्टपन्नखाग्र्यः //  

  

Once the correct version is given, it is not at all difficult to arrive at word meanings. Otherwise it will be beating around the bush. Here is the word by word translation.

  

  

कविताकुशलोऽ

  

अथ - once upon a time,

केरलक्ष्माकमन: कश्चन - a king of Kerala land (क्ष्मा), literally the lover (कमनः - रञ्जकः), the husband of the earth,

राजशेखराख्य: - named Rajashekhara,

मुनिवर्यममुं = अमुं = this, मुनिवर्यम् - great sage,

निजकौटीरनिघृष्टपन्नखाग्र्यम् - having clashed tips his nails of feet with his crest jewel'

निजैः - his own, कौटीरैः - crest jewels, निघृष्टः - mingled with, clashed, पादयोः नखाग्र्याः - the holy nails of feet (of the sage),

मुदं वितेने  - made him happy.

  

The last part of the sentence is difficult to explain in grammatical terms. Still there seems to be some error in the reading. The commentator has corrected to some extent by changing the phrase into accusativeनिजकौटीरनिघृष्टपन्नखाग्र्यम्. But could not explain अमुं - मुनिम्, मुदं वितेने - which is difficult to explain though it can be translated as made him happy by prostrating at his feet.

  

I hope I have given the word meaning in a way following the commentary.
