It is very simple. युध संप्रहारे in दिवादिगण is अनुदात्तेत् and hence it is expected in आत्मनेपद. In लोट् मध्यमपुरुषैकवचन it should be युध्यस्व. In गीता quoted is used in परस्मैपद as against the ruleअनुदात्तङित*आत्मनेपदम्*(। । १,३.१२ । ।) as युध्य in the same sense, त्वं युध्य. as declined as a परस्मैपद verb.

  

This can be explained, in two ways: The आत्मनेपद prescribed by the above rule, can be optional in certain cases as above, according to the ज्ञापक, "चक्षिङः ख्याञ्" which itself is अनुदात्तेत्, the ङ् अनुबन्ध makes it obligatorily आत्मनेपद. Hence in this case, it is optionally used as परस्मैपद. That is why the commentators are silent on it.वलेरात्मनेपदमनित्यम्, ज्ञापकात्॥ ५..२..३॥ वामन says this as acceptable due to thisज्ञापक.

  

The other way is to explain it as युधम् आत्मन इच्छति - युध्यति - as perसुप आत्मनः क्यच्(॥ ३।१।८) a verb derived from युध् a noun, as a nominal verb by the above सूत्र which is always conjugated as परस्मैपद as युध्यति, युध्यतः युध्यन्ति and here it is no exceptionally against पाणिनि-s rule.

  

This is also explained and accepted as such by वामन -

  

’यो भर्तृपिण्डस्य कृते न युध्येत्’

  

इति प्रयोगः, स चायुक्तः, युधेरात्मनेपदित्वात्।

  

युध्येदिति युधः क्यचि॥ काव्यालंकारसूत्र ५..२..२८॥

  

These two ways are used to justify the परस्मैपद in the archaic text. There are other cases where परस्मैपदि धातु is used as आत्मनेपदि which is difficult to justify as "सत्यमेव जयते" which is not covered by पाणिनि’s rules in अष्टाध्यायी.

  

In both ways the usage can be justified in the above case.
