Namaste to all,

  

I request the learned members of this group to explain the use of the word "युध्य" in मामनुस्मर युध्य च (Srimad Bhagavad Gita 8.7). Sri Sankaracharya, Madhusudana Saraswati and Sreedhara Swami in their commentaries merely explain that युध्य is युध्यस्व. I would like to know if this is a non-Paninian usage or if it is as per Panini's grammar, what is its lakara, pada, purusha, etc.  



regards  
shankara
