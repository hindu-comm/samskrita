In this sutra

स्वरितेनाधिकार: 1.3.11

C.S.Vasu gave following translation (book-1) page 37

  

"In these aphorisma, when a word is marked with a स्वरित accent, by that an अधिकार or a governing rule is to be understood."

  

I was wondering if there is any book out there, that actually marks sutras like described in this sutra.

Because C.S.Vasu later said that "As a rule, sutras are not marked with accents, it is therefore from commentaries that one has to learn wheather a sutra has aस्वरित or not.
