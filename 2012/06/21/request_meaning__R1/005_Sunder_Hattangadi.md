Prof. V. Krishnamurthy wrote a series of articles on Kanchi Paramacharya's discourses on Soundaryalahari. Verse #75 has the following:

"....Shloka #75 says further about the breast milk of ambaa. It generates, says the shloka, everything superlatively noble – like wisdom, compassion, beauty, knowledge, and the arts. “sArasvatam iva”, meaning, everything for which Sarasvati is the source. They all flow like a flood from the heart – “hRdayataH payaH pArAvAraH”. It was that milk of wisdom, Oh Mother, that you fed to that child of the Dramila country. And that child became a noted poet among great composers – “kavInAM prouDhAnAM ajani kamanIyaH kavayitA”.



“prouDha-kavi” means a poet rich with poetic talent. The feminine word “prouDhA” denotes a girl who has attained puberty. Just as the physical tejas attains maturity, a person whose poetic talent has attained perfection and maturity is called a “prouDha-kavi”. Ironically, a “prouDha-kavi” is also prone to be proud! And in the poetry that flows from such a one there is likely to be a mischievous air of superiority. It may not appeal to the heart. But the milk of wisdom, which flows like a flood from this ocean of ‘SArasvata’, generates
poetic inspiration that captivates the heart. By using the words “payaH pArAvAraH parivahati” – the milk ocean flows like a flood – the Acharya has added one more ‘lahari’, namely, the lahari of breast milk that represents all that is great in the Mother, to the various lahari’s mentioned in Soundaryalahari -- cidAnanda-lahari, shRngAra-lahari, etc. When this ‘kshhIra-lahari’ (the flood of milk) is tasted by the dramila-shishu (Tamil child), the latter becomes a poet who composes captivating songs that make him distinguished among even ‘prouDha’
composers!



Now who was this ‘dramila-shishu’? The immediate feeling is that it should be the well-known Sambandar, also known as ‘JnAna-sambandar’ of the Tamil region, who flourished in the seventh century A.D. But the Acharya’s time was in the sixth-fifth century B.C., approximately.



\[ Here the Paramacharya takes for granted

his own elaborate thesis-like discussion

on the date of Shankara,

that runs to hundreds of pages,

in his earlier discourses. These have been recorded

by Ra. Ganapati in the 5th volume of his book

‘Deivathin Kural’. So I am not able to enter into that topic here.

The story about the child JnAna-sambandar is that the Mother Goddess fed her breast milk to the three-year old child and the child burst into ecstatic singing glorifying Lord Shiva and Parvati. Commentators on Soundaryalahari opine that a similar incident did happen in the case of the Acharya himself when he was a child and therefore conclude that the ‘dramila-shishu’ refers to the Acharya himself! Instead of saying ‘I have that experience’ he is saying it in third person, in all modesty. But even here one can ask: How come the Acharya talks about his own poetic talent in such superlative terms? Is this in keeping with his well-known modesty? Well, the point to note here is that the matter is not about poetic talent. The significant point is the glory of the milk of wisdom that flows from ambaal. Actually the Acharya has talked about himself as ‘the farthest of the lowly’ (daviyAmsaM dInaM) in shloka #66. And the significance now is that even such a ‘lowly’ person has reached poetic heights of excellence by the divine milk of wisdom.



On the correct interpretation of ‘dramila-shishu’ there have been controversies from very early times. Several commentators have debated this issue. No definite conclusion has been accepted by all. But let us not stay on that issue. What we need is not the correct meaning of ‘dramila-shishu’ but the truth that we should seek that wisdom that flows incessantly like milk from ambaal’s grace!...."
