I have corrected the meaning with the change in the reading according to the commentaries. The rest needs no change in meaning as you have given.

  

The word द्रविडशिशु referred to in the verse have given to many speculations about the personage.

Lakshmidhara holds it refers to श्रीशङ्कर himself with which Kaivalyasrama agrees and cites an incident from Sankara's life in support of his view. Some consider that it is the incident of St. Thirujnanasambandhar who is alluded to in the above line. According to another version, Dravidasisu, a pious devotee composed them and inscribed them in Kailasa. When Sankara was memorizinng them, the Devi had them erased by the author, but the prodigious Srisankara 41 verses and t which he added remaining 59 verses from his pen.

  

Ramakavi, in his Dindima, observes, "Some say that Siva spoke this stotra, others Sri Sankara, his incarnation and some others say that it came from the great effulgence of the teath of theprimordial Sak8it, Lalitha and there are thus many versions. Pravarasena, a son of the King of Dravida is mentioned in the Sudhavidyotini as its author.

  

Hope this note may be interesting that the authorship of Sankara as the composer these verses is disputed and the commentators themselves disagree among themselves about this due to the above allusion of DraviDasisu.

  

I will quote the original lines from the relevant later if it interests in that they quote different episodes as the origin of the verses.
