Dr. Bhatt - thanks for the meaning given.

  

The assumption that Dravidasisu refers to Sankara himself is not tenable for

it would amount to Sankara praising himself. There is also no tradition around

Kaladi the birth place of Sankara that he was nursed by Parvati as an infant and

became a great poet.But the story of Thurujnanasambandar eminently fits with the meaning of thissloka.

  

I am not entering into a discussion one the word Dravida. I consider that it

means Tamil. Dravida \> dramila \> tamila the language and not the race.

I doubt if 1200 years ago Namputhiris were speaking Tamil.
