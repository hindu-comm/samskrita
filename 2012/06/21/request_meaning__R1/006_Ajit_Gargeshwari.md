Please find extracts from some commentaries on the verse the first is from Saundaryalahri with Lakshimidhara's commentary published by Mysore Oriental Library  
  
The second is from Saundarya Lahari Or The Ocean of Beauty edited by Subramanya Sastri S. & Srinivasa Ayyangar T.R.  

[TABLE]

This is Norman Brown's Translation  
  
The Milk of your Breasts, O daughter of the Mountain, I think is as if from heart there flowed an ocean of the milk of poesy, when the Dravida child tasted this as you gave it to him in compassion, He became the poet laureate of the master poets.
