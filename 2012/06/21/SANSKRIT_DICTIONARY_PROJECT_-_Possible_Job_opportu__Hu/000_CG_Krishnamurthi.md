Priya Suhrudah,  
  
Can people work at this institute as contract staff for digitization work at Pune, as required by the research institute which got funds from Ministry of HRD for digitization - but the ministry is not allowing recruiting of Permanent staff - please read the news item carefully - link below...  
  
I feel we Samskritaanuraginah instead of looking at the hurdles, to look at this as an opportunity which I'm sure we do - though I haven't contacted the institute and done my research, the news item looks interesting and worth a call...  
  
Regards  
CG Krishnamurthi

**\[“That we are now at letter “A” and have reached words starting with “ap” over the last few decades should not come as a surprise. While we are grateful to the HRD Ministry for the funds granted, we urgently need more talented manpower. What must be kept in mind is that no project can match ours in terms of its historical and linguistic wealth,” said Bhatta.
