Respected Scholars,



I would like to be enlightened about the description of Lord Vishnu or Lord Rama as

वनमाली as in Vishnu Sahasranama. Is it that he is fond of flowers from forest, jungle, grove or garden \[pushpavana, udyaana, vrinda vana\]? What are the favourite flowers of Lord Vishnu and of Lord Shiva as per tradition?

I also observe that Saint Thyagaraja in one of his compositions \[Bala kanaka maya\] describes Lord Rama with the words "घन नील नव्य वन मालिकाभरण"



Reverentially

R Subrahmanian
