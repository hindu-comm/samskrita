Kollavarsham



The era starting from 1^(st) Chingam or Simhamasam when the sun enters

the simha rasi (leo in Greek) is named Kollavarsham. Because Kollam

was the capital of the kingdom where it was started. It was in the

Christian Era 825. It was started by Rajasekhara Varma.



Probably it was in honor of Adi Sankaracharya, It is inferred from

the kali-dina-samkhya 1434160 pneumatically written as

आचर्यवागभेद्या. The king of Kollam Rajasekhara Varma wasa patron of Adi Sankara'



The word acharya is used in memory of Adi Sankaracharya who had just

passed away. If that is correct then it coincides with the life span of

Sankaracharya said to be from 788 to 820 A.D



From the following it can be inferred that Adi Sankara was a contemporary

of Rajasekhara. And they were personally known to each other.



Sankara himself has used the word Rajasekhara in his Sivanandlalahari as

given below.



Sivanadalahari Sloka 70



अरहसि रहसि स्वतन्त्र-बुध्या

वरिवसितुं सुलभ: प्रसन्नमूर्ति: /

अगणितफलदायक: प्रभुर्मे

जगदधिको हृदि **राजशॆखरोस्ति /**/



Madhaviya Sankaravijayam gives the story of Sankaracharya meeting Rajasekhara as follows.

Sarga 14 Sloka 171

कविताकुशलोथ केरळक्ष्माकमन: कश्चन **राजशेखराख्य:** /

मुनिवर्यममुं मुदं वितेने निजकौटीरनिघृष्टपन्नखाग्र्य: //



But according to Kanchi Mutt website Sankaracharya lived 2500 years ago.
