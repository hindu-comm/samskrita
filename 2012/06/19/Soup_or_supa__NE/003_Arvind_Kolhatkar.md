Dear Group,

  

The closeness of meaning between the Sanskrit'सूप' and the English 'soup' was noticed by me several decades ago when I came across the verse -

  

यस्य नास्ति निजा प्रज्ञा केवलं तु बहुश्रुत:।

न स जानाति शास्त्रार्थं दर्वी सूपरसानिव॥

  

Till date I have wondered about it but have not come across an answer.
MW says that the Sanskritसूपis of doubtful origin and the origin of the English does not appear to be very old, nor is there any connection between the two etymologies.

  

Or is it a mere coincidence?
