Dear Śrīsītārāma  
  
The words are indeed quite close. And it is not very surprising. As per Etymology Dictionary by Douglas Harper, the etymology of English "soup" is French from Latin from Germanic from Proto-German from Proto-Indo European.  
  
*"liquid food," 1650s, from Fr. soupe "soup, broth," from L.L. suppa "bread soaked in broth," from a Germanic source (cf. M.Du. sop "sop, broth"), from P.Gmc. base \*supp-, from PIE \*sub-, from root \*seue- "to take liquid" (see [sup](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sup&allowed_in_frame=0) (2)). Primordial soup is from a concept first expressed 1929 by J.B.S. Haldane. Soup kitchen is attested from 1839. In Ireland, souper meant "Protestant clergyman seeking to make proselytes by dispensing soup in charity" (1854).  
*  
It is likely that the PIE \*sub- became सूप in Samskrita. The Samskrit word सूप has other meanings too, including a cook and hence सूपशास्त्र (the art of cooking). Monier Williams says doubtful derivation, while Apte counts it it in पृषोदरादिगण explaining as सुखेन पीयते सु + पा + घञर्थे क.
