Being a rainy season is one reason. Ashadha is the " dusk month" of Devas, closing of uttarayana, start of dakshinayana. For Keralites this month is for reading Ramayana, pilgrimage to temples. Where as in Tamizhu nadu the prefer to buy gold as they say aadiponuu aadi valarum ie gold savings will increase if got in Ashada. TN people are also performin some temple rituals only on this month.
