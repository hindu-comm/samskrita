One can Read History of Dharmashastras by P.V. Kane to get an encyclopedic view on the question asked all the volumes are available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). A detailed discussion on Maasa and Tithis why certain time is considered auspicious or in-auspicious will divert the groups attention to astrology and related sciences. I don't know how many would be interested in such discussions
