Used from the Vedic times Vastu Shastra enjoyed a revival since the 1960s. Vaastu sasthra, means the science of the built area. It ancient Indian architectural science. This science claims to be in tune with the natural law, lays down rules to create ideal conditions for living by connecting individual life with cosmic life.

  

The art of Vastu originates in the Stapatya Veda, a part of the Atharva Veda. It used to be a purely technical subject and it was only confined to architects (Sthapatis) and handed over to their heirs. The principles of construction, architecture, sculpture etc., as enunciated in the epics and treatise on temple architecture, have been incorporated in the science of Vastu.

  

Our tradition mentions Maya and Vishwakarma as great architects. Matsyapurana mentions the names of 18 sages who are said to have established the science of Vastu. The sages are Bhrigu,Nagnajit, Shaunak, Atri, Vishalaksha, Garg, Vashishtha, Purandara, Vasudev, Vishwakarma, Bramha, Aniruddha, Maya, Kumara, Shukra, Narad, Nandisha,Brihaspati.

  

There are more than 60-70 classical Sanskrit texts that dealt with the subject of vaastu, as well as scores of local texts in the various Indian languages. There are many practices which remained unrecorded but were handed down as skills from father to son. This included the preparation of materials such as bricks and lime, the dressing of stone, the preparation of timber, the bonding and joining of various materials and curing of surfaces.  

  

The following are some of the important ancient works ofVastu Shastra:

Vishwakarma Vastu Shastra, Samarangana Sutradhar, Mandana Sutradhar, Rajasirnha Vastu, Deeparnava, Shilparatna, Mayamata, Manasara, Manushyalaya Chandrika, Kashyapa Shilpa, Aparajita Pricha, Vishwakarma Prakash , Sanatkumara Vastu Shastra.

Manasara Silpa Shastra (by Manasara), Mayamatam (by the Mayasuras),Iswakarma Vaastushastra (by Viswakarma), Samarangana Sutradara (by Raja Bhoja), Aparajita Priccha (a dialogue between Viswakarma and his son Aparajita, written by Bhuvanadevacharya) Silparatna.

  

  

References to Vastu Shastra are also found in the following Agamic and Pauranic literature:

Karnikagama, Vaikhanasagama, Agni Purana, Vishnudharmottar Purana, Bhavishya Purana, Suprabhedagama, Hayasirsha Tantra, Matsya Purana, Bramhanda Purana.

  

Jyotis-Vastu, Silpa Ratna, Manasara,Vastu Pradeepa, Viswa Karma's Vastu Shastra,Kasyapa Samhita, Maya Samhita

Bhrugu Samhita etc.

  

Many of the book mentioned above have been edited and published.

The principles of construction, architecture, sculpture etc., as enunciated in the epics and treatise on temple architecture, have been incorporated in the science of Vastu.

  

Mayamatam and Vastu Prakash have been found to be the best. Mayamatam was edited by the hierarchy of Architects known as the Mayasuras while Vastu Prakash was edited by the mythical architect, Acharya Vishwakarma.

  

Though, Vastu Prakash is a notable Text, it is an individual’s concept and has it’s limitations whereas the Mayamatam is a hierarchy which originated from the Ramayan era to the Mahabharat era and beyond. Therefore, Mayamatam evolved over the centuries and is considered the most relevant today.

  

It is interesting to note that Jyotisha is divided into 5 parts Siddhanta, Muhurtha, Jatka, Prasna and Vastu.  

  

Vastu Shastra therefore is a strong and a well established tradition of Architecture which is rich with philosophy, legacy, ancient texts, and a sacred commitment to create each home as an abode of God.
