The question is equal in the case of Veda-s also even if the roots are traced to Vedic Literature:

  

अग्निहोत्रं त्रयो वेदास्त्रिदण्डं भस्मगुण्ठनम्‌ ।

बुद्धिपौरुषहीनानां जीविका धातृनिर्मिता ॥२॥

  

त्रयो वेदस्य कर्तारो भण्डधूर्तनिशाचराः ।

जर्भरीतुर्फरीत्यादि पण्डितानां वचः स्मृतम्‌ ॥१०॥

  

Long ago raised by the Intellectual Teacher बृहस्पति to teach चार्वाक materialist school.

Mr. Sunder had taken pains to show the roots in Vedic Literature.

Now the question may be focused on whether the so called वास्तुविज्ञान or शिल्पशास्त्र the technical Indian Science of Architecture is to be associated with religious beliefs or not. Here lies the precise answer to the question. Whether it is compatible with modern architecture or not is a different question and the religious benefits ascribed to it goes with the so called benefits of Vedic mantra-s too equal as ascertained in the lines above.

  

A similar discussion was popping up in many ways in another group of scholars, as to whether शब्द in the Indian Philosophy of Language, is नित्य and the correct usage of words ascribed to the  physical sounds of speech is applicable to all other speeches of humankind. To sum up,

  

अनादिनिधनं ब्रह्म शब्दतत्त्वं यदक्षरम्।

विवर्ततेऽर्थभावेन प्रक्रिया जगतो यथा॥  
  

is the philosophy of language propounded by भर्तृहरि, and the question immediately raised the "एकः शब्दः सुष्ठु प्रयुक्तः स्वर्गे लोके कामधुग् भवति" is limited to Sanskrit words only or applicable to the words in any language of the humankind.

Why Sanskrit words only deserve the merits of mantra-s? than other words in other languages?

This is my sincere opinion.
