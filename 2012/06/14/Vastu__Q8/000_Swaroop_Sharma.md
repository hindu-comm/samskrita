Dears,

Namaste,

I am curious to know the root of the word **vAstu**. I am aware of the **vAstu-puruSha****homa,** conducted a day before the house warming ceremony. I can also chant the mantra of **vAstu-puruSha**, but what I am yet to decipher is, its Vedic roots and etymology. Are there authentic scriptures written by scholars about **vAstu**or is it a contribution of the self claimed **vAstu-GYAnIs** and **vAstu-vishaaradas?**Isn't it ironically amazing to know that country filled with Kubera-corners is still Developing Nation (Financially) and many countries which are not exposed to such ideas are financially well off! If anybody can provide with reference the meaning of the **vAstu-puruShamantra,** I would be very happy :-)

Dhanyavad
