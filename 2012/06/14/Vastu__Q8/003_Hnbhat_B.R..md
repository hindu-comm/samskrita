As for the derivation of the word वास्तोष्पति I have attached a pdf file extract from the definition from शब्दकल्पद्रुम. It refers to Indra generally and there we can found specific description of the वास्तुपुरुष in the related literature with different parts of the house identified in the body of वास्तुपुरुष. Whether both could be identified or not is again would give rise a heated discussion.

  

The grammatical etymology for the word वास्तु is as follows: वसन्ति प्राणिनो यत्र - "वसेरगारे णिच्च" (उणादि १.७०) from the root वस निवासे (to live) with the suffix तु strictly in the sense the dwelling place or house (अगार) which is extended to apply to the site also for building the house.
