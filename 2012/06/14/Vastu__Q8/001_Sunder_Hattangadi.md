Rig Veda, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at [sacred-texts.com](http://sacred-texts.com)



HYMN LIV. Vastospati.



1\. ACKNOWLEDGE us, O Guardian of the Homestead: bring no disease, and give us happy entrance.  
Whate’er we ask of thee, be pleased to grant it, and prosper thou quadrupeds and bipeds.



2 Protector of the Home, be our promoter: increase our wealth in kine and steeds, O Indu.  
May we be ever-youthful in thy friendship: be pleased in us as in his sons a father.



``3 Through thy dear fellowship that bringeth welfare, may we be victors, Guardian of the Dwelling!  
Protect our happiness in rest and labour. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
