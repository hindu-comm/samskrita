The above extract is the basis for the use of the phrase व्याजवृत्त्या in spite of his defending his own action as धर्म. The verses quoted in the subsequent chapters, do not indicate any direct fighting or द्वन्द्वयुद्ध as suggested by Mr.Nityananda Mishra. It only indicates that the duel fight between सुग्रीव and वालिन् used mountains and trees also, which were smashed by the arrow thrown in between. As there is no indication of direct fighting here in the chapter related to the episode.

  

अन्तको रामरूपेण explains everything, it was the fate of Valin to die like an animal than deserved by the status of a valorous hero probably equal to strength, Rama. Ravana defeated earlier by Valin and कार्तवीर्य defeated by Ravana, and also the same done by Parasurama.

  

The same with the abandonment of Sita, Even at the accusation by a layman, सीता was abandoned by सीता depicts his as a king loyal to his subjects, by not ignoring his opinion. Yet, श्रीराम was hesitating as a husband in the above instance. Further it can be seen in this case also, as a warrior, whether he should interfere in the द्वन्द्वयुद्ध or not, which is against धर्मयुद्ध. It is this aspect highlighted by the poet Bhattathiri and many other poets in their works, like Uttararamacarita etc.

  

In both cases, one can defend Rama's action as रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः which makes him beyond any objections.

  

This is my sincere opinion.
