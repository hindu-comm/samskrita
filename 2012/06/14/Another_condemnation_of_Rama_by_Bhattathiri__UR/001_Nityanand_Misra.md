Dear P. K. Ramakrishnan Mahodaya  
  
It's easy to jump to such conclusions, but it may be far from the विवक्षा of the poet. It is very unlikely that in a work full of Bhakti like नारायणीयम्, the poet would "censure" or "criticize" his इष्ट. It is more likely to be व्याजस्तुति (व्याजस्तुतिर्मुखे निन्दा स्तुतिर्वा रूढिरन्यथा - similar to "irony"), a figure of speech in which there is apparent criticism or praise while the intent and meaning are opposite. It would be better to consult what traditional commentaries (भक्तरञ्जिनी) or the Gurus of the relevant Sampradaya have to say on this. If you ask me, I would interpret वयाजवृत्ति as अवतारलीला, with the व्याज being the human-like actions of the Supreme Brahman, hidden from the common folk but known only to the likes of Valmiki, Vyasa, et cetera.  
  
About killing of वालिन्, some traditions narrate that वालिन् was slayed in a face-to-face war with श्रीराम. Notable are the verses 4.19.11 and 4.19.12 of वाल्मीकिरामायणम् -  
  
अन्तको रामरूपेण हत्वा नयति वालिनम्  
क्षिप्तान्वृक्षान्समाविध्य विपुलाश्च तथा शिलाः  
वाली वज्रसमैर्बाणैर्वज्रेणेव निपातितः -  
  
"After cutting down the many trees and large rocks thrown \[at him by वालिन्\], श्रीराम killed वालिन्, with arrows like वज्र, as if the mountains were felled by Indra's वज्र.  
  
Also, श्रीराम tells वालिन् - "सूक्ष्मः परमदुर्ज्ञेयः सतां धर्मः प्लवङ्गम". You may refer canto 18 (especially 4.18.11, 4.18.15, 4.18.20, 4.18.22-23, 4.8.30-33, 4.18.40, 4.18.61-62) of किष्किन्धाकाण्डम् in वाल्मीकिरामायणम् for the conversation between वालिन् and श्रीराम - वालिन् himself criticizes श्रीराम for killing him, and after listening to श्रीराम, he is convinced that the killing upheld the Dharma - it was a punishment for the sin of appropriating the wife of सुग्रीव and this punishment freed वालिन् of the Karmic bondage (4.18.61) and the unpardonable sin of appropriating his younger brother's wife (4.18.62). Moreover, the punishment was in accordance with the Dharma as enunciated by Manu (4.18.30-32) and similar to what was carried out by मान्धाता in old days (4.18.33).  
  
Regards, Nityanand
