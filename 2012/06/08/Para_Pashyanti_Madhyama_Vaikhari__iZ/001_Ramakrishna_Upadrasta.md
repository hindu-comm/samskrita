namaste,  
  
This is a very short reply and I think the main problem is that an  
English translation is being searched for. Anyway, you could refer to  
sAyana-bhAShya of the asya-vAmIya-mantra 1.164.45 linked from here:

Reading the above along with the many explanations over there could  
answer your question.  
  
Also, I do remember reading a good translation of the above  
sAyana-bhAShya in a work of Shri Kapali Sastry, which was part of his  
collected works. You could refer that. (I do not remember in which it  
was). Hope this helps.  
  
namaste  
Ramakrishna
