2012/6/8 Ramakrishna Upadrasta \<[uramak...@gmail.com]()\>:  

\> Also, I do remember reading a good translation of the above  
\> sAyana-bhAShya in a work of Shri Kapali Sastry, which was part of his  
\> collected works. You could refer that. (I do not remember in which it  
\> was). Hope this helps.  
  

Please use this link (from a defunt blog) as an addendum.
