Esteemed friends,

I am in a need of a book, which has an elaborate English commentary upon the concept **PARA PASHYANTI MADHYAMA** & **VAIKHARI**

I have heard from a few that going through the commentaries on Lalita Sahasranama, would be of great help, as the aforesaid concept is dealt in one or two Shlokas, therein. I referred Lalita Sahasranama's commentary written by Bhaskararaya Makhi, which is considered to be the most authentic one. But I wasn't satisfied. Please guide me further.
