Hello Everyone,

I found this link, I am not sure if the group was already aware of this

  

<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/ashtadhyayi_simulator/aRt.html>

  

Is this the right way to get an understanding about making vruttis from Astadhyaayi?

Are there any caution to this method?

  

I would appreciate your feedback
