Namaste to all,

  

I happened to see a book with the title - वत्सराजप्रणीतरूपकषटम् (A collection of 6 dramas of Vatsaraja) at DLI. I am attaching its title page. Is the usage of the word "षटम्" in the title correct? Should it be षट्कम् as in निर्वाणषट्कम्? I request the learned members of this group to clear my doubt.  



regards  
shankara
