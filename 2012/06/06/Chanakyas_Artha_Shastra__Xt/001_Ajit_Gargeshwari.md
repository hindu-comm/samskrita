# The Kauṭilīya Arthaśāstra By R. P Kangale in three volumes published By Motilal Banarsidass Publication.

# Kauṭilīya Arthaśāstra translated by *Shyama Shastri*

I donot know of any English commentary on Arthaśāstra but there is a modern Sanskrit commentary in three Volumes  
of Ganapti Shastri published in TSS series.  
  
There are several modern studies on Arthaśāstra so what aspect were you looking at ?
