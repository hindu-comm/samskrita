Dear Ajit,

I wanted to know the way Chanakya deals with the behavioural aspects of human beings. I guess the concept of behaviour as dealt in the scripture is through, the characters like kings, ministers, spies and so on. I am into research and my subject is Emotions, Attitudes and Behaviours.

Dhanyavad
