Do you have उपसर्गार्थचन्द्रिका of चारुदेवशास्त्री? DLI has got two copies of second volume only and I could not find the Volume 1. If you can send it, it will be helpful for learners.  
Seems to be good reference book also with examples drawn from a wide range of literature from Vedic texts to classical literature of every genre.
