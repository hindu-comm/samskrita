Kamalesh-ji

I have taken up work in Triguna and I have been enlisting all the attributes, behavioural patterns, adjectives given to different people, attitudes so on as found in major Indian texts. The texts chosen for the study are Ramayana, Mahabharatha, Yoga Vasistha, Artha Shastra, Kama-sutras, Yoga-Sutras, Vrikshayurveda, Jyotishya, Ayurveda and Bharata's Natya shastra :-)

Dhanyavad
