aryabhata concept is geocentric



तेषामध: शनैश्चर-गुरु-भौमार्क-शुक्र-बुध-चन्द्रा: /

तॆषामधश्च भूमि: मेधीभूता खमध्यस्था //



तेषां = नक्षत्राणाम् अध: = below the stars Saturn, guru (Jupiter), mars, sun, Venus, mercury, moon under all these is the earth staying in the sky like a solid pillar or block.



It is evident from this that Aryabhata's concept was geocentric.

  

Please see my next posting.

There is a slight error in what is written above.

  

The statement \<This number coincides with the number of siderealyearsin a महायुग of 43,20,000 years.> should read as \<This number coincides with the number of sidereal days in a महायुग of 43,20,000 years.>
