Dear Group,

  

In a Marathi forum in which I am a member there was an interesting discussion about the contribution of Aryabhata I to the understanding of the motion of the Earth.HereI summarize that discussion in the hope that members of this Group will find it interesting.



The relevant verses from आर्यभटीय, necessary for this discussion, along with their free translations, are

४.९.१ अनुलोमगतिर्नौस्थ: पश्यत्यचलं विलोमगं यद्वत्।

४.९.१ अचलानि भानि तद्वत्समपश्चिमगानि लङ्कायाम्॥

(Just as a person sitting in a boat and going in the अनुलोम direction looks upon a stationary object on the bank as moving in the विलोम direction, so also on the equator the stationary stars appear to be moving from the east to the west.)

४.१०.१ उदयास्तमयनिमित्तं नित्यं प्रवहेण वायुना क्षिप्त:।  
४.१०.२ लङ्कासमपश्चिमगो भपञ्जर: सग्रहो भ्रमति॥

(On the equator, the cage formed by the stars, along with the planets, moves westwards, constantly pushed by the प्रवह wind, thus causing their rising and the setting.)

३.१५.१ भानामध: शनैश्चरसुरगुरुभौमार्कशुक्रबुधचन्द्राः ।  
३.१५.२ एषामधश्च भूमिर्मेधीभूता खमध्यस्था॥

(Below the stars are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon. Below them is the Earth in the middle of the space like the central pillar.)

४.६.१ वृत्तभपञ्जरमध्ये कक्षापरिवेष्टित: खमध्यगत:।

४.६.२ मृज्जलशिखिवायुमयो भूगोल: सर्वतो वृत्त:॥

(In the middle of the space and the cage formed by stars and surrounded by orbits, is the sphere of the Earth formed from earth, water, fire, wind.)

१.६.२ प्राणेनैति कलां भू:... In one breath, the Earth turns through one कला.



The shloka at 4.9 indicates that Aryabhata considers the stars to be fixed in their places and that the Earth 'moves'. This motion, according to most scholars, is the diurnal motion of the Earth, in which it revolved around its north-south axis. Tthere is also an opinion that this motion actually is the Earth's motion around the Sun in one year.



However, verse 4.9 clearly says that the asterisms (भानि) are fixed.
The sun and the planets, indeed, are not fixed even for the Ptolemaic Earth-centered universe because they exhibit a daily motion from the west to the east on the background of the stars. Another argument in support of the interpretation that the Earth revolves around its axis comes from verse 1.3.1 of Aryabhatiya, which reads:

१.३.१ युगरविभगणा ख्युघृ शशि चयगियिङुशुछ्लृ कु ङिशिबुणॢख्षृ प्राक्।

Here Aryabhata is laying down in a महायुग of 43,20,000 yearsthe भगणs(the number of full 360 degrees circuits, as seen on the background of fixed stars) of the Sun and the Moon and a similar number for the Earth. (Later, he gives भगणs of the other planets too.
Incidentally, Jyotish treats the Sun and the Moon as planets, just like the others.) Theseभगणsare written in a code apparently devised by Aryabhata himself, where alphabets represent numbers. This code enables him to represent vary large numbers in a concise manner. The significant point to be noted is that while other authorities give similar भगणs for नक्षत्रs, Aryabhata has given that number for the Earth, clearly indicating that the stars are stationary and the Earth is turning around its axis. He indicates this number for the Earth (कु) as follows:

ङि = ५००, शि = ७,०००, बु = २,३०,०००, णॢ = १,५०,००,००,०००, ख्षृ= ८,२०,००,०००, total १,५८,२२,३७,५००. This number coincides with the number of sidereal years in a महायुग of 43,20,000 years.

  

The next verse 4.10 creates a slight problem. In it, mention is made, as is the conventional belief, of the प्रवह वायु pushing the सग्रह भपञ्जर. Now, if the stars are fixed as verse 4.9 says, why is the प्रवह वायु at all needed to push the stars? Every scholar has noted this contradiction but none has been able to explain it.



Aryabhata indicates the measure of the Earth's motion as (१.६.२) प्राणेनैति कलां भू:...in one breath, the Earth turns through one कला.
The average rate of breathing of a healthy young person can safely be taken as 15 breaths per minute or 21,600 per day. One कला is 1/60 of अंश. A full circuit of the sky is thus 21,600 कलाs. That is why Aryabhata said प्राणेनैति कलां भू:.



Verses 3.15 and 4.6 support the belief that Aryabhata meant the Earth to be center of the cosmos, the stars being the farthest and other planets, which include the Sun and the Moon too, arranged below them.



Aryabhata's view that the stars are fixed and the Earth rotates on its axis to cause the arising and the setting of stars and planets, did not find favor with others like Brahmagupta. परमादीश्वर, the commentator who wrote भटप्रदीपिका, explained verse 4.9 by saying भानि कर्तृभूतानि अचलानि भूमिगतानि वस्तूनि कर्मभूतानि विलोमगानीव प्राचीं दिशं गच्छन्तीव पश्यन्ति, thus interpreting verse 4.9 to agree with conventional view.
'प्राणेनैति कलां भू:' he changed to ’प्राणेनैति कलां भ”, thus making the sky rotate through one कला in one प्राण. Brahmagupta too has made an adverse comment on this by asking प्राणेनैति कलां भूर्यदि तर्हि कुतो व्रजेत्कमध्वानम्। आवर्तनमुर्व्याश्चेन्न पतन्ति समुच्छ्रया: कस्मात्॥ - if the Earth moves one कला in one प्राण, then where does it go and by what route? If the Earth turns, then how is that objects at a high places do not fall down? (He has several other disagreements with Aryabhata and says आर्यभटदूषणानां सङ्ख्यां वक्तुं न शक्यते - ब्रह्मगुप्तसिद्धान्त ११.४४.)



To sum up this long discussion, while the rest of the world believed in the Ptolemaic view, Aryabhata was the first person to suggest that the stars were stationary and the movement of the sky was caused by the Earth's diurnal motion. However, he did not explain the reasoning by which he reached this conclusion. He had taken the first step towards discarding the prevalent Ptolemaic view, though nothing came out of it, as his successors did not follow it through.



Earlier I have briefly touched upon the view of some who say that Aryabhata had the heliocentric view in mind, by which the Sun is stationary and the planets, including the Earth move around it in orbits, thus predating Copernicus by several centuries. I have seen this view at several places, though I have not come across any cogent argument in its support. If any member is aware of it, may I request him to bring it out in a response?
