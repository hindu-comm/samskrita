If the meaning is "means to sight" (the eye) or "means to insight" (cognitive ability), then it is ल्युट् in the sense of करण (instrument or means) and not in भाव (abstraction or act). So the correct Sutra for the "means to insight" meaning would be करणाधिकरणयोश्च \[ल्युट्\]॥३।३।११७॥ and not ल्युट् च \[नपुंसके भावे\] ॥३।३।११५॥ as Dr. Bhat pointed out.  
  
ल्युट् is used in both senses and its use in the sense of करण is popularly known as "करणे ल्युट्" usage in many derivations in commentaries. Some other examples are  
  
वदति अनेन इति वदनम् (वद् + ल्युट्)  
पश्यति अनेन इति दर्शनम् (दृश् + ल्युट्)  
  
Incidentally, sometime back I had composed a verse with यमक figure of speech in which the word दर्शन was used multiple times with different meanings, including six philosophical schools, eye, act of seeing, cognition, illumination, and sight -  
  
अशेषदर्शनप्रदर्शन त्रिकालदर्शन सुदर्शन त्रिदर्शनेष्टबालरूपदर्शन ।  
पराङ्गनैकदर्शने हि दोषदर्शने मयि कृपां प्रवृष्य दीयतां ससीतरामदर्शनम् ॥  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
