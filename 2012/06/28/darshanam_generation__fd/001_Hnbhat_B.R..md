I don't know what your friend means.

  

  

Anyhow, it is derived as perल्युट् च (॥३।३।११५) in the abstract meaning of seeing or sight. The process is as follows:

  

दृश् + ल्युट् - as you have already mentioned, the यु is replaced by अन as per "युवोरनाकौ ७।१।१" and

"पुगन्त-लघूपधस्य च  । । PS_७,३.८६ । ।" \[prescribes गुण to the ऋ in the root, which becomes दर्\_श्+अन \> दर्शन due to the operation of

"उरण् रपरः १।१।५१". These are the specific rules that give the inflection to the verb.

  

दृशि itself used for knowledge also as sees to it, understands it etc. as in the following usage..

  

(प-१०.१; अकि-१,६.१४-७.७; रो-१,२७-३०; भा-३२/३३) पश्यति तु आचार्यः, मङ्गलार्थः च एव सिद्धशब्दः आदितः प्रयुक्तः

  

Hope this will help.
