NamaH sarvebhyaH

A friend of mine is interested in how the word darshanam is derived as per Panininean rules - ie:the lyuá¹­ suffix -ana- which expresses the instrument - to help him argue for a translation of the term as 'means to insight' rather than the more normal 'doctrine' or 'view'.

Does anyone know the relevant sutras?

thank you
