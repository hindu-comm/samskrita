Namaste Everyone,

This mail is for information alone and should not me misunderstood as any sort of product endorsement.

  

Recently I did some research on OCR (Optical characterrecognition) for Sanskrit Text. Because I wanted to Typeset (in XeLaTeX) Bellamkonda Ramarayakavi's Commentary on Gita Shankar Bhashyam and did not want to type 1800 page document.

  

Here is the link for OCR -<http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php?content=software_ind_ocr_sanskrit>

You can download and give it a try, it will convert the .Jpeg image to .Rtf text. The software is paid, free version will show you the converted text but would not allow you to copy paste to MS word or any other word processing document.It works only on Windows OS.

  

If you have a book in good shape then you can use any scanner but if you have old books which are really delicate then the below scanner is great tool to have.

<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P99KSE/ref=s9_simh_gw_p229_d0_g229_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_r=1KMZ86Q80CWXTKSQWQKS&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938811&pf_rd_i=507846>

  

The above scanner takes 32gb mini SD card, that lot of memory to have for storing pages.

  

I am attaching a screenshot of a fairly decent jpeg to Rtf conversion using this OCR. I tried few screen shots and its works. I did not buy the software yet because of mypersonal commitments I could not devote more time then I initially planned. I hope someday I will get back to this.

  

I hope someone find this post useful.

  

regards

Raama
