Dear Mr. Padmanabh,  
  
I would analyse and interpretपुण्याहवाचनं as acompound word having three words therein -  
पुण्य + अह + वाचनं  
पुण्य = sacred  
अह(न्) = day  
वाचनं = reading  
So, पुण्याहवाचनं = reading to be done on a Sacred day, rather sacred reading to be done on a sacred day or also a day to be done fulfilling and sacred by the sacred reading (even if it may not be a day of any significance; the day should become significant by the sacred reading. Sacred reading can make any day sacred.)  
पुण्याहवाचनमहम् करिष्ये is usually a संकल्प to be invoked, as if to invite the deities to the audience and to seek their blessings for the reading to be meaningful, unhindered, etc.  
Such संकल्प is preceded by describing the day and the place भरतवर्षे भरतखण्डे जम्बुद्वीपे .... श्रावण-मासे शुक्लपक्षे अद्यदिवसनक्षत्रे .... शुभपुण्यतिथौ This last word शुभपुण्यतिथौ declares the day to be sacred and benevolent.  
Such संकल्प-s are also some command to the mind to stay focused. It is also sort of an announcement to one's own mind "..a sacred task of sacred reading is now to commence. Please stay focused."  
How beautifully this is all designed, to build up the right environment and the right mood and to tune up all the faculties !  
सस्नेहम्
