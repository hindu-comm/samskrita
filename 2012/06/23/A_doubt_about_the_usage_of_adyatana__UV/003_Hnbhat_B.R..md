One more adjective of adverb used with special meaning:

  

अद्यश्वीनावष्टब्धे (5-2-13) = अद्य वा श्वो वा आसन्नप्रसवा - used as adjective to female words - in the special meaning ready to deliver today or tomorrow: अद्यश्वीना - आसन्नप्रसवा गौः, वडवा, etc.

  

अवष्टब्धम्=आसन्नम्। विजायते गर्भं धारयति इति- to be ready to give birth shortly;

  

Hope the meaning is clear. A strange word used in special case as an adjective.
