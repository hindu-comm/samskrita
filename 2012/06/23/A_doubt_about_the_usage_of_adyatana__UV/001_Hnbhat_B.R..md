Rightly it could be used as Rama, ending with "a" vowel. There is no doubt. अद्य means today. अद्यतन means today's. श्वस्तनः - tomorrow's and ह्यस्तनः - yesterday's.

  

In Hemachandra's system, the verb past tense of today is called अद्यतनी (लुङ्) , present tense is called वर्तमाना, and past tense of yesterday is called ह्यस्तनी (अनद्यतने लङ्), in the same way Future verb today is called भविष्यन्ती (लृट् अद्यतने), tomorrow onwards श्वस्तनी (अनद्यतने लुट् भविष्यति).

The same words are used as adjectives in the feminine qualifying क्रिया.
