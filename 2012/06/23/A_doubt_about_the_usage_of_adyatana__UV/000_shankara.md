Namaste to all,

  

I have a doubt about the usage of the word 'अद्यतन. I request learned members to help me resolve this problem.

  

Is it correct to use "अद्यतने वृत्तपत्रे" or "अद्यतनवृत्तपत्रे" to say, "In today's blog post". Can the word अद्यतनः have declensions like the word 'rama'?  



regards  
shankara
