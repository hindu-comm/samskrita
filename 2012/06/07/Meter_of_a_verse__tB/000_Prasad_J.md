Dear Members,  
  
I was reading Rūpa Gosvāmis 'Upadeśāmṛta' and stuck with meter for the first verse.  
  
This verse goes like this:  
vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ  
jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam  
etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ  
sarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt  
  
I tried many references to know the meter of this verse however I could not get it. This seems either to be a Viṣama-vṛtta verse, as all the 4 pādas have different syllables and also laghu-guru combination or it is some kind of Mātrā-vṛtta.  
  
Does anybody have any idea about it? I will be thankful to know this.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad J.
