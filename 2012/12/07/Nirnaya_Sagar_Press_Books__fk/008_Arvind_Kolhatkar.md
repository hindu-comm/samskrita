[This posting](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/samskrita/ohUXaJOdlUE/TkCd0w_qAQAJ;context-place=searchin/samskrita/Arvind$20Kolhatkar%7Csort:relevance)made by me in this Group 3 months ago is about Jawaji Dadaji, the founder of the Nirnaysagar Press and one of the pioneers of the book-publishing industry in Bombay, and his successors. The Name 'Nirnaysagar' itself comes from the Panchanga of the same name for which his Printing Press was established.. 

  

Even prior to Jawaji Dadaji, the same Panchangs was being printed by the first native publisher of Bombay., Ganpat Krishnaji, who brought of that Panchaga in 1831, printed by the Litho Method. Jawaji Dadaji used the Movable Type method for his Nirnaysagar Panchanga.

  

It is a recorded fact that puritan Brahmans of that time were reluctant to use Ganpat Krishnaji's Nirnaysagar Panchanga as they were afraid that the ink used in the printing was based on animal fat. Ganpat Krishnaji developed ink based on Ghee to allay this fear.
