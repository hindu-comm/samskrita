Namaste,  
  
With help Of Shankaraji I have prepared a list of Sanskrit books published by Nirnaya Sagar Press. The excel also gives links to Digital Library of India and other public domain website from where the books can be downloaded. The list excludes books printed under Kavyamala , Kavya Mala Gucchaka series. The list also excludes books printed by Nirnaya Sagar press and not published by them. For a few books I could find links from where it can be downloaded. If any titles are missing please populate the excel.
