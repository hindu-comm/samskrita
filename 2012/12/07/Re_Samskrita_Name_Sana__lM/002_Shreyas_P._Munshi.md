"Someone from our family had their daughter named 'Sana'. They say that it has a Sanskrit origin and means 'holy'. I want to know if that is true".  
  

In the last seven decades, I have not come across a Hindu female named Sana. In any case, It does not seem to be a commonly used name among the Hindus.Sanaa is also an Arabic name. Many Indian muslim girls, these days, have that name. Among my muslim acquaintances, there are at least two females with that name. And in the arabian gulf, I did meet one Egyptian paramedical lady and a palestinian lady working as a bank counter staff with the name Sanaa.

Someone from our family had their daughter named 'Sana'. They say that it has a Sanskrit origin and means 'holy'. I want to know if that is true.
