Hari Om \_()\_ :)  
  
Mahoday,  
  
This is with reference to article in **The Hindu** ( <http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/an-indian-grammar-for-international-studies/article4185358.ece?homepage=true> )  
  
In the 7th paragraph (2011 Survey 3rd paragraph), the author writes " Let me make what may seem like another astounding claim, and which I hope, in the best argumentative tradition, will be heavily contested. If all the books on war and peace were to suddenly disappear from the world, and only ***the Mahabharata remained, it would be good enough to capture almost all the possible*** debates on order, justice, force and the moral dilemmas associated with choices that are made on these issues within the realm of international politics."  
  
But i have heard a sloka or verse  
like ***yen hena thad haasti.........nasti na kwachitH, ( meaning whatever is there in Mahabharata, it's there everywhere, something which isn't there in Mahabharata, it merely doesn't exist )  
  
***Could u please share the sloka or verse  
***  
***  
Pranaam***
