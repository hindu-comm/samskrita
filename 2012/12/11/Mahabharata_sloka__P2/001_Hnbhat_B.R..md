While narrating the Mahabharata to the King Janamejaya, Vaishampayana, one of Vedavyasa’s disciples, says:  

  

  

धर्मे चार्थे च कामे च मोक्षे च भरतर्षभ \|  

यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र। यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित्॥(१/६२/५३)

*dharme cārthe ca kāme ca mokṣe ca bharatarṣabha/  
*

*yad ihāsti tad anyatra yan nehāsti na tat kvacit//(*1.62.53)

  

  

“O King! In matters pertaining to Dharma (righteousness), Artha (economics), Kama (desires), and Moksha (liberation), whatever has been said here may be found elsewhere, but whatever is not found here does not exist anywhere else!

  

The above is the complete verse with reference. (which need to be checked with any publication, as this has been culled out from the web pages online).
