Thank you very much  
  
oflate in West, particularly in US, people seem to discover a new  
posture in Yoga, a medicine and take patent  
  
In the present context(article in The Hindu), though in Mahabharata it has  
already been said  

धर्मे चार्थे च कामे च मोक्षे च भरतर्षभ \|  
यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र। यन्नेहास्ति न तत् क्वचित्॥(१/६२/५३)  
dharme cārthe ca kāme ca mokṣe ca bharatarṣabha/  
yad ihāsti tad anyatra yan nehāsti na tat kvacit//(1.62.53)  
  
  
“O King! In matters pertaining to Dharma (righteousness), Artha  
(economics), Kama (desires), and Moksha (liberation), whatever has  
been said here may be found elsewhere, but whatever is not found here  
does not exist anywhere else!  
  
  

contd...  
  
but the author of the article has written as though that was his  
opinion on Mahabharata  
  
What is your opinion? Please Reply  
  
Thank You
