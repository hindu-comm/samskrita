Dear Friends ,  
  
I was thinking about the Aasheervad / good luck greetings we exchange in various languages . Like Khuda Hafiz , take care, salam alekum etc . All these greetings or parting wishes either deal with luck or with efforts . It is only Shubha Mangal Savadhaan that deals with prabdha in the first part and efforts in the other !
