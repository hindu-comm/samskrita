Namaste . I have a question not exactly about sanskrit but rather philosophical

1\. in a purport to the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is written (<http://vedabase.net/>sb/2/2/28/en) : "[Śrīla](http://vedabase.net/s/srila)[Śrīdhara](http://vedabase.net/s/sridhara)[Svāmī](http://vedabase.net/s/svami)confirms that a part of the material nature, after being initiated by the Lord, is known as the[mahat](http://vedabase.net/m/mahat)-[tattva](http://vedabase.net/t/tattva). A fractional portion of the[mahat](http://vedabase.net/m/mahat)-[tattva](http://vedabase.net/t/tattva)is called the false ego. A portion of the ego is the vibration of sound, and a portion of sound is atmospheric air. A portion of the airy atmosphere is turned into forms, and the forms constitute the power of electricity or heat. Heat produces the smell of the aroma of the earth, and the gross earth is produced by such aroma. And all these combined together constitute the cosmic phenomenon. The extent of the cosmic phenomenon is calculated to be diametrically (both ways) four billion miles. Then the coverings of the universe begin. The first stratum of the covering is calculated to extend eighty million miles, and the subsequent coverings of the universe are respectively of fire, effulgence, air and ether, one after another, each extending ten times further than the previous. The fearless devotee of the Lord penetrates each one of them and ultimately reaches the absolute atmosphere where everything is of one and the same spiritual identity. Then the devotee enters one of the[Vaikuṇṭha](http://vedabase.net/v/vaikuntha)planets, where he assumes exactly the same form as the Lord and engages in the loving transcendental service of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of devotional life. Beyond this there is nothing to be desired or achieved by the perfect[yogī](http://vedabase.net/y/yogi)."

In some other place it is written (<http://vedabase.net/sb/3/26/52/> ) : "The dimensions of the universe are estimated here. The outer covering is made of layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and[mahat](http://vedabase.net/m/mahat)-[tattva](http://vedabase.net/t/tattva), and each layer is ten times greater than the one previous. The space within the hollow of the universe cannot be measured by any human scientist or anyone else, and beyond the hollow there are seven coverings, each one ten times greater than the one preceding it. The layer of water is ten times greater than the diameter of the universe, and the layer of fire is ten times greater than that of water. Similarly, the layer of air is ten times greater than that of fire. These dimensions are all inconceivable to the tiny brain of a human being."

It is understood from this verse that all the planets in outer space are floating, and they all hold living entities. The word[svasatam](http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/svasatam)means "those who breathe," or the living entities. In order to accommodate them, there are innumerable planets. Every planet is a residence for innumerable living entities, and the necessary space is provided in the sky by the supreme order of the Lord. It is also stated here that the total universal body is increasing. It is covered by seven layers, and as there are five elements within the universe, so the total elements, in layers, cover the outside of the universal body.The first layer is of earth, and it is ten times greater in size than the space within theuniverse; the second layer is water, and that is ten times greater than the earthly layer; the third covering is fire, which is ten times greater than the water covering. In this way each layer is ten times greater than the previous one.

  

1.So, is the first layer of our universe made of water or earth, because the above mentioned purports to SB give contradictory information. (SB 2.2.28 and SB 3.26.52 says it is water and SB 3.29.43 says it is earth)?

2.Also, what is the breadth of the first layer ? Because the purport to SB 2.2.28 says it is 80 000 000 miles while the diameter of the universe is 4 000 000 000 miles ,SB 3.29.43 says the first layer "is 10 times greaterin size than the space within theuniverse" , BUT 80 000 000 is definatly *not* 4 000 000 000 X 10.

  

Please answer if anyone knows, and provide some other scriptural references about the size and composition of the above mentioned layers
