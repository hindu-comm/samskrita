"That classical sanskrit literature never condescends to describng such anationally widespread item of food speaks volumes for its stereotyped vision."  

  

hmmm ! I just came across the pANini-sUtra -उपदंशस्तृतीयायाम् \| And the example given isमूलकेन उपदंशं भुङ्क्ते / मूलकोपदंशम् ,indicating that for the "main food item whatever it might be", mUlakam - raddish is the side dish.

  

But many restaurants today offer the "main course" as what was traditionally considered as "side", and the "side" has become "white rice / brown rice / Roti / Nan / Bread basket"! What do we do now, to reconcile practices of current day living and a language that we want to maintain as current!

  

This is just my response to the terms "condescending" and "stereotyped vision" and wondering what is expected of Sanskrit here.
