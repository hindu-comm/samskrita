I am inclined to believe that "rotikaa" is borrowed from Hindi or its prakrit parent. There are quite a few words which are of foreign origin. "tamaakhu" for tobacco, "yavana" and "hora" etc. There is certainly no harm in borrowing words from other languages. In fact it should be encouraged. That is how a laguage will get richer.

As regards "rotikaa" I wonder if it has been mentioned in Sanskrit works: at least in a "pakashastra'.

Regards

Murthy
