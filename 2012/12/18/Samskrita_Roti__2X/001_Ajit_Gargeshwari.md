[TABLE]

  
The word *roti* is derived from the Sanskrit word रोटिका (roṭikā), meaning "bread."Hindi & Urdu *roṭī* bread; akin to Sanskrit *roṭika,* kind of bread.  
  
Many food historians agree that Wheat was first cultivated around 5,000 years in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Indus valley. The wheat was made into a paste and cooked over hot stone. In Egypt, they would use the day old paste and mix it into the new dough. Finally they would isolate the yeast and lay the foundation for modern bread.  
  
In Indus valley, archaeological evidence suggest that they flattened out the stone and later made clay platter that resemble the Tawa where the bread was made on as needed basis. The Roti originated in Indus valley and is the staple food of India.  
  
The Arabs took Roti to South Asia on their trade route. During British rule, Roti arrived in Africa and West Indies by the workers on the ships.Interestingly it is National Dish of Trinidad, West Indies.
