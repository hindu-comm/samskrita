Aravindji's research into manasollasa is very remarkable. What surprises me is the felicity with which the poet describes in chaste samskrit the method of making "Roti"/"tandoori". It looks to me that if at all there is a Sanskrit word for "roti" it could be "polika" only.

That classical sanskrit literature never condescends to describng such anationally widespread item of food speaks volumes for its stereotyped vision.

Regards,

Murthy
