Molesworth's Marathi-English Dictionary (1831) says that the wordरोटी is used to describe bread made by Mohammedans or loaves made by Europeans. The Dictionary was made by him taking assistance from 7 Shastri's. 

  

As I have mentioned in one of my earlier replies in this thread, the XII century Manasollasa, while describing howपोलिका is made, does not mention the word 'Roti' at all.
