Jagannatha Pandita from the Telugu country was a great scholar. He was so poor

  

that he has expressed his sorrow in this verse.

  

I shall post its meaning after a few days.

  

जनस्थाने भ्रान्तं कनक-मृग-तृष्णान्धित-धिया

वचो वैदीहीति प्रतिपदमुदश्रु प्रलपितम् /

कृता लंकाभर्तुर्वदनपरिपाटीषुघटना

मयाप्तं रामत्वं कुशलवसुता नाप्युपगता //
