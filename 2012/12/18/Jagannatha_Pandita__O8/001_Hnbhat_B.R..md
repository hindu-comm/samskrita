Great imagination.

  

As I know, the verse was composed before the time of Acharya Mammata Bhatta, before 12th century and Jalhana in his Suktimuktavali, quotes it as from some poet शूलपाणि. And has been quoted by many Alankarika-s who followed Mammata Bhatta.(स्व३२६४, सा.द. उन्देर्४.१७, सूक्तिमुक्तावलि १२७.५, सु.र. १४७२)

  

  

  

Jagannatha Bhatta, the Telugu poet, was the contemporary of Mogal Emporor Shajahan and contemporary of Appaya dikshita (1520–1593 C).

Anyhow this has been explained earlier in another thread of shlesha verses.

  

Thanks for bringing forth the beautiful verse once again.
