Dr Bhat has raised a point about theauthorship of the verse quoted.

I do not want to dispute the version. Now I shall try to explain its

meaning.

  

As applicable to Rama.

  

Janasthana - the territory where Rama wandered in search of Sita.

  

Kanaka Mrugathrishna - Eager to catch the golden deer.

  

Vaidehi iti - Ha Site Ha Site

  

Lankaabhartuh - Of Ravana

  

Vadanaparipati - The row of faces (of Dasaanana)

  

Ishu-ghatanaa - hitting by the arrow

  

kusa-lava-sutaa - sita  

  

As applicable to the poet.

  

Janasthaana - a town

  

Kanaka-mrigatrishna - the mirage of gold or money

  

Dehiiti - give

  

kaabhartuh - bad masters (not offering any charity)  

  

vadana-paripaatiishu - faces of many people

  

kusala-vasuta - happiness and wealth

  

  

There are two aspects to be observed in this verse.

  

Alamkara – ornament -Slesha in this verse.



Rasa - sentiment -Karuna – pity is evoked in this verse

  

Rasas are nine in number. These are



शृंगार-हास्य-करुण-रौद्र-वीर्य-भयानका: /

भीभत्स-मद्भुतं शान्तं रसाह्येषा नव स्मृता: //

  

Any poetry should have one of these rasas.
