Respected scholars,

I stumbled upon this font while searching for correct rendering of devanagari script in unicode.

This font gives correct rendering for most of the triple conjuncts where usual unicode font like Mangal, Arial unicode MS fail.

The download location is<http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/>

The font is also attached as ttf file.

  

I also made this my default devanagari unicode font in my google chrome browser.

setting -> show advanced setting -> Web content -> Customize fonts -> select Siddhanta in Sans-serif font -> ok

Now I am able to read the group discussion in nearby proper devanagari rendering.

  

Heartfelt thanks to the developerMihail Bayaryn.
