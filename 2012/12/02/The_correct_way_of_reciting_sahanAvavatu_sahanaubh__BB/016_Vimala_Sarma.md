I know I said I was not going to keep posting on this but may I please
clarify what you said. Vedic texts are always written with the chant marks unless they are the pada texts where sandhi is split. This pada text is not meant for chanting but for exposition only. Each school 'shAkhA' has its own method of chanting and so they have their own books, with their own chant marks. There used to be many different shAkhA families keeping the chants, particularly in Kerala, but now most of them are extinct unfortunately. It is not permitted to chant anyway you like but you must follow a particular school. The most common in the South is the Yajurvedam. If you follow a school the teacher will make you recite again and again until he is satisfied with how you are chanting. Traditionally the most important thing is the sound, not the meaning of words, but of course words must be pronounced correctly, to give the right sound. Therefore young students are taught to chant correctly before even knowing any of the meaning of the words.
