Vimala bhagini,  
  
I would like to add that, I am learning taittiriya samhita from my guru in the traditional gurukula system. The comments made by me are based on the knowledge i gained first hand over time.  
  
I don't believe I mentioned chanting in any way is acceptable. I was more talking about a given mantra, whether it can be split by way of pausing some where in the middle, for convenience of chanting. I mentioned that it is correct to pause as long as the swara mark changes are taken into account, and the sandhi rules are obliged. This is nothing specific to any school or vedic shakha.  
  
In fact, when a student is taught the veda mantras, students would be repeating what guru says. There will be no texts involved until guru is satisfied of the pronounciation. So students have to listen intently to what guru says and repeat them. In the first few days guru would basically be using the pada patha to give the student shorter forms for repeating, over a period of time this length of each recital would be increased until the time you recite every thing in the same anuvaka without pausing. While in standard recitals, you are allowed to combine various anuvakas and pronounce in a single go.  
  
So, technically speaking, if you are pausing while chanting a mantra, you should be conforming to the pada patha. I only mentioned the same by simplifying it as conforming to swara changes as well as sandhi changes. But it is allowed.  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
