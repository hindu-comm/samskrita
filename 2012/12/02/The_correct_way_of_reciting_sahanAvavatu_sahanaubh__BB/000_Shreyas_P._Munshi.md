Respected group,

Would scholars in the group kindlyguide me as to how the shanti paaTh "sahanAvavatu sahanaubhunaktu" should be correctly recited because I hear the following three different ways in which people recite:

  

(a). om sahanAvavatu **(pause)** sahanaubhunaktu **(pause)** sahavIryamkaravAvahai **(pause)**tejasvinAvadhItamastu **(pause)** mA (very short poise..like a coma)vidvishAvahai



(b) om sahanAvavatu **(pause)**sahanaubhunaktu **(pause)** sahavIryamkaravAvahai **(pause)**

tejasvinAvadhItamastumA **(pause)** vidvishAvahai

**Asthe scholars would kindly notice, there is no pause given between 'astu' and 'mA'; instead 'mA' is joined with 'astu'. This is how the devotees in the Chinmaya Mission and the teachers of the Sanskrit teaching wing of Chitraapur Mutt recite. (I was once a member of the Chinmaya family Kuwait. At that time, of course, I was not learning Sanskrit! These daysI am learning Sanskrit under the auspices ofthe Sanskrit teaching wing of Chitraapur Mutt). To my simple mind this does not seem to be the correct way. Personally, I feel that unless the metrical rule of a 'chhanda' dictates the otherwise, the way described at (a) above seems correct. But if the metrical rule applies, could the way shown at (c) below be correct? I am told some 'chhanda' has 16 or 17 syllables in the second line, in which case the way shown at (c) could be the correct way. As a learner, I wishto clear my doubt and so am requesting for kind help.**



\(c\) Only once , from a Tamilianswami, i had heard as follows:

  

om sahanAvavatu **(pause)** sahanaubhunaktu (pause) sahavIryamkaravAvahai **(pause)**

tejasvinAvadhItamastumAvidvishAvahai

**(no pause at all in the second line from 'tejasvi....to vivdvishAvahai)**



I am told the shAntipAThs are psychically potent only if the constituent terms are correctly pronounced, and that is why I request guidence.for this shAntipATh.
