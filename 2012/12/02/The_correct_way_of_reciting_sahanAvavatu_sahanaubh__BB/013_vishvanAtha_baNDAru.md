Hi Shreyas,  
  
With the limited knowledge i have, i think that the notion of printing any vedic text is non-standard. Some of the Ramakrishna mission books tend to split the words from sandhi,put a visargah etc. Books from Mysore don't have dirgha swarita. On the top of this, there are known differences in the pAtha for the same text(!) depending on region.  
  
But as Sri Bhatji mentioned, pronunciation in any form is okay as long as the meaning is not disturbed, and IMHO, as long as the swaras are kept intact.  
  
I do know that chandas plays a role in pronunciation (there was a very useful email from Arvindji in this mailing list with a video), My guru also told me the same.  
  
I will probably ask this to my guru on thsi question, and will respond to this forum,  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
