I had earlier cited what should be the demerits in the recitation of Veda. Now I got what should be the merits of recitation of Veda, in reply to the original question, according to पाणिनीयशिक्षा, (and not our will and pleasure what should be correct pronunciation):

  

माधुर्यमक्षरव्यक्तिः *पदच्छेदस्तु सुस्वरः\|*

धैर्यं लयसमर्थं च षडेते पाठका गुणाः\|\|

  

सुस्वरः will imply both melody of voice and also the accentuation स्वर-s which are native only for Vedic mantra-s today.

The underlined emphasizes both the clarity of words and without any deformation of स्वर-s.
