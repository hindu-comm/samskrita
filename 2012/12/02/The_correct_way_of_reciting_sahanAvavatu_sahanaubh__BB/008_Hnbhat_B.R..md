Sorry the above only I had in my mind. The below in English is incorrect and means differently and does not make a coherent sentence though individual .

Again, sorry for my inadvertent posting. In English Now I have corrected the word space in the English roman text according to the meaning and the Sanskrit text which makes it the correct sentence to give thle correct meaning intended.

Here is the English Translation:

  

Om !

  

a\. May He protect us both together;

may He nourish us both together;  

  

b\. May we work conjointly with great energy,

  

*c. May our study be vigorous and effective;*

  

d\. May we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).

  

Om ! Let there be Peace in me !

  

Let there be Peace in my environment !

  

Let there be Peace in the forces that act on me !\[6\] (from Viki-pedia);

  

  

*The point is नौ is the same as in the above lines, but in genetive case* and not the dual number of तेजस्विन्+औ - तेजस्विनौ accusative as in the first two lines a and b which does not agree with the verb also भुनक्तु and does not agree with any word in the stanza for that matter, if taken in accusative of तेजस्विन्. But it is only neuter gender nominative singular and agrees with the verb अस्तु and grammatically perfect sentence.

And finally, I could not understand your problem at all, with your jumbled message though once again I looked into it.
