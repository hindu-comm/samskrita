**I looked up my chanting book "mantra puSpam" on page 4 for the shanti mantras.**

**There is no danda after astu here (in this book), so there should be no sentence pause, betweem astu and mA.**

Vimala-ji,

Thank you.

So it seemsthe full line 'tejasvinA....hai' should be uttered in single go (as I had heard the Tamilian swami do some twenty years ago) and thatwhile there should be no break between 'astu' and 'mA' (as you say), breaking the line at 'tejasvinAvadhItamastuMavid-' and separately uttering 'vishaavahai' should also be avoided for the same reason (besides of course it being not correct to break it as' vid-vishaavahai', as you pointed out earlier)..

  

**With your explanation, and Bhat Sir's assertion that understandingand conveying the meaning should be given more importance than how the mantra is chanted,** **I too will close the discussion here.**



I would still love to know the 'chhanda' in which this shaantipaaTh is structured. Perhaps Shri S L Abhyankar Sir or Shri Nityanand Mishra Sir could throw some light on it (although, in our learning programme,we would be taught chhanda-s only after two years from now!).

  

With thanks and regards to all,

...Shreyas.

Shreyas-Ji

I looked up my chanting book "mantra puSpam" on page 4 for the shanti mantras.

There is no danda after astu here (in this book), so there should be no sentence pause, betweem astu and mA.

I hope this clarifies your question.

I am not an expert in Vedic chanting, so this is my last conribution on this subject.

Vimala
