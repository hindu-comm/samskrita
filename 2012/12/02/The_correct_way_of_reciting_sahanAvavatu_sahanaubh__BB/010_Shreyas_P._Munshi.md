**I was taught to pronounce all of the "tEjaswinA......hai" all in a single go. I am taught from a vedic scholar...Vissu.  
  
**Vissu Sir,

Is the reciting of the whole line in a single go because of the requirement of the 'chhanda' used? If yes, what is that chhanda? That line has 15 syllables. Is there a chhanda in which the second line has 15 syllables that need to be uttered in a single go? In that case, the printing should also be in one line, no? if the printing leaves space between 'astu' and 'mA' and 'vidvishAvahai', as is found donein many books, a learning reader would, in good faith,break or pause between those terms. Is there no standard way of printing the shAntipATh, Sir?

  

In any case one thing thatseems to be emerging is that either the line 'tejasvinA....hai' has to be uttered in a single go; or if a break is used it would be after 'astu' to be followedby separately uttering the imperative ist pers dual 'mA vidvishAvahai'. But it would not be correct to break after 'tejas...astumAvid' and following it up by 'vishaavahai' as many seem to be doing.

Is my understanding correct, Sir?

Regards...Shreyas.
