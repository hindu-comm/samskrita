Respected Scholars,  
  
I was taught to pronounce all of the "tEjaswinA......hai" all in a single go. I am taught from a vedic scholar.  
  
Purely from a pronounciation perspective, here is what i am taught. It is allowed to pause at the danda mark or continue ignoring the danda mark. However, we must be aware that the vedic swara marks change depending on whether you are pausing or continuing. Therefore your pronounciation should change accordingly. In fact, you can even pause at a word break, as long as you are familiar with swara marks and how they change (and ofcourse the sandhi rules and various 'words' in your mantra).  
  
For example, if you are pausing at a word which ends with a letter with a swarita, it automatically becomes a dirgha-swarita. The example is the 'mAvidwishavahai', where 'hai' has a swarita, and since we pause there, we have to pronounce it as a dirgha-swarita.  
  
While some-what unrelated, I would also stress on the swarita, dIrgha-swatita, and anudatta marks while pronouncing this mantra.  
  
For example, the word 'viryam' in the mantra has a anudatta for 'vi' and followed by swarita for ryam. This is called nicha-swarita. It means that the 'ryam' has to be pronounced with increased stress than a normal swarita.  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
