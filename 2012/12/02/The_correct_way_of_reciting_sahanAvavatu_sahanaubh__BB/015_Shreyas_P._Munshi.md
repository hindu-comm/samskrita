\>Hi Shreyas,  
  
With the limited knowledge i have, i think that the notion of printing any vedic text is non-standard. Some of the Ramakrishna mission books tend to split the words from sandhi,put a visargah etc. Books from Mysore don't have dirgha swarita. On the top of this, there are known differences in the pAtha for the same text(!) depending on region.  
  
  
But as Sri Bhatji mentioned, pronunciation in any form is okay as long as the meaning is not disturbed, and IMHO, as long as the swaras are kept intact.  
  
I do know that chandas plays a role in pronunciation (there was a very useful email from Arvindji in this mailing list with a video), My guru also told me the same.  
  
  
I will probably ask this to my guru on thsi question, and will respond to this forum,  
  
Thanks  
Vissu

I was taught to pronounce all of the "tEjaswinA......hai" all in a single go. I am taught from a vedic scholar...Vissu.  
  
  
Vissu Sir,  
Is the reciting of the whole line in a single go because of the requirement of the 'chhanda' used? If yes, what is that chhanda? That line has 15 syllables. Is there a chhanda in which the second line has 15 syllables that need to be uttered in a single go? In that case, the printing should also be in one line, no? if the printing leaves space between 'astu' and 'mA' and 'vidvishAvahai', as is found donein many books, a learning reader would, in good faith,break or pause between those terms. Is there no standard way of printing the shAntipATh, Sir?  
  
  
  
In any case one thing thatseems to be emerging is that either the line 'tejasvinA....hai' has to be uttered in a single go; or if a break is used it would be after 'astu' to be followedby separately uttering the imperative ist pers dual 'mA vidvishAvahai'. But it would not be correct to break after 'tejas...astumAvid' and following it up by 'vishaavahai' as many seem to be doing.  
  
Is my understanding correct, Sir?  
Regards...Shreyas.
