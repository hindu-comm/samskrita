Respected Vimala-ji,

  
Re: \[Samskrita\] The correct way of reciting "sahanAvavatu sahanaubhunaktu"  
  

About 'vidvishaavahai', thank you very much for pointing out the finer point: I now understand it should be pronounced 'vi-dvi-shaa-va-hai'and not 'vid-vi-shaa-va-hai'. But I am still not clear if 'astu' and 'mA' should be pronounced in the same breath.  
  
Bhat Sir's Devanagari typing clearly shows that there is a 'danda' after 'astu', and 'mA' comes in the next line.  
  
The recitation in Cynthia madam's tape is all in one breath from 'astu' to 'vidvishavahai'. Perhaps that is the correct way, if a metrical rule applies there. My doubt, however, still remains un-cleared: Is it correct to join 'astu' and 'mA' and pause after'mA' as if there is a 'danda' after 'mA' and then utter 'vidvishAvahai' separately(as done by many)?  
  
I think (if I am allowed to think!) that either the whole line from 'astu' to 'vidvishaavahai' should be uttered without a break in between or the 'astu' and the 'mA' must be uttered separately (and not joined).  
  
I request direction from scholars.  
Regards...Shreyas

Respected group members,  
  
The recording of this mantra by my guru, Sree Aswath, and his Veda Recitation Class will be available for download for the next 7 days:

Of course, there must be some slight pause for breath when chanting and some chanters have more breath than others. Also, those who chant rapidly can include more in one breath.  
  
The attached file shows the English meaning of the words, with sandhi broken. It is better if a pause for breath is at the end of a phrase — or at least not in the middle of a word!  
  
Actually there is an optimum way to chant, as described in the first mantras of Taittiriiya Upanishad, Part 1. Not too fast or too slow, maintaining a consistent length of short and long vowels and so forth. Learning correctly from a teacher is so important.

Respected group,  
Would scholars in the group kindly guide me as to how the shanti paaTh "sahanAvavatu sahanaubhunaktu" should be correctly recited because I hear the following three different ways in which people recite:  
  
(a). om sahanAvavatu (pause) sahanaubhunaktu (pause) sahavIryamkaravAvahai (pause)tejasvinAvadhItamastu (pause) mA (very short poise..like a coma) vidvishAvahai  
  
(b) om sahanAvavatu (pause)sahanaubhunaktu (pause) sahavIryamkaravAvahai (pause)  
tejasvinAvadhItamastumA (pause) vidvishAvahai  
As the scholars would kindly notice, there is no pause given between 'astu' and 'mA'; instead 'mA' is joined with 'astu'. This is how the devotees in the Chinmaya Mission and the teachers of the Sanskrit teaching wing of Chitraapur Mutt recite. (I was once a member of the Chinmaya family Kuwait. At that time, of course, I was not learning Sanskrit! These days I am learning Sanskrit under the auspices of the Sanskrit teaching wing of Chitraapur Mutt). To my simple mind this does not seem to be the correct way. Personally, I feel that unless the metrical rule of a 'chhanda' dictates the otherwise, the way described at (a) above seems correct. But if the metrical rule applies, could the way shown at (c) below be correct? I am told some 'chhanda' has 16 or 17 syllables in the second line, in which case the way shown at (c) could be the correct way. As a learner, I wish to clear my doubt and so am requesting for kind help.  
  
(c) Only once , from a Tamilian swami, i had heard as follows:  
  
om sahanAvavatu (pause) sahanaubhunaktu (pause) sahavIryamkaravAvahai (pause)  
tejasvinAvadhItamastumAvidvishAvahai  
(no pause at all in the second line from 'tejasvi....to vivdvishAvahai)  
  
I am told the shAntipAThs are psychically potent only if the constituent terms are correctly pronounced, and that is why I request guidence.for this shAntipATh.
