ऊँ सह नाववतु, सह नौ भुनक्तु

 सह वीर्यं करवावहै ।

तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु ।

 मा विद्विषावहै ।

ऊँ शान्ति: शान्ति: शान्ति:।

  

  

OM saha naavavatu,

Saha nau bhunaktu,

Saha veeryam karavaavahai.

Tejasvinaavadheetamastu.

Maa vidvishaavahai.

OM Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih!

  

I don't know about pause in between. Probably it follows word pause, if one is careful about the meaning and the पाद endings and the correctness for meaning or words, doesn't differ.

  

The pause is not governed by the grammar anyway. It is the convenience of the people to pronounce caring for the words and their meaning. A little more care for the पाद-s may help in understanding. For recitation, it follows some times accent notations, but not in every शान्तिपाठ,which may some times affect the way pause in hearing the words for the hearers.

  

  

This is my idea.
