First of all, what do you want with the word in the poetry?

  

There are thousands of usages of the word in the vast literature of Sanskrit.. If you can be specific about your question, you will certainly get the reply according to your requirement.

  

Otherwise, you can search on internet and find dozens of pages containing the word and you can get what you require yourself. Just Google for pratyUsha or pratyUSha ओर् बोथ्.
