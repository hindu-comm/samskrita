If we use अयमंशुमृणालिकामुखै (this in instrumental)

Though this face of lotus-fibre rays (of light) the moon causes the darkness to be sucked up. Perhaps the author is stressing how delicate the rays of light from the moon are by comparing it to a fibre of a lotus (already considered to be a very delicate flower).



Anyway I think the causative use is correct. In translating it is important to stick to the grammar (I know I make this mistake myself!) and not be tempted to put what you think might be the case. Many people give very loose translations of texts, because they forget this.

Friends,



Sorry, I cannot write in the technical terms of Panini's grammar.



Whitney, in paragraph 277a of his 'Sanskrit Grammar', observes that acausative form of a transitive verb regularly admits two accusative objects and cites, as an example,वणिजो दापयेत्करान् (Manusmriti), 'he should cause the merchants to pay taxes'. He further observes that a causative sometimes takes an instrumental instead of a second accusative.



Following these observations would it be correct to say that



1\) अयमंशुमृणालिकामुखान्

तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमा:



and



2) -

स्तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमा:



would both be correct usages, the former being 'regular' and the latter exceptional?
