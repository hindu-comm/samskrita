I don't see anything even in the sense of causative. The technique is in the verb, to suck. = drink both are meant by the verb. No, the tips of stalk of lotus in the form of rays, drinks the darkness. 

  

अंशु-मृणालिकामुखानि तिमिरं चूषन्ति -   

  

So, the moon,

  

अयं मृणालिकामुखैः तिमिरं चूषयति -

makes them to drink the darkness.

  
In other words he drains the darkness of the night through the pipe of stalk of lotus in the form of (his) rays (white).

  

Hope this makes sense of the causative.
