Friends,

  

Sorry, I cannot write in the technical terms of Panini's grammar.

  

Whitney, in paragraph 277a of his 'Sanskrit Grammar', observes that acausative form of a transitive verb regularly admits two accusative objects and cites, as an example,वणिजो दापयेत्करान् (Manusmriti), 'he should cause the merchants to pay taxes'. He further observes that a causative sometimes takes an instrumental instead of a second accusative.

  

Following these observations would it be correct to say that

  

1\) अयमंशुमृणालिकामुखान्

तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमा:

  

and

  

2)अयमंशुमृणालिकामुखै-

स्तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमा:

  

would both be correct usages, the former being 'regular' and the latter exceptional?
