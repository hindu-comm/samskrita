Thank you all very much for your replies. Sorry I mean to write 'drinks the darkness' not 'drinks the moonlight' as several people have pointed out. 

  

Thank you Dr Bhat for your suggestion. That seems sensible and in fact elsewhere we have seen similar usages. Even within this same poem (the Madhura Vijaya of Gangadevi) we have the following:

  

जन एष वचस्तवामृतं

श्रवसा पाययितुं कुतूहली ॥

  

which clearly means 'I (this person standing before you) want to drink in the amrita of your words with my ears' but literally must mean 'I want to cause my ears to drink in the amrita of your words'. 

  

At any rate the important thing for us is that the sense is clear - it is the moon that is finally drinking the darkness, not anyone else (the lotus stalk straws cannot themselves drink the darkness).
