Namaste

Does anyone know if the causative form of the verb cUS ('to drink, suck up'), cUSayati, can be used in a non-causative sense - ie: to simply mean 'he sucks up' rather than 'he causes (someone else) to suck up'?
Monier Williams suggests it can but Apte's dictionary doesn't offer anything on this.

The context is the following verse in which we believe that it is the moon himself who drinks the moonlight rather than that he is making someone else (possibly the mountain peak) drink the moonlight:

  

प्रथमाचलमौलिमुच्चकै-

रधिरुह्याम्बरपात्रसम्भृतम् ।

अयमंशुमृणालिकामुखै-

स्तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमाः ॥

  

Many thanks.
