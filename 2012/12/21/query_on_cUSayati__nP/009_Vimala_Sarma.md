Venetia-Ji

The causative is fine here. स्तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमाः

The moon (nominative) causes ( **- iva-) as it were** the darkness ( accusative) to be sucked up. The verse is not saying the moon is doing the sucking up. Through its light it appears as though the darkness is made to disappear. This is the sense.

With the sense organs like ears etc - the concept that their respective sense objects cause them to hear etc goes back a very long way to BrhU.
The philosophical idea is noise causes the ears to hear, sight causes the eyes to see, etc is in the Indian psyche.

In the case of your next example, it is the nectar of words wich causes the ears to drink in the wonder of it.
