As per the text given, it is the darkness that is sucked up by the moonand not the moonlight. Knowingly or unknowingly the poet has used the causative, although the sense is clearly not causative. If we treat the poet as an authority for usage, we may give this as an example where the causative can also be used in a non-causative sense. Otherwise we could treat it as a slip of the poet.
