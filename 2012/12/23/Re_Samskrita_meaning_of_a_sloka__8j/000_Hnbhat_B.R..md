Does your friend know Sanskrit at all or not? If he knows, he can read the explanation in Samskrit for the full explanation for the complete verse:

The commentary is in easy language. If not, here is the English Translation:

If he doesn't know well Sanskrit, it is not useful even with word to word meaning.

  

Anyhow, members are welcome to type the whole verse which is Sragdhara metre and split padaccheda and word meaning.

  

If any one is interested, I can give the audio of the complete सूर्यशतक of the poet मयूर from which this first line is only taken for "padaccheda" and meaning. As it appears from the translation, it is full of pun on the side of Sun and Bhava with the adjectives. This is a clue for the translation if any body willing to do.
