For those interested in prosody, the site<http://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Chanda/HTML/list_all.html> is a very good resource. They have a database, as of today, of 1352 meters. When you enter the sequence of syllables in a quarter of a verse in the 'laghu-guru' order following the Kyoto-Harvard convention,it identifies the meter.

  

Its limitation appears to be that it works only for akSharagaNavrittas and not for maatraagaNavRittas.

  

While several old and new books in various languages are available for those interested in prosody, I find that the Hindi book 'ChaandaPrabhaakara' by Jagannath Prasad 'Bhanu' is very comprehensive and user-friendly. It is available at the DLI site.
