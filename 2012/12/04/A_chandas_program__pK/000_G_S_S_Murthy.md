Dear all,

Several years back I had developed a java app. which outputs the name of a Sanskrit metrical structure if a quarter of any Sanskrit verse in Roman characters as per Baraha convention is input. A software expert Mr.Venkatesh [nsvnar...@gmail.com]() whom I got in touch with through this \[Samskrita\] group has been kind enough to convert it into an executable app in Windows. This file is now available at

*<http://www.mediafire.com/?p21y045io80il5o>*

Those interested may download it and use.

Feedback could be given to me at [murt...@gmail.com]()

Regards

Murthy
