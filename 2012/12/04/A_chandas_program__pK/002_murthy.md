"hariNee","jayadeva3","jayadeva5puurvaardha","jayadeva5uttaraardha","kuTaka",

 "deSikadayaapUrvaardha","deSikadayaa_uttaraardha"

You will see in the above list some metres used by poets but not listed in "Vruttaratnaakara". I have given some adhoc names to them tagged on to the name of the poet. The program also recognizes Anushtup and Aryaa.

Regards,

Murthy
