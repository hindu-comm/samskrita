सु + सु + गम् ???  
This means a double prefix which would be grammatically incorrect.  
सुस्वागत can be used as an adjective is used but its usage as verb is not found in Sanskrit. It is sounds more like a Hindi word.  
The usage quoted from Ramayana may be considered to be आर्षः प्रयोगः  
If a word is used one must able to derive the word from grammatical principles. Can some one please show how the word can be derived?
