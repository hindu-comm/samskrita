Great finding.

  

सु in स्वागत is duplicated as a special case for पितृकार्य.

  

Can you please quote some authority of प्रयोग to which such practice in
the शाखा belongs

  

Anyhow, thanks for the information.



I don't think if it can be used in the case of dead manes, why it cannot be used in respect of living human beings around us for welcoming them.

  

स्वागतम् is also used in respect of veneration of Gods in पूजा-s comprising of of sixteen items offered as one of the items.

The above are the usages in भागवतपुराण of स्वागत only. welcoming expression used in respect of all persons, irrespective of gender, or number.
