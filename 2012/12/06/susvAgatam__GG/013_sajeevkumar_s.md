Respected scholars! My greetings.  
I just happened to visit this group today.  
The discussions are really enriching and giving more insight to the reader. Thank you.  
Now about the usage सुस्वागतम्. Can we conclude this in this way that since the usage is found in many places, the usage of सुस्वागतम् is proper?  
Thank you.
