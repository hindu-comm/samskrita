Thank you Bhat Sir for giving the etymology of 'vAsuki':

  
पुं०। वसुकस्यापत्यमिति। वसुक + इञ्।)  
  

And then a question arises: What is the difference between 'naga' and 'sarpa'?  
  
To me, as a simpleton,it appears that semiotically all the gross items and entities in our mythology represent some very subtle concepts. Naga-s and sarpa-s seem to represent the thoughts...naga-s representing venomous thoughts and sarpa-s the non-malign thoughts. To me, that seems to be the reason why Shiva has a naga around his neck (he drank poison to save the world by holding it in his throat so the 'poison' would not spread over the whole system, and in RaamayaNa, Raama and Laxmana get caught in Naagapaasha from which none but Vishnu's Garuda could free them); and in Geeta, Arjun sees Lord Krishna with (divine) sarpa-s around his neck.  
  
But then it beats me when we read in Geeta (10.28) 'sarpāṇām asmi vāsukiḥ' and in 10.29 'anantaś cāsmi nāgānāḿ' here meaning 'among the sarpa-s i am Vasuki and among the naga-s i am anantha'  
  
But my query about the etymology of 'vAsuki' stands fully answered by you,Sir.  
  
Regards...Shreyas

अहिपतिः। तत्पर्यायः। सर्पराजः २।इत्यमरः॥ वासुकेयः ३। इति शब्दरत्नावली।  
तस्योत्पत्तिर्यथा-  
सुरसा जज्ञिरे सर्पांस्तेषां राजा तु तक्षकः।  
वासुकिश्चैव नागानां गणाः क्रोधतमोऽधिकः॥  
इति वह्निपुराणे काश्यपीयवंशः॥  
While वासुकि is the king of नाग-s, तक्षक is the king of सर्प-s as per the above quotation taking सर्प-s different from नाग-s.

Would a scholar kindly throw light on the etymology of the mythological name 'vAsuki', the Naga that was used for samudramanthan?
