Namaste,

I was wondering if anyone in the group has this book, I want to typeset this book in XeLaTeX.

I tried using OCR with available pdf at [archive.org](http://archive.org/search.php?query=Geeta%20Bashyarka) but that did not work because of poor scan quality. Venkateshji from this forum said the scan quality is very bad less than 100 dpi.

  

If anyone has the book and would be kind enough to loan the book to me so that I could take high resolution scan.

If lending is not possible then can somebody please upload better resolution scan online.

  

I would really appreciate your help
