Raama,

  

Please try this and see if it works.

  

In [archive.org](http://archive.org), when you open the into page of a book you will see links like 'Read online', 'pdf' etc. At the bottom of this list you will see the link 'All files HTTPS'. When you click on it, another page will open, giving versions in different formats. One of these is .txt. It is plain text. You can download it and add LaTeX mark-ups to it.

  

Incidentally, I also use this for searching for a word in a book. The .pdf version is actually a collection of pictures of pages and does not let the user search for a word in in. I open the .txt version, search for the word and locate its page number. I then go back to the pdf version and pick up from there.
