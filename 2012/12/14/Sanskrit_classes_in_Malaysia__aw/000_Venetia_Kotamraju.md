Sanskrit Classes in Malaysia

  

Students will be guided on how to speak, read and write in the ancient Sanskrit language. No prior knowledge is required.

All you need is the passion to learn and I will guide you. It is not difficult to speak in Sanskrit. It is a unique experience that you can gift to yourself. Sanskrit is the world’s most ancient living language which is a treasure house of vast knowledge of life wisdom, philosophies, sciences, economics, social studies and arts. It is the key to the study in the original the Hindu scriptures on Yoga and Vedanta, Buddhist scriptures, Jain scriptures and the great epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. There is no other ancient language which is comparable to the literary vastness of Sanskrit.



Research shows Sanskrit sounds have therapeutic effects on the human brain and body. Learning Sanskrit is proven to enhance brain capacities and memory power. The Sanskrit language has the most scientific sound and grammar system. The class will not be limited to the study of language alone but there will be special sessions on the history and science of the language as well as introductions to the various branches of Sanskrit learning from time to time.
