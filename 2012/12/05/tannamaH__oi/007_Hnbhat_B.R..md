Monier William doesn't give from Panini's Dhatupatha.

  

That is the only difference, but only the actual form in use by his colleagues.

  

Panini has his reservations, and the accessory धातुपाठ provided with it has to agree with his whole system of his rules laid down with these roots, in his अष्टाध्यायी, while MW has to agree with Whitney or any European grammarian dealing with them. That is the difference.

  

  

Quoting from MW is not at all against TO OR more authentic than the verbs quoted from धातुपाठ which itself self explanatory in the place of different abbreviation to explain it in Dictionary compilation.

  

Hope this makes it clear. In fact, there is no root beginning with ण alone, but only prefixed with consonants "r" which for MW will become as प्रणम्, प्रणु etc.
