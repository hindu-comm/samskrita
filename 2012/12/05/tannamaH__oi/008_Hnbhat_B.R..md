I think there is no need to quote all the editions of धातुपाठ, as there is no question for traditional पाणिनीयव्याकरण, धातुपाठ ascribed to पाणिनि is authority. For all other practical purposes, one can use either the Dhatu List, given by any Whityney, or Macimillan or Monier Williams can be used. The purpose being different served by both.

  

Better not to make such provocative statements, authority here or anywhere, since this is a list of all the Sanskrit Learners, either by western method or Indian traditional Grammar in the traditional method. Both commonly contribute to increase the knowledge of the members.
