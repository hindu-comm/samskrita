Only one manuscript out of 5 used for the critical edition of ManMohan Ghosh, has the reading

  

तन्नमः सात्त्विकं शिवम्।

  

and all the others have the same reading "तं नुमः" as it has been suggested earlier.

  

And according to संगीतरत्नाकर also takes the same reading according to the Editors.

  

This is just for observation. Further analysis can be made on this observation.
