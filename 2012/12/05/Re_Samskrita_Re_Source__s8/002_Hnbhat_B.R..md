> What would be the samaas vigraha for the word - कर्मानुगो ?\\  



but कर्म अनुगच्छतीति - *कर्मानुगः* - following his past acts, कर्म which cannot be translated in plain English, like act, deed, work etc.

  

It is technically used in the philosophy, and ontology and has a wider meaning. कर्म संचितम्, प्रारब्धम्,

  

  

यथेह कर्मचितो लोकः क्षीयते -

शुक्ल - कृष्ण- शुक्लकृष्ण  

  

By Punyakarma, one goes to स्वर्ग etc. वेदाध्ययन etc. prescribed by Shastra-s, heavenly worlds, while कृष्ण the कर्म-s opposed by शास्त्र-s one goes downwards नरक. And शुक्लकृष्ण  partly शुक्ल as they are prescribed by वेद etc, like the पशुयाग, and so on which leads in the other world. leading the जीव, following which जीव alone goes accompanied by his कर्म, of the type, to destined paraloka. स्वर्ग, नरक etc.

  

and

  

परलोकमार्गे जीव एकः कर्मानुगो गच्छति - is the perfect sentence

  

Only the जीव continues in the path of other world lead by by his कर्म-s good, or bad.

  

The others end with burnt fire his body, and others follow only up to Shmashana. After that जीव along travels in the path of other world with only the accompaniment of his कर्म-s. Hence there is nothing to wonder in the structure.

  

’

> If it is karmam anu gachchhati,

  

Certainly it is not कर्मम् अनु गच्छति.
