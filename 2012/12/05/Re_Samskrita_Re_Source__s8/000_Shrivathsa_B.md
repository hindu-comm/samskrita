hariH OM,  
shrii subhash,  
  
 karmAnugaH = the one who follows karma. This is not a verb. This is a noun form (kR^idanta) derived from a verb.  
  
 What the shloka is saying is that the jiiva is a follower (anugaH) and follows (gacChati) his karma.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
