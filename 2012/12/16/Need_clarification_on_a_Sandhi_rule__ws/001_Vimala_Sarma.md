Aniruddha- ji



It is also in kaṭhopaniṣad, valli three, last line.

*ya imam paramaṃ guhyaṃ śrᾱvayed brahma-saṃsadi,*

*prayataḥ śrᾱddha-kᾱle vᾱ tad ᾱnantyᾱya śrᾱddha-kalpate, tadᾱnantyᾱya **kalpata iti.*** (17)



Not sure what sort of expalnantion you want, but here is a linguistic one.

e is a diphong, it it takes up two moraes - it is long vowel ie two mātrā

If you add another short vowel to this - it becomes three moraes

To say a vowel of three moraes e+i is difficult and you would say it like this - **ayi**.

In Sanskrit (and other languages) you cannot have a vowel of three moraes (the rule of three moraes) so the y is dropped creatinga hiatus, therfore you get **a (gap)** followed by **i**. The gap denotes the missing mātra.

In German there is not the same problem because you can use the umlaut to denote that the vowels should be said separately - **ëi**.

I hope this makes some sense.
