Aniruddha- ji

The problem is not orthographic - it has to do with pronunciation.

Three morae vowels are usually said running them together - for example e+i would be run together to give a contracted vowel. To keep these separate you would either need to have a semi-vowel in between (y, v, r, l) or have a gap. Sometimes a consonant is used.

Contraction occurs even with the semi-vowels and is common in prakrits such as Pali

ava- is often changed to o

aya - may change to e

For example the word bhavati (bh goes to h, ava goes to o) so you get hoti in Hindi and also Pali.



In Vedic you have pluta which is the length of time you hold on to a sound - three beats.
