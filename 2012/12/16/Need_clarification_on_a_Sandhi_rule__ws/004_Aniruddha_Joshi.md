Thank you Vimala-ji for the lucid explanation.  
  
By the way, I have another question. Is the problem of having three morae a purely orthographic one? The pronunciation of **ëi** (एई) hardly sounds challenging. Also, the Vedic language has words such as **तितउ (titäu) **involving vowel sounds juxtaposed. (In this case there are only 2 short vowels, though).**  
  
**

I would be glad to have an explanation on this.  

  

Thanks and Regards,  
Aniruddha
