Dear all,  
  
Namaste.  
  
I wish to join either BA or MA in Sanskrit. I do not know the  
pre-requisites for the same. If I can see the detailed syllabus of  
both the courses, I can decide upon what to take up. I want to join  
either Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati or Rashtriya Sanskrit  
Samsthan. Can anyone please give the detailed syllabus of both the  
institutions? In the internet, I could not find the syllabus, though  
other information are present.  

  
\~With Prayers and Regards,  
Swami Suprajnananda,  
Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore.
