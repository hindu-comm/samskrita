Dear Swami,



As I am a student of The University at Thirupathi, I know some details.



If your language at +1 and +2 level was Sanskrit, you are allowed to do straightaway. Or you have to qualify yourself with a Diploma in Sanskrit and then enter the P.G. level.



You may contact their office at Thirupathi : 0877 2287745



For your information, even for a Diploma, their syllabus is vast.



Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan may be contacted by obtaining their number from their website.



With regards,

Parvathy
