so you could interpret mama karaNiyam as my duty.

\>karaNIyam could mean both "doing" and "duty" - in fact duty is also "kartavyam" which uses tavyat pratyaya which is equivalent to "aniyar" pratyaya.  
so you could interpret mama karaNiyam as my duty.

Requesting help from scholars:  
  
There is a Sanskrit song "lokahitam mama karNIyam".  
  
Why is the possessive case 'mama' used? Should it not be the trutIyA case 'mayA'there so that the line would read 'lokahitam mayA karaNIyam'?  
  
Or is it that with the 'aaniya' pratyaya, use of both (the sixth and the third vibhakti) is permissible?
