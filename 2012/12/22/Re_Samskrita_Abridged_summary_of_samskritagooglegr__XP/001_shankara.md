Please be more specific. What sense is intended here - do you want an auspicious (Maṅgalārthaka verse) or a verse to invite people in marraige? Are you looking for a standalone verse (e.g. to be printed on the cover), or do you want to write the entire invitation in Samskrita? Without such details, it is difficult to help.  
  
You may find useful the attached invitation in Samskrita that I used for my father's Ṣaṣṭipūrti programme earlier this year. I included a Hindi translation also in the card so that people who do not understand Samskrita can also follow.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
