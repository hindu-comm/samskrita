Three types of poetic composition.



Sansktiy Poetry is classified into three types depending on the difficulty in understandingthe meaning. These are draakshaa paaka, kadaliipaaka, and naalikerapaaka.



Draakashapaaka – Easy to understand as eating the grape which has no outer cover. The grape fruit.



Kadaliipaaka – not very difficult – requires only the outer cover to be removed.

The plantain fruit.



Naalikerapaaka – very difficult – the fruit has two covers – the first one a thick fibrous one. The second a hard shell. Then only the edible portion appears. The

coconut fruit.



There is a saying – Bharaverarthagauravam. It is difficult to understand the meaning of

Kiratarjuniya composed by Bharavi.



Mallinatha the great commentator starts his commentary on Kiratarjuniya with the introduction –



नारिकेलफलसम्मितं वचो

भारवॆस्सपदि तद्विभज्यते /

स्वादयन्तु रसगर्भनिर्भरम्

सारमस्य रसिका यथेप्सितम् //



He says he is breaking them coconut of Bharavis work for the readers to enjoy.

I thought I would share this information with the members who may not be aware of this. I also request

members to give samples of draakaashapakam and kadaliipakam poems.
