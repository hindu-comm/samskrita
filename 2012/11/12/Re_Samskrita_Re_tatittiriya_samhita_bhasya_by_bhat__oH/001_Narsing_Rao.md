Not sure what you mean by MORI (or do you mean BORI?). Here is a (lengthy) reply:  
  
Government Oriental Library Series Mysore has published the following in 1900-02:  

1.  Taittiriya Brahmana with the commentary of Bhattabhaskara, edited
    by A. Mahadeva Shastri 2.  Taittirya Aranyaka with the commentary of Bhattabhaskara, edited
    by A. Mahadeva Shastri and K Rangacharya

Both the above are have been reprinted by Motilal Banarasidas (<http://www.mlbd.com>) , but these may not be available. These are complete and can be downloaded from [archive.org](http://archive.org)  
  
Anandashram (Pune) (<http://www.anandashram-sanstha.org/>) has published Taittiriya Aranyaka with the commentary of Sayana. This is complete and also downloadable from [archive.org](http://archive.org). You can download their list of publications from their site.  
  
Note: There are two versions of the Taittiriya Aranyaka - The Mysore edition has 8 prapathakas whereas the Anandashram edition has 10 prapathakas.  
  
Regarding Taittiriya Brahmana with Sayana's commentary, Anandashram has published it. I have a hard copy published by Nag Publishers of Delhi.  
  
Hope this helps.

Narsing Rao
