Gaandhara Gandham Hingu



Hingu in Sanskrit or asafetida in English or kayam in Tamil/Malayalam is a vegetable product. It comes from the bark of a plant mostly grown in Afganisthan or Kandahar orGandhara.. Gaandhari was the daughter of a Gaadhara king and wife of Dhritarashtra.Gandha refers to both the taste and smell. Because of the intensity of its smell and tasteit is diluted with rice flour and sold in the market.



I am wondering whether the name of the country Gaandhara has come from the wordGandha of Hingu which is the main product of that country.
