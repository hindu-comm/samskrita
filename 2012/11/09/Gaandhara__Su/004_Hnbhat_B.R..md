I think Mr. Ramakrishnan is good at deducing something strange with his knowledge of Sanskrit and his wide General knowledge. He could derive all the English words from Sanskrit in his own way. So there is nothing strange if he can deduce गान्धार from गन्ध taking it to mean the fragrance specific to Hingu and the origin of the product Hindu in Kandahar, and its analogy with गन्ध+हार \> गान्धार in his own way derived.

  

I have attached a pdf file on the region called गान्धार as per the शब्दकल्पद्रुमः

  

गान्धमृच्छतीति गान्धारः - is the derivation grammatically given.

  

The remaining part could be guessed from the meaning of Gandha + its existence in Hingu + Hingu the product of Aphganistan.

  

I don't think we can find any such reference helping to identify the location today or anything the like.

  

गान्धार is one of the सप्त स्वर-s, which also conveniently be related to Aphghans - Kandahar - गान्धार according to Ramakrishnan.

  

Mm. has confused the word with गन्धर्व which is specific and different in meaning relating to the class of semi-gods according to the Amara,
living in the celestial religion . It may be hard to relate with Kandhar. Or there is one राग in music गान्धार which may be elated to Kandhar. Anything possible with guessing and analogy to establish the supremacy of Sanskrit language over other languages.
