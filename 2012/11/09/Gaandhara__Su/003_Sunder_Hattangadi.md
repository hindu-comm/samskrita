The following references would be enough to refute any connection of gAndhAra to Hingu!! (from M-W Dict.



गन्धर्व  
(H1) गन्धर्व \[p= 346,1\] \[L=63278\] m. a गन्धर्व \[though in later times the गन्धर्वs are regarded as a class , yet in RV. rarely more than one is mentioned ; he is designated as the heavenly गन्धर्व (दिव्य्/अ ग्° RV. ix , 86 , 36 and x , 139 , 5), and is also called विश्वा-वसु ( RV. x , 85 , 21 and 22 ; 139 , 4 and 5) and वायु-केश (in pl. RV. iii , 38 , 6) ; his habitation is the sky , or the region of the air and the heavenly waters ( RV. i , 22 , 14 ; viii , 77 , 5 ; ix , 85 , 12 ; 86 , 36 ; x , 10 , 4 AV. ii , 2 , 3) ; his especial duty is to guard the heavenly सोम ( RV. ix , 83 , 4 and 85 , 12) , which the gods obtain through his intervention ( RV. AV. vii , 73 , 3 ; cf. RV. i , 22 , 14) ; it is obtained for the human race by इन्द्र , who conquers the गन्धर्व and takes it by force ( RV. viii , 1 , 11 and 77 , 5) ; the heavenly गन्धर्व is supposed to be a good physician , because the सोम is considered as the best medicine ; possibly , however , the word सोम originally denoted not the beverage so called , but the moon , and the heavenly गन्धर्व may have been the genius or tutelary deity of the moon ; in one passage ( RV. ix , 86 , 36) the heavenly गन्धर्व and the सोम are identified ; he is also regarded as one of the genii who regulate the course of the Sun's horses (i , 163 , 2 ; x , 177 , 2 ; cf. 135 , 5) ; he knows and makes known the secrets of heaven and divine truths generally (x , 139 , 5 and 6 AV. ii , 1 , 2 ; xx , 128 , 3 VS. xi , 1 ; xxxii , 9) ; he is the parent of the first pair of human beings , यम and यमी ( RV. x , 10 , 4) , and has a peculiar mystical power over women and a right to possess them ( RV. x , 85 , 21 and 22 ; 40 and 41) ; for this reason he is invoked in marriage ceremonies ( AV. xiv , 2 , 35 and 36) ; ecstatic states of mind and possession by evil spirits are supposed to be derived from the heavenly गन्धर्व (cf. -गृहीत , -ग्रह) ; the गन्धर्वs as a class have the same characteristic features as the one गन्धर्व ; they live in the sky ( RV. AV. S3Br. xiv) , guard the सोम ( RV. ix , 113 , 3 S3Br. iii AitBr. i , 27), are governed by वरुण (just as the आप्सरसs are governed by सोम) S3Br. xiii A1s3vS3r. x , 7 , 3, know the best medicines ( AV. viii , 7 , 23 VS. xii , 98), regulate the course of the asterisms ( AV. xiii , 1 , 23 BhP. iv , 29 , 21 ; hence twenty-seven are mentioned VS. ix , 7), follow after women and are desirous of intercourse with them ( AV. S3Br. iii) ; as soon as a girl becomes marriageable , she belongs to सोम , the गन्धर्वs , and अग्नि ( Gr2ihya1s. ii , 19 f. Pan5cat. Sus3r. ) ; the wives of the गन्धर्वs are the आप्सरसs (cf. गन्धर्वा\*प्सर्/अस्) , and like them the गन्धर्वs are invoked in gambling with dice ( AV. vii , 109 , 5) ; they are also feared as evil beings together with the राक्षसs , किमीदिन्s , पिशाचs , &c , amulets being worn as a protection against them ( AV. Sus3r. ) ; they are said to have revealed the वेदs to वाच् ( S3Br. iii ; cf. Pa1rGr2. ii , 12 , 2), and are called the preceptors of the ऋषिs ( S3Br. xi) ; पुरूरवस् is called among them (ib.) ; in epic poetry the गन्धर्वs are the celestial musicians or heavenly singers (cf. RV. x , 177 , 2) who form the orchestra at the banquets of the gods , and they belong together with the आप्सरसs to इन्द्र's heaven , sharing also in his battles ( Ya1jn5. i , 71 MBh. Hariv. &c ; cf. RTL. p.238) ; in the more systematic mythology the गन्धर्वs constitute one of the classes into which the higher creation is divided (i.e. gods , manes , गन्धर्वs AV. xi , 5 , 2 ; or gods , असुरs , गन्धर्वs , men TS. vii , 8 , 25 , 2 ; cf. S3Br. x ; or gods , men , गन्धर्वs , आप्सरसs , सर्पs , and manes AitBr. iii , 31 , 5 ; for other enumerations cf. Nir. iii , 8 Mn. i , 37 \[ RTL. p.237\] & iii , 196;vii , 23 ; xii , 47 Nal. &c ) ; divine and human गन्धर्वs are distinguished ( TUp. ii , 8 ; the divine or देव-गन्धर्वs are enumerated MBh. i , 2550 ff. and 4810 ff.) ; another passage names 11 classes of गन्धर्वs ( TA1r. i , 9 , 3) ; the chief or leader of the गन्धर्वs is named चित्र-रथ ( Bhag. x , 26) ; they are called the creatures of प्रजापति ( Mn. i , 37) or of ब्रह्मा ( Hariv. 11793) or of कश्यप (11850) or of the मुनिs ( MBh. i , 2550 Hariv. 11553) or of प्राधा ( MBh. i , 2556) or of अरिष्टा ( Hariv. 234 VP. i , 21) or of वाच् ( PadmaP. ) ; with जैनs the गन्धर्वs constitute one of the eight classes of the व्यन्तरs\]

Would like to know the relevant portion from the Rigveda regarding this.

I think the name of the country comes from the mythological celestial beings, gAndharas, who were good musicians. They also had a good fragrance. The country is mentioned in the Rig-Veda.

Gaandhara Gandham Hingu



Hingu in Sanskrit or asafetida in English or kayam in Tamil/Malayalam is a vegetable product. It comes from the bark of a plant mostly grown in Afganisthan or Kandahar orGandhara.. Gaandhari was the daughter of a Gaadhara king and wife of Dhritarashtra.Gandha refers to both the taste and smell. Because of the intensity of its smell and tasteit is diluted with rice flour and sold in the market.



I am wondering whether the name of the country Gaandhara has come from the wordGandha of Hingu which is the main product of that country.
