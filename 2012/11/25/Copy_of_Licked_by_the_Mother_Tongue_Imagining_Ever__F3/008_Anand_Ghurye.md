Dear Friends ,  
  
I read the original 15 page article .  
  
What I understand the author to be saying is this ( correct me if I am wrong )  
  
1.Samskrita Bharati have their own ideas about the form and purpose of Samskrita . The purpose is to use it as day to day language .  
  
2.This form of Samskrita proposed is close to other Indian langauages .  
  
3 It is possible to speak Sanskrit without knowing it .  
  
4.Samskrita Bharati attempts to remove the belief that Sanskrit is language of High level literature and Elite People .  
  
5. Samskrita Bharati attempt to project an image that in India of the past there was homogeneity of language and all and sundry could speak Samskrita and so could we now .  
  
  
A similar attempt is made in Mumbai by one Professor Kokate as concerns points 1 , 2 and 3 above . It has been around for over 40 years now . He promises to teach Spoken English in one lecture to students of 10 th standard level . His medium of teaching is Marathi .  
  
He proceeds thus . I go . I go to school . I go to school by walking . The sentence goes on increasing to infinity . All the participants loudly recite . Then he tells them to go home and make sentences based on this structure .  
  
Till today I am yet to meet even one person who has learnt spoken english through this course . Even in the school where we introduced Prof. Kokate we came out cropper . I do not know why but this approach at least in case of Kokate does not seem to work . It seems that the fear of English as language goes away in the first lecture but within days one reaches the glass ceiling of this approach which is quite low . and then one stops all efforts to learn it further .  
  
Regards ,
