the samskrita vyavahara sahasri can be obtained from the following links

  

<http://hinduebooks.blogspot.com/2009/10/samskrita-vyavahara-sahasri-1000.html>  

  

or

  

<http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2010/01/one-thousand-sentences-for-conversation.html>  

  

  

As you rightly said it is just a book of simple sentences. If the author has spent his "precious" time in psycho-socio-analysis (a debunked methodology) of this book, he could have spent his time better. I hope the author also endeavours another article psycho-analyzing the french revolution on the basis of french nursery rhymes.

  

The author "sees" lot of things that others dont even worry about ("utopian past", "utopian future", "return to archaic", "center of authority", "divergence from classical sanskrit" etc). While most students indeed learn samskritam "hope to find something they lost", the author's tone is panicky about that, can't understand why.

  

Bhartrihari has already described better. Nothing much to add.
