Dear Friends

This article seems to be based on a current "politically correct" sociological analysis of class, society, gender, etc, of Samskrita Bharati's phrase book . The phrase book is simply a tool for learning a language, and gives examples of common sentences, not a political statement of how things ought to be in a sociological context. So this sort of analysis for such a learning tool is inappropriate, in my view.
The reader can easily change the genders if so desired, and women can say things attributed to men in the book, and vice versa. It is no big deal. The fact that at present station workers do not speak Sanskrit is neither here nor there. The purpose of the book is just to teach you sentences which could be said in different everyday contexts.



SB is doing an excellent job - the only way to learn to any language is to use it everyday in daily speech to communicate everyday thoughts, and to learn it as Sanskrit right from the start as a child would learn its own language, starting with simple constructions, and not through a another language. This is the proven to the be the best way of learning any language, so SB is on firm well-proven educational theory and practice. If you want to learn French for example this is the best model.



Also the authors conclusion seems to be based on a number of wrong assumptions. First it is assumed that Sanskrit is a liturgical language and SB is laicizing it by giving it an everyday context. This is not the case. Sanskrit is a language first and foremost - its precursor, the Vedic language, was used for hymns. The Vedic language of course is still used for ritual and religious purposes to-day. But even in Vedic times the language was used in a non-religious secular way for communication etc. There are words for weaving, pottery, different grains, vessels for cooking , types of dishes etc. Later on there was a vast secular literature in classical Sanskrit - the Arthasastra, the Kama sutra the Vedangas and all the poetry and plays - to name a few.
Hence SB is not laicising anything - the everyday use was there from the beginning, and it due to the great versatility of the roots in Sanskrit that completely new concepts (such as the internet) can be expressed in Sanskrit. It is the same for Latin - it was a pan-European liturgical language but also a language used for ordinary communication as any schoolboy who has learnt Latin knows (Cave chaps - here comes the beak!). People learn Sanskrit for its own sake - because it is such interesting classical language which has correlates not only in the Indian languages but all the other Indo-European languages, and not necessarily because they want to learn the Vedic hymns of the punditas - which by the way, is not the same as the classical language which is
taught by SB, although the author is confusing the two (another mistake in the paper). Hence Sanskrit is "worth learning" not only
because of the Vedic hymns (the author thinks this the only reason for learning Sanskrit, also a mistaken assumption) . It takes a few more years of study to come to grips with the grammar of the Vedic language, so you can't jump from straight from classical Sanskrit to Vedic.



I am intrigued by the author's first name - Is he seeing himself as first in a line of luminary Hastings coming after him?



BTW is SB's phrase book available on-line?

### Abstract

*This paper examines the ways in which Sanskrit revivalists in contemporary India imagine social contexts for the production and reproduction of Sanskrit speech. In contrast to the received view of Sanskrit as being a ritual language*par excellence,*opposed at every step to the domestic sphere and everyday life, Sanskrit revivalists treat Sanskrit as a “mother tongue,” figuring the home as the primary site for the creation of an “everyday Sanskrit” world and the mother as the primary agent of this process of Sanskritizing the domestic sphere. “Domesticating Sanskrit,” the process of bringing the elevated ritual language down into everyday life, at the very same time “Sanskritizes the domestic,” that is, ritually transforms or elevates the home into a “Sanskrit home.” Moving outward from the Sanskritized domestic sphere, activists also imagine other contexts in which one could use Sanskrit, which nonetheless conforms to a notion of a Sanskrit interiority or domesticity.* \[India, Sanskrit, language revival, mother tongue, middle class, ritual\]

Every few months in India, and this is especially true nowadays around the first week of August—which was officially declared “Sanskrit Week” by the Indian Government in 2001—there is a newspaper or magazine story about some household which has decided to speak nothing but Sanskrit at home. These stories usually frame the event as a curiosity, as an index of one family's peculiar, if nothing else, impassioned devotion to a language which no one really speaks anymore and has not, in fact, for centuries in any extensive capacity. What makes speaking Sanskrit at home “newsworthy” stems largely from the many associations Sanskrit carries: as the elite “classical” language of South Asia, the language of ancient literary and ritual practice, and subjected to such focused and deliberate cultivation so as to make it virtually artificial.[¹](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en1 "Link to note")

This “domestic sanskrit” is only one of many reframings of Sanskrit. As I argue in the larger work of which this is a portion, different engagements with Sanskrit, and particularly within the horizon framed by the European “discovery” of Sanskrit, have led to the development of different Sanskrit objects—the philologist's Sanskrit, the nationalist's Sanskrit, the pandit's Sanskrit, etc.—which are nonetheless all contained within the referent “Sanskrit” as used to denote a language, in the sense of an abstract system of lexico-grammatical structure—Saussurian*langue*. However, if we are to follow the Russian literary theorist Bakhtin and take a truly dialogic approach to language—and I believe we ought to—then none of these Sanskrits are entirely separate from the others. Each is a palimpsest of prior and subsequent uses, utterances, and contexts, each word and phrase redolent of a host of other associations—each reveals a “sideward glance” at the other “Sanskrits.”

Traditionally regarded as the language of the gods,*deva*![inline image](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gPriEq9satjsyGya105o0diekShIpnGOAHaK9RcCgpdNjnLaWWxwI4TFvgdJCgX0xAApOqtEys0LLqRsQyhxeI4HRuteJ9-ZJ4Gwxh_PwfnJN_yFvvI0GY8joLdW-Tbx24ye3jd_V2eHHHG_Y_vDwKjbBgjsevWZ0vUIJZD0wNBhVxCGRQGmFlr-kj_TYNMwaB7gFNDlYbEMhJSWaI1TxHQwmamuTnlr7xyFxujR3ccEe4teAj6wnpsLNGpMWOpaauQADJznmOCvQg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu1.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1bd&s=1b024d6027d378f13cc215e6385a8a354484e805), Sanskrit stood for centuries in the South Asian subcontinent, and beyond, into Central and Southeast Asia, as the model language for knowledge production, literary composition, and ritual performance. Even when those functions were later replaced by local vernaculars (see especially[Pollock 2006](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b42 "Link to bibliographic citation")), Sanskrit continued to exert enormous power as the ideal model. The elaborate Indian traditions of grammatical analysis and ritual hermeneutics emerge out of a concern ultimately with the preservation, transmission, and correct use of Sanskrit, since the very efficacy of world-making ritual action relies upon the proper pronunciation and employment of the language. Thus, even in its heyday, Sanskrit is a code restricted to certain highly regimented contexts—hardly prosaic conversation. So what happens when one decides to take a language defined largely by its non-domestic and ritual character and make it the language of domestic, everyday conversation? One of the points I want to make in this paper is how, despite this seeming reversal of valencies, the framing of Sanskrit as a domestic, everyday language relies on precisely the kinds of ritual associations and transformative powers Sanskrit has long carried. As we will see, domesticating Sanskrit, in fact, is based on a series of performative, ritual acts of re-baptizing the everyday with Sanskrit.

Many households which have undertaken such an effort are involved with one of the primary organizations behind the so-called Sanskrit revival movement, Samskrita Bharati.[²](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en2 "Link to note")Samskrita Bharati was founded in 1981, originally as the Sanskrit wing of the Hindu Seva Pratishthanam, a volunteer organization based in Bangalore and affiliated with the Hindu nationalist organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (“National Organization of Volunteers,” RSS). Samskrita Bharati's charismatic leader, Ca. Mu. Krishna Shastry (Cā.

He claims that Sanskrit once was the language of “all Indians” irrespective of caste, class, regional origin, or religion, and it should be so again. A common spoken language with a vast literary heritage should ameliorate all the problems which beset modern India.

In what follows, I examine Samskrita Bharati's efforts to imagine contexts for the social reproduction of everyday Sanskrit practice. As I stated above, the basic goal on their part is to create a nation of Sanskrit speakers, (re-)creating a national unity for India through common linguistic practice. Despite the ecumenical rhetoric about Sanskrit being “all Indians'” primordial linguistic heritage, it is a vision of a national past and future closely tied to that espoused by other Hindu nationalist organizations. As I argue throughout, since “everyday Sanskrit” is largely a creation of Samskrita Bharati and associated revivalist groups, there is a marked absence of any actual contexts in which one*would*speak Sanskrit. Therefore, a great deal of energy is focused on creating or imagining contexts where one*could*speak it. The majority of my discussion, then, focuses on models for how to implement everyday Sanskrit conversations, rather than on observations of actual practice (or lack thereof).[³](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en3 "Link to note")I should also note here that labeling this Sanskrit as “everyday” follows the practice of Samskrita Bharati and is not my own terminology. While clearly bearing some relationship to the notion of “everyday life” in modern Western thought (and as analyzed by Simmel, Lefebvre, de Certeau, and others),[⁴](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en4 "Link to note")it is here used primarily by Sanskrit revivalists to mark explicitly the opposition to customary associations of Sanskrit with decidedly non-everyday activities like ritual performance.

In the first part of this paper, I examine the framing of the household as the central node from which Sanskrit practice emanates. Along with centralizing the household in their attempt to produce organic contexts for the production of a Sanskritized domesticity, Samskrita Bharati focus on the mother as the primary agent of this process, investing the term “mother tongue” with a deep significance. However, as I have noted already, I show how the endeavor to transform Sanskrit from a language associated with (masculine) priestly authority and ritual practice into one of (feminine) domesticity depends on the very authority and practices from which they are trying to divorce it. In the second part, I look at a small phrasebook published by Samskrita Bharati, the![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/h5bve191eyhiB5uQFWEHVNulP9qtzw7yORuU3UUfcZOSD-W2x4pF6DY6fmrTqmQIj4RNUolQqn4ytXmbP6KU5a8p7RoG_fffsIQzRHa2HQw6qlle0CM2vT8lkAUfz7-CU-zuIxZW2NTURaCVDjmATqKJwcdIC9lHYH44T273_wX4J5Vz3fkZMx5kwcPhHFHPuC4b4nJNGVlT597fWOMI4Sf-VyYf0vW_aKIisCc5-zcrQqZMLQmF0FdtA5F88Lg4BCgrHrfWcWJ3eA=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu3.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1bo&s=bc6ca501a4b794c62d595e77fa12e53bf4fd7b2f)(“A Thousand Practical Sanskrit \[Sentences\]”), which contains a number of sample utterances in Sanskrit, organized topically around various everyday contexts. As I show, reading this phrasebook as presenting a particular point of view reveals an iconic model for Samskrita Bharati's imagination of what constitutes both the domestic basis for a Sanskritized world, as well as ideal speakers.

### There's No Place Like Home

A couple of months into my work in India, I had the opportunity to attend what promised to be a momentous event, organized in conjunction with Samskrita Bharati. For two days in late December, several hundred men and women—Sanskrit revivalists from all over southern India—gathered in Shimoga, Karnataka, for the “South Indian Sanskrit House Festival” (![inline image](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UguFA22XJqPaAckMX6C13C7xoWf09nfwqACIHmnN80E1-ppdfMAtRyDb5SVtMopzZ4jheHwPz8dLbooDF71EhPqWAitQ-rk4JnJGvC-ak_urUq_u_lvVPGUvQOBLG-vtnK2a4XWG57mQKBmrA-C7FG_7uqNIzUwlJ2sxJf3l5kMlBmA9wQ2qyx4l4Am7P1A5nAJmVc8QgfwTHUgp_k9Q7imPCIMGVx2P-Q-ZSVU6ls4OUaN7ZyEo7190Ve3c4p40_cJsv_-hFaBl-g=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu4.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1br&s=a0f2694088a5d17809c3e730d4d801cc3be8475e)). In a bilingual Sanskrit-Kannada pamphlet announcing the festival, there were several stated objectives for the event:

· • 

the maintenance of the “mother-tongue-ness”\[![inline image](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Fw5XxgtBTQXDXkuUXr3nxZpOg6b1Q10ksjzCmJbtTN42xMRBO9j_gA3CCjW34nLCQ2kYIui0Sk6l8hiAHsAezFuqGnmNcVEijIlQFJg0vixBTbBws9g3YsMzvMUOBQ4ddpwRUs3hjFW9tmjtoWiYZA9Xnzbg3_PPWpAEvqxVO1VFbtpDXNjb4emLEzjyKKP9f_lI-EcG_dtbaDZFKOhNWLYJCC5_FmzlcMO6FZfOe0fASKzBx9513k_GbNnLvZyKRLmxUKOGJZ9zrA=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu5.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1bs&s=f18b3c54e52a7aa96a30fcaabec5a2c15bb9dc9d)\] of Sanskrit by means of Sanskrit households

· • 

the preservation of the best \[parts\] of Sanskritic life through Sanskrit

· • 

increasing efforts toward producing a new vitality among Sanskrit families

· • 

the promotion of a Sanskrit mother-tongue tradition

· • 

the overall furthering of the \[Sanskrit\] conversation movement \[[![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/WfpsnReE9I3UlYLykp4_BbRaIqk_5EAzrDyIJYBydijAmD36nLgILzP-hf8kPBvjh7Sxue4K6dV27LUgCnfe9IQvvtdxAtXT4QoHQzFNIwdia58FfdWA8tY_ROsZD0twM_hN-vNio4nm3wv7z_0bVMKa1HF75of3HoOd9zh5C9BB_ApovNHYZZ8gcwChxwm9-GrB5BuJad36EXihcom1a4YWfI3ntkXtHYvZZP0N19tzZk82_nBvUa4OkTjZIuvLPNqKDCuZrH8sRg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu6.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1bu&s=bf04e37df24b90e6ee75f4a7ac385db2f10c12b3)2000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b52 "Link to bibliographic citation"):2\]

The festival served as yet another marker in a definitive shift in strategy by the Sanskrit revivalists that had been ongoing for the past several years. Initially, their program was comprised of two primary components: the kind of Sanskrit promoted and the manner in which it was taught. Samskrita Bharati promotes what it calls “simple Sanskrit,” which is a kind of regularized, lexically reduced form of the language (see[Hastings 2003b](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b26 "Link to bibliographic citation")for details). Many constructions and means of periphrasis are introduced to parallel those in modern Indian languages, so that, much like Molière's Monsieur Jourdain discovering that he had been speaking prose all his life, students of simple Sanskrit discover that they have been speaking Sanskrit all their lives. The primary forum for introducing simple Sanskrit is the conversation camp, a ten-day, Berlitz-style immersion program designed to get people speaking Sanskrit as quickly as possible.

While the Sanskrit conversation camps have garnered a great degree of public visibility for the Sanskrit revival movement, they have not generated as large and dedicated a following as Samskrita Bharati would hope. The organization has a host of follow-up activities for graduates of the introductory ten-day camps, but there is a substantial attrition rate after initial exposure in the camps. This problem arises largely out of the very nature of the camps and the Sanskrit taught in them: since every effort is made to create a bridge to Sanskrit by pointing out parallels and correlations between Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary, and that of either Hindi or the regional language, participants come away with the impression, as I already noted, that they have always been speaking something like Sanskrit. Thus, all one needs to do is to “Sanskritize” their speech in particular, marked ways.[⁵](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en5 "Link to note")Many feel after going through the conversation camps that they have sufficient knowledge of Sanskrit and discontinue their studies. This is despite the fact that Samskrita Bharati exerts large amounts of effort to encourage follow-up study. These efforts include advanced conversation and special topics courses, courses for children, various other outreach projects, and a number of workbooks, collections of stories, and other publications.[⁶](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en6 "Link to note")

It is with this in mind, then, that one of the main thrusts of the spoken Sanskrit movement currently is the encouragement of “Sanskrit households” (![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PuRw_0unjdxgNMWputX28Y-hl4kr4nlZjgv8qsIm54se-Y2Kh0h32kYfMivOm2Idyle_l-4fF2TZWNXyZ1aPnPrdPzKpmUZ0bVasGNq-cwy55IFuWuxlzL52yP_zpdwK7E3R5lSVt0mQowmPqsP87Lai4ckStShLHGIQDuEukxbqHq-kcRa32NHDygescw1Zr8xWB0WbPe0zkvOuIzMSLjtLgbfa2-ubfKGiKhUcS72FAQG84HbLPwpvtngZvtQ5s-jabeCy8JJLLg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu7.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1c1&s=544d5ae75e7ebec306cc8e0b4111ab25f3a2a89c)). While these have been a feature of the movement since its inception, efforts have only turned seriously toward this endeavor in the last ten years or so.

(The proclamation could just as easily have continued up the ladder, “*janapade janapade*,*pradeśe pradeśe*” (“in each district, in each region”) etc., etc.) Sanskrit households become a socially locatable and significant site for the production and reproduction of “Sanskrit speakers,” a deictic origo or ritual center from which the movement is to spread outward, but which are nevertheless to remain the central anchor for reference. As I will discuss shortly, it is through the domestication of Sanskrit in making it the language of the home that the ground is prepared for the Sanskritization of the world, ritually re-baptizing that world with Sanskrit.

The emphasis placed on the Sanskrit household follows largely from Samskrita Bharati's approach to language pedagogy, which is founded on the principle of immersion through conversation. “![inline image](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nuW85NKC3-6rvqYcsenNywm2GbY3_y56E0QHqBgytPpni-Tr5R-cY68EbIrQ7kVOw868xBQ3ldJYICQgkqQZZhI87my_OPlFWful29W1BofcDg7YE1TlnOdnFv-WKQEtq6j9s6k4cqPuISDTy7_DtL9rAV3oFSIyA3N6x8AtQqCnvdbksMEX1bs8tBoTbYvJ6VK91UF1MmEYKeTvnS3Ogo4B1zcwaDwHXsLzdyR6c9uN6bZSuWtLHb0ABO2J28PrlFlo4SZfno1A35I=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu12.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1c9&s=e86253781fd85b1125b39ec355d6d87931ace24f)” (“speech is the root of all”) declares one overview of the movement by its founder ([![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/1hYZBBRXwX1DAst-TIbIP9AFc6bXnpNZWOTohh3QNHCmPXY32HYt2RAq8rh0pwUHjc8Yv1F2SPsajBRLQoxgq8kfBszHVC5XoaAUyVLw8v_pzzOLGQIVu1VYL8mE9vRzqq3gSYqlGlSqg7n-n9XiQ0MRlIe0QIlf6synvbBVPf0O9Q5smLEwDZEEssC5DBx_eAJb3_FIyiYFuRTUlCkY1M-RwNOBw_Vmr-j_dQMpKzqOHKS9oIP5ZZJtjZXJrJrqgcyLFGx7dU66Clo=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu13.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1c9&s=2552723b5a2e399d57efde6d2c5116bb1f97855a)Śāstrī 2000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b35 "Link to bibliographic citation"):15), and it was a sentiment I heard voiced repeatedly: “If Sanskrit is going to be revived, it needs to be spoken.” The idea follows that listening and speaking skills must precede reading and writing; these stages are visualized as a series of consecutive steps toward mastery of the language (as diagrammatically represented by a staircase, e.g., in[![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/C8BrGyQPDMzrf0kZfunFnjU82tYClDa_MANKZC8rcsIKXDvpK-MwJ1Uj93mb6ma3vxl3MLOylk4CtVLx6nKUGawMacudzdIInGLprOtD2ZVsp3TlpROKIg029mrvF3rgDziKqgeL4ZLDkSAYPUHV7oiSzyloUkgoeqWRlHxiDTJiaMkampwfVxYUmFRvtNIgoyLncusmrTRloOUyRfa0r-dib24BrScfBocFlPWNt-vjgCUX1L9w_t86_Csf_lnzASP0Eg20vS6GUEw=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu14.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1cb&s=0759ac3d681daf4924126e35afddbba6ab0c1233)Śāstrī 2000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b35 "Link to bibliographic citation"):6). Now this may seem to be a fairly commonplace assertion, and certainly would make sense for a movement which is putatively engaged in a language revival effort. This model is, after all, an idealized version of the process people normally follow in first-language acquisition. But what we need to understand is what this pedagogical philosophy is raised in objection to. Samskrita Bharati attributes (with some justification) many of the problematic aspects of contemporary Sanskrit education to its instruction via the “Grammar Translation Method” (as in Classical language education)—by which they mean teaching the language through the medium of another—as opposed to the kind of program they advocate. In an English language pamphlet published by the organization, in a section on “Questions and Answers” about Sanskrit, they write:

> 
> > For more than hundred years \[*sic*\] the Grammar Translation Method > has been adopted from Primary to University levels. This is not the > Indian method. It is a foreign one. Samskrit was being taught through > Hindi or English or some other regional language. This is one of the > reasons why Samskrit reached such a sad situation. Therefore from the > Primary stage itself Samskrit should be taught only through the > Samskrit medium. \[[![inline > image](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/oa-JmwX4FZKgWvdjGGjY-Fbbv6GHfy6ohGB1fhqp8ySxQMnpHSnIgQffNrdzJ2gS8bRYIEKgVIjHTSUkggO69yT78ZFVQVwF713h1U5pOFnkwUpMNtYBqg4lygndNj_dQ_34sb3LduwOrFkm89S-LhzvPvmu8mRcQ-ktj9El7n03RNTLtvBeJPMpsoMNiwI87GX9UcP3q0PSFyToJeEi-e5nr4Z1kVDL6eeLGq62ZC4Wxgm4wAmjV1DwSr95mWWdfWnCR1U6kMmF8nI=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu15.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1ce&s=a39a067a41741e8c48a614fb6a95652f912cde31)Bhāratī > 1998b](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b50 "Link to bibliographic citation"):27–28\] >

Note the emphasis on the utter foreignness of Grammar Translation Method to the task at hand. Of course, one doubts if the so-called “Indian method” of teaching Sanskrit would satisfy the revivalists’ purposes, since perduring pandit traditions of Brahmanical Sanskrit instruction teach the language not through conversational immersion, but through rote memorization of texts. Rather, the method they wish to promote in place of this is one which they stipulate must have existed when the language was “formerly the language of everyday dealings”—and therefore must be the (true) “Indian method”: “Samskrit can be studied by repeatedly hearing and speaking, by aural means. Without reading any book, without reading grammatical rules, by oral practice alone one can learn Samskrit. So one must talk in Samskrit” ([![inline image](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ppUYozQMcObAlWzgLFvyxGjmvDXLmHCxlxax8ycubgxj8Cf3RKSC-LZNgKk1P8dExKGe8H76jIPU21SlUyCUHinUV-S6vsWRPpGbFVdhfGPYo2yDR8vGTY5fIHTVBPaZbWr1R7sE2mBrlQKmnLjxe-kdJJMIShpWgSbBKZeen6d82DhrgCtISFza3T4uRXSFS8FbU4-B5MEplqrNLTKgQz7wl69_r7gpV84upyE0Wiqyq-X60UQVjAJ8xDvtc7tvlWSw5MXQwDm5Dlg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu16.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1cg&s=6e06813b664f86965a85e21a6853351f23ea7665)Bhāratī 1998b](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b50 "Link to bibliographic citation"):3). The distinction Samskrita Bharati wishes to draw is summed up nicely with an aphorism repeatedly invoked in their literature and by the members: “Speak*in*Samskrit, not*about*Samskrit.” However, as we will see, the process of creating Sanskrit speech contexts proceeds precisely through*ritual*baptismal acts of translation.

The logic of the model of language instruction and acquisition employed by Samskrita Bharati demands that one hear and speak Sanskrit as much as possible, as often as possible. Part of the reason for focusing on the creation of Sanskrit homes is to establish contexts where that kind of immersive contact with the language can happen. Judging from the entire day's worth of testimonials at the Sanskrit House Festival by people who had declared their home a Sanskrit-speaking home, this has been a moderately successful strategy. Those of us in the audience heard time and again how speaking Sanskrit in the home gave the family members increased fluency in spoken Sanskrit and a renewed sense of purpose and devotion to the cause of the Sanskrit revival movement. As we will see, domesticating Sanskrit—transforming a ritual language into a language of everyday conversation—proceeds largely through a process of Sanskritizing the domestic, using Sanskrit's ritual powers to sanctify the home.

### The Sanskrit Household

The home is a particularly ideologically saturated site in India, as elsewhere, and has historically been constructed as a space for the production of national subjects and culture.[⁸](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en8 "Link to note")[Partha Chatterjee (1993](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b12 "Link to bibliographic citation")) has shown us the far-reaching repercussions of how in nationalist discourse in colonial India distinctions made and found between private and public, the inner and the outer, the home and the world, the spiritual and material, are recursively inscribed upon one another as a set of non-commensurable, mutually-entailing oppositions—a set of oppositions which find their ultimate expression in the opposition between the Orient and the Occident. Although the indexical ground has shifted somewhat, these oppositions perdure as significant conceptual and social categories in independent India.[⁹](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en9 "Link to note")According to![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/4lCDEf247-sLQvhw0sqr9cFKnSUgHepZRwPHGnCp0tVn4S7n3-cH6oBlvu-_-fg6So1J2ice_qCBlew1CI6hOR8_rNrKfynDxbmpiegfEq6fSRtHTmV2pKjGiTp1qlulmd527Np1uyD8Xqo6lTJq8lpK4GMavCOr5TWEdX6g4cn2dEi9usAH6E-NDHpHguC1G9493GQMphoMU1raNyCMKz428XPRY9Pfz-OHy2fELAJpAR3vX-pO-OhgbM7XYnP9aT64p8q-7l3jnHc=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu17.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1co&s=649ad98ec892e357d42a57e848f4d68ec6a16aca)Śāstrī, it is in the inner realm, the “private” spaces of the home that Sanskrit will thrive. In this view, the home is the affective domain, where emotions can be let loose.[¹⁰](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en10 "Link to note")It provides the most fertile environment for learning a language since it enables a context for unmediated and unselfconscious expression, a place where you can be your “true \[linguistic\] self.” Underwriting this assertion is a theory of language acquisition and linguistic practice where the powers of verbal expression proceed from the capacity for “general communication” (simple reference and predication), through the capacity for expressing thought or reasoning (logical argumentation), culminating in the capacity for the outward manifestation of emotions ([![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XA2gVNdhT4grRnIZGCbKXyfD-flImv-ufRpttPKtiD6tTVS-bw0S4bWtVejSdEf2K6Wc9Pc3lq9s8cRdRyzieXdCEjV8C5Jl5VhW-sqqsY7KueAsC4bd-X2wbNkVuZ-f8_2SOwhELaN_8G3PVV4Y99euUwUknV_JZ_dyoB2WBj_0TAVrb912lfjGhCc-nOb7RieRAwvYTHwIHkmCE8hXn4peYMLOC6p7cc-8ogyw-L4UJqUKAZ8UdrI23mNgwfPJLk4a--rjCoNURSE=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu18.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1cr&s=a611fdf33ecaed006d4fe6ef6430589f45201c4d)Śāstrī 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b34 "Link to bibliographic citation"):33).

The home is also crucially marked as a feminine domain, the realm of the wife, the mother.[¹¹](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en11 "Link to note")Here, Samskrita Bharati adopts a particularly loaded interpretation of the term “mother tongue” (![inline image](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ekLcv1HKvZ5hrsC4EdyGbMag2UMj7R63FMMuYKEx-V19In7X5gmQTg-ZWu3P5vC5KJQOqN-qw4lDTxjzz554StACPaR-WZzbRFa_3AbjQxQf4XJF22b7uHV-DGweekCw-ln_pDLnmMxi1bs6Uk7isVBqTTcwO-E1NYhzf_8UsMOHZcQMqzI_HzkzZ8anvCpkQwO9cw-tc8w-GYDbBXt4FYZwt2ocj9N1OLaw7ndoO_PuKtCAW5xHVQQXvden2xTyYA8NFo5v2mwHlgI=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu19.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1cs&s=0943d9aca3c61263121db3c47c0d1d8a8198c2e0)) by placing primary responsibility for “Sanskritizing” the house with the mother of a family. The term “mother tongue” is a European importation, current in India as a salient category only since the mid–19th century ([Mitchell 2005](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b39 "Link to bibliographic citation");[Ramaswamy 1997](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b44 "Link to bibliographic citation"):16). In this context it has a double sense. On the one hand, “mother tongue” is used in the sense enshrined in instruments of state governmentality (such as—most importantly—the census) as the language spoken in the home (whether by the mother or not). Actually, as defined and used in the decennial Indian Census, the term has had an illuminating semantic career. In 1881 and 1891, it was “the language ordinarily spoken in the household at each persons’ parents.” In 1901 it was the language each person “ordinarily used.” In 1911 and 1921 it was the language each person “ordinarily used in his own home.” In the three censuses from 1931 to 1951 it was the language “first spoken from the cradle.” In 1961 it was the language “spoken in childhood by the person's mother to the person or mainly spoken in the household.” From 1971 through 1991, it was defined as the language spoken in childhood by the person's mother to the person; if the mother died in infancy, then the language spoken in the person's home in childhood was recorded. However, Census officials note ([Census of India 2002](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b6 "Link to bibliographic citation")) that in collecting returns for the most recent censuses, language data was collected alternately under the rubrics “mother tongue,”“language ordinarily used,” and “parent tongue,” all of which produced “relatively consistent results.” What is important here is not that the term has been inconsistently applied from decade to decade, or that collection of language data has proceeded under several different labels, but rather that the term “mother tongue” has gone from meaning the language a person “ordinarily used” or used with their parents, to referring to the language actually “spoken by one's mother.” It has gone from a metaphorical usage of the term to a much more literal and gendered application. It should probably not be surprising, therefore, that Samskrita Bharati also employs the term with such a literal rendering.

On the other hand, particularly in speaking of Sanskrit, the term can have another sense, taking on a much broader meaning when linked to the familial metaphors employed in talking about historical linguistic relationships. “Sanskrit is the mother of all Indian languages” is a statement one encounters again and again in conversations about Sanskrit in India. While not technically precise as a description of linguistic genealogy in South Asia, it is nevertheless an accurate reflection of the functional relationship Sanskrit has to many modern Indian languages (as a source for lexical and generic innovation and*renvoi*), as well as—and this is perhaps more important—construals of that relationship. What statements like this represent are a transference of the metaphor inherent in the*Stammbaum*or “family tree” model of schematizing historical linguistic relationships to Sanskrit, positing an essentialized identity for it as a “mother tongue.”[¹²](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en12 "Link to note")When we combine this with the not-unrelated interpretation of “mother tongue” as the language spoken by a mother, we end up with a parallel analogy: as a mother teaches her children a language (and Sanskrit, at that), so does “mother” Sanskrit impart itself to its “daughter” languages. We could say, then, that the usage of “mother tongue” with respect to Sanskrit is highly overdetermined, and Samskrita Bharati's usage of the term “mother tongue” with reference to Sanskrit deliberately exploits this.

Of course, as I mentioned above, this usage of “mother tongue” is not merely an invocation of the figure of the mother. In a parallel fashion to the usage of the term in the Indian Census, the term links Sanskrit language usage not just to a maternal image or metaphor, but materially and practically to the role of the mother herself in propagating Sanskrit.

This profile goes on to introduce the accounts of a number of women who are described as “some mothers who have been speaking Sanskrit to their children.”

Here, in the image of the household of the Sanskrit-speaking family, we see the union of women and Sanskrit, figures who at least since the earliest Orientalist writings in the late 18th century have been united as the twin conservators of Hindu tradition ([Sangari 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b46 "Link to bibliographic citation")): Sanskrit as the verbal, textual clothing of dharmic law and religion; women as the custodians and symbols of that tradition, opposed, of course, to the traditionally masculine world of pandits and priests.[¹³](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en13 "Link to note")In nationalist mythologies in India, feminine and maternal figures play prominent roles in the iconography of the nation, although it is always as mothers and wives to male patriots. Women, as the symbolic representatives of the inner, domestic realm become figured as the space upon which tradition and culture rest; by a kind of building-block, or recursive, imagination, they become metonyms for the nation. Efforts for cultural improvement or conservation of tradition then end up focusing energies on women and the domestic sphere. Take for example,[Amanda Weidman's (2003, 2006](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b59 "Link to bibliographic citations")) work on the “classicalization” of South Indian (or Carnatic) music in Tamil Nadu, where she shows how women were sited as a locus for cultural improvement through schooling in Carnatic music, with the idea that domestic accomplishments in the home would radiate outward to the society at large.

In the same essay on the Sanskrit household,![inline image](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZHS9KMER4RDvuduzWgja7ux9uFbjoT5NSo5n8zBn5QQ-7hF1pP54NTH_78TwATyW_JQIMp9nEyr4CkNSjtauXNpJMid096saHURFVomXpxzF2F-rv3CIweiiRKtdRymSZqurAMhECrfSH9MI45RNEUYFNiQ9sWHqiVhk7Grt7q3UiGlckOLtgqSFe-Ge87C7zT6KlElQPBmvD_VIpxDkUa9ncXJh3SyZa55WPWwY7wpyjYAn8CTuwfjHd6jRb95fpHLTgTmsoKsYon4=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu29.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1db&s=1bc4020a3a978b7b255a3e3210e44fc11dee16ef)Śāstrī offers a variety of scenarios about how one can go about inculcating Sanskrit usage at home. Almost all the means to Sanskritize the house involve the coincident interconnection—the reflexive calibration—of speech and action.[¹⁴](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en14 "Link to note")By reflexive calibration, I mean that the speech, uttered at the same time as the action, characterizes or names the event, for example, “This is a stick up” announces a bank robbery (a “stick up”) by naming it. Sometimes, of course, the speech can be the action itself, as in explicit primary performatives, “I hereby pronounce you man and wife.” In any case, the desired effect we have to imagine is that while doing things around the house, one is at the same time producing a continuous narrative of what one is doing. “Whatever is to be done in the home should be done while uttering the expression connected to that (*tatsambandhi*),”![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/TcPeeyOhbj1B-H67Le-bhOSjc9F4K_wRNv2SB3jcGSrczG4EBrGCbB2qLV0ApBBAlZLGEWQltsmhZCxlYzSs6fE4fkPx70bIQ-Flaq85OQuK3SsEWodpPVasjs2PAWghMyeAEGhceJX9CqoH1WZA9SGrda_bDnmyiFPqxzNege1XhrqLs0VBqSyYoGu5cTNjzzHYkjh2A3DiO9fgkyzy6UZ5Uli_1rPWZTV9VIuyMV9csKfx-cw3Jo1UgGmtqfFVQf34bnqonCgr8r0=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu30.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1dd&s=a6ae06da3e201719438e56a10037e111be2217ae)Śāstrī writes. “Thus when a mother says, ‘I am setting down the pot,’ she should be setting down the pot” ([![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/HCY3oLd3KvUxhTU_qaRkUBItdmlnq7PLNU3ZWzP8bWfJB2lp76rg-QqApbxSoeNZuGbMGxuojbFCGDcRRoULXRGagDiXqjAwEx7r1jd3GkHSN3i3FCIEpbSAs99AFHrtfsrCRb0I2ttnWGuAv-NFscFV4200TCZCdKqKkMQ_-wnr2ah_mN3-NwVPweLgiKhHnCFoaTJ9CdDBOSPDLLzlUytT2uX30PDKVMWdwOX65p5mSKLQ1ksFOtjYBqkbwoFlAoW9UFHg9cJ_pEk=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu31.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1dd&s=b8d578610d1edf31c989f93ca0187803465d2120)Śāstrī 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b34 "Link to bibliographic citation"):36).[¹⁵](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en15 "Link to note")What is striking here is the parallelism to orthodox Brahmanical ritual practice (and ritual practice more generally), which similarly dictates a certain reflexive calibration between speech, action, and material objects, in order to produce and enact connections which serve to mediate the mundane and divine realms and make ritual meaningful. In this tradition of ritual performance,*bandhu*s (bonds) are believed to govern the interconnection of the various domains (worldly, godly, ritual) which enable action in the ritual sphere to be a means of establishing and maintaining mundane–divine relations. Objects, actions, and phrases in the ritual are declared as consubstantial representations of divine beings and qualities, and their manipulation enables mediation of the two worlds.[¹⁶](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en16 "Link to note")With the Sanskrit household, the calibration of speech and action in effect creates an everyday Sanskrit by lifting ordinary reference and predication to ritual effect.

The narration of activities in Sanskrit creates a translational equivalence which allows the subsumption of those activities into a Sanskritized domestic realm: as this activity was formerly done in my “Kannada world,” by describing it in Sanskrit I claim it for my “Sanskrit world.” This is achieved by what[Tambiah (1985](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b57 "Link to bibliographic citation")) would call a “persuasive analogy,” which carries a certain illocutionary force through the effective establishment of correspondences and relations of equivalence. In setting up and enacting relations of equivalence, these acts have a high degree of (poetic) metricality and enable the ordination of a new, Sanskritized domestic space. Thus, by performatively narrating a Sanskrit everyday life, one is able to*ritually*create it, phrase by phrase, action by action, suffusing the household space and the objects in it with the emanation of Sanskrit.

Of course, it is not just actions which are brought into translational equivalence, but objects as well. In addition to calibrating speech and action for the Sanskritization of the home,[![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/RA2QokSgWMfIYrK9m-9YtbEWlrEhOHntMrGLcWRwVcquxdN24x3PdBn4fzlDguJuJyQfgNOLU7jawKd79zPOtChq29nFcTKgypD0T6X58Taa58QBgt1_5z4aKqnkEeA-73B-mZyhvVyiJyK7DZS043Bcp2nZ2ndpbp81DltOdsyvCY25aQORcoJHpAJ46IGwkAHM_T1ifry9s7v7BYvkDcAvSQQp3JwGKQs3N2MEP3zbxTP3GCZW7ImMfhSwXJTy56BJs8KiANWEp58=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu32.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1di&s=abf0a09062728316473afd02d6277d14e36b88bb)Śāstrī (1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b34 "Link to bibliographic citation"):35) recommends “writing a Sanskrit name and placing it on everything in the house.”[¹⁷](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en17 "Link to note")Here we see explicitly the creation of these sorts of translational equivalencies which have the performative effect of ritually transferring objects from a mundane domestic space to a “Sanskrit” one. Several Sanskrit houses I visited engaged in this practice, with a number of labels with Sanskrit words on notecards affixed to various household objects and implements. By giving the objects their Sanskrit name, and labeling them as such, they are brought into the Sanskit world. At the Sanskrit House Festival, there was a pavilion set up next to the recital hall where the event was taking place. The tent was filled with various modern everyday objects, displayed with attached labels indicating the appropriate Sanskrit word.

The overwhelming sense of the place was that here were objects from daily life, arranged and rebaptized for a Sanskritized world. An important objective with the spoken Sanskrit movement has always been to demonstrate the everyday utility and suitability for Sanskrit, and that necessitates the labeling of everyday objects with Sanskrit names.

According to Samskrita Bharati, there are a little more than thirty “Sanskrit households” in the city of Bangalore. Several of these are the families of the full-time workers at![inline image](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Sq1wUB5TSIM9tLkoLfYWE-YCwzQFOBnOL4k3QjrzCZFXa0Q9XVyty2JWxqXEqwxCf4JmH5JyXYAXIUOJuLKIBcZxACzIiKtg7DYAbpYlpwf_llJ6AGkaPHRj52P6lKm-lZ7xNeYbJ3BqKtCImpNGEHKj8U9ye-i24mbAxp_FDdx7WcyMk7MDliMWZekAo-ZUTubcdLzL2iV8BDHoXOeEd8PkZCbk_sRMDcvT4nbYJw9gVIgMt9DMoCBRFvRV6if7qWI8vrOU5iZwhIA=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu37.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1do&s=7f96e8e2a6068363fdbdc839d735afe5d91d2d29), Samskrita Bharati's compound on the outskirts of the city, and it is my sense that for the most part Sanskrit is spoken as much as possible in these. However, in the remaining households designated as Sanskrit homes, actual Sanskrit use ranges from relatively to rarely, if at all. As I discovered, the designation of a household as a Sanskrit household is more of an optative expression of how things should or ought to be, rather than being indicative of a state of affairs. Granted, the adults and often the children in these homes all had some experience with Sanskrit, often through Samskrita Bharati's conversation camps, and of course there was a positive predisposition toward its use in everyday contexts. But as should be no surprise at this point, it is the designation—the naming—of a house as a*Sanskrit*house which is itself intended to bring it into being, as a ritually effective performative statement: “This house is a Sanskrit house.” Indeed, just as in ritual practice, the fact that one can Sanskritize a house without actually using Sanskrit all the time shows that even “everyday Sanskrit” still has a kind of ritual performativity such that actual, non-ritual, mundane practice*does not matter*.

Making Sanskrit the language of the home anchors it in a private domesticity from which it can venture forth into new domains of use. But by this very fact, the designation of a Sanskrit house is a public, outward-looking act—one that tranforms the private Sanskritness of the household into a public Sanskritness. Sanskrit households mark themselves in relation to all the other homes in the neighborhood, and do so literally: family members are advised to put up placards outside their residence advertising their home as one in which Sanskrit is spoken ([![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/yX8huVZ-5lYOaNUUbkbTPWSqVx-6mThI2cckirgXaHAKF_HtnKbj5q1dvsvuBFAdLUhBHudSvhlEWZGsopI_byTBMaGjRAcCEXdMMcGFyz_HVHgAPQmVABQPv0kfjppfDnEuaEF9s6PX4L0cONORVgZmsWvjLqwpxaMfDL8JzvNfGLzTO3aA_vDfTDqJFSKPmPTj-tNqGVXA-JVbVkYA_x5wogIMG2C-qgwomx6opmhW4qAyjnhJLV52vkILr1DAEnkSuvmNxXBFEvU=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu38.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1ds&s=6b19f43a18ba59d9603ae1ed72f96d268c4aa4a5)Śāstrī 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b34 "Link to bibliographic citation"):37). Just as labeling objects inside the the home with Sanskrit names enables the creation of a Sanskrit domestic world through translational equivalence, the naming and labeling of the house itself serves to encompass all the labels held within, as a meta-label of sorts. “This house and everything in it is a Sanskrit house.”

In publicly distinguishing themselves from their neighbors, Sanskrit households produce the possibility of further development—further converts to the cause. The mother in one household I visited held weekly evening Sanskrit camps for the neighborhood children. She claimed, with some obvious pride, that several parents had subsequently approached her inquiring about how they could start using Sanskrit in*their*home. By these means, Samskrita Bharati believes Sanskrit will spread out from the original domestic centers into new social realms and locales.![inline image](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LZYqT_0JDWOQXj_CyaCx9RUk6vNbpW8MMtlF3hYGIxZ3MRP5TxFKXEL0Z2_X8Jg4E1SG2zBd0QZeSU76c2_spsPaUPX5u_Nz_c9V9gJLdYaw4EMK9uixeoToEm9KeemSbMgbq6w8dQSe7cqx3mmdH4wn8tVEWk46Lfb1qb9UjyOnN41Jgpyk003DsFS3NB5iHXYBYaWImwt4obHDbS-uqwWzk1GOJnlbm9j54awJ2uRk4JxrLKdhjKO-Iu-Kg0_naVp4lmFSYLmA8fU=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu39.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1du&s=1ea1c69be84a9162a6b291da7383a38308a66c9c)Śāstrī writes, “For creating a new tradition of Sanskrit today, there is a need for every district in the whole country to have two or three model Sanskrit houses and to establish the customariness \[of that\]” ([![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/5OVdSEArNHJIZj6BwPtKUkSOoNDYzCRN-lT9NwZiI7-e_Y9MMQlur97OoLo4_QoiJccyzbCgIqgTstDnajH20g6IwL9xdo35ZbwHVAOEZ6xt7jGCXMnUFZU5lOr7mHrX22s621PdW93Ik584ONteAAvUsH_MfcDICRZSC_JvrbL1D3XM_1HLbMg9XNoj9KQ3XyNGfBh4LMKre37dCjhbtDINlM61Ejoo9aN7Cw7kUFyaauFw3BqJQuC3V6s2UDtNZas9WKS6p2gVISE=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu40.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1dv&s=74fb6306b60efc4917664917b28acb514e7a4d65)Śāstrī 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b34 "Link to bibliographic citation"):39).

In domesticating Sanskrit by making it the language of the house, Samskrita Bharati attempts to entirely decouple it from its prior context as an esoteric scholastic language and yoke it to new everyday contexts, producing a Sanskritized everyday life. While one can—and certainly from Samskrita Bharati's perspective ought to—speak and act in Sanskrit, it is not necessarily these facts which make the household a Sanskrit household. Rather, it is the baptismal act of labeling the house a Sanskrit house—an act which lays down the prototype (like all good ritual utterances) for the effective Sanskritization of the home.

### The Sanskrit Subject

Having now reviewed several selections from the![inline image](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/OoSMKl04GnjbD4RfMBhsIHIzNpO5V0vH8aeViWckdMHcTYaveS0HlMpnAo5Uz_1MarydDCSCYbkpHrvKJKvufJCX4AMFhEFfaY0UArz4YHfAaDocKcur81_J0wyVr9XBXDQ2yKIMEHq1pRaZN2i8wb28MpPMRIERekTgPKtiZ7cEXzUddDWWdGzIM5z_Lqky_000T1IHKrec1yG6Ijdi5iVLTjTaVQK7dWkyDsrfBRc__cd7C-5DhQKXqUpbHuU6fONeScSLi2p02Blr=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu189.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1j7&s=676e61fe5e02a630326eb8929830630a694917e5), we should consider the kind of user we can infer from this. Who is the Sanskrit-speaking subject whose world is diagrammed through the sections of this phrasebook? If we look back at some of the portions I have quoted, a definite picture begins to emerge. If the model world painted by the focus and arrangement of topics and verbal exchanges is representative of the sort of world inhabited by Sanskrit speakers, then it is one which is urban and it is what has increasingly come to be identified in India as middle class: married, office-types with children who are concerned about modern life, etc.

When applied to a group of people as a socioeconomic descriptor, the term “middle class” in India has historically been a code for Western-oriented or educated upper caste and urban elites ([Venkatachalapathy 2002](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b58 "Link to bibliographic citation")).[³⁰](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en30 "Link to note")In what was largely a two-class system, where the “middle class” was actually singled out, it was closely identified with the upper echelons of society. Middle class employment meant, usually, a civil service job, or at least a secure post in one of the nationalized industry and commerce sectors, such as banking. But since the early 1990s, following in the wake of a series of government policies aimed at large-scale economic liberalization, social scientists have begun to talk about a “new” Indian middle class, as Indian society is described as moving from a two-class society to one with a tripartite division ([Fernandes 2000b](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b18 "Link to bibliographic citation");[Rajagopal 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b43 "Link to bibliographic citation")), that is, from a society which is divided into rich and poor, or the haves and the have-nots, to one in which there are widely shared (if indeterminate) understandings that society is comprised of lower, middle, and upper classes.

Liberalization has enabled the lifting of many restrictions on imports, thereby allowing a greater range in the production and conspicuous consumption of goods, producing highly nuanced distinctions in status identities. Controls over state media have loosened, transforming the media landscape in India from state-controlled television to a plethora of local, regional, national, and international satellite channels that beam new images of global modernity into hundreds of thousands of Indian homes ([Fernandes 2000a](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b17 "Link to bibliographic citation")). The increased presence of multinational firms has created a new set of service-sector jobs in India, often related to electronics and information technology. But middle classness has its ambiguities, and the pressures to keep up appearances can sometimes be enormous. It can be an enormous source of frustration—frustration which Hindu nationalism has been able to tap, such that much of the core support for political parties like the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) come from these new middle classes ([Hansen 1999](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#b24 "Link to bibliographic citation")).

Read as a sort of interactional text, the![inline image](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/VcnXhDdDpNzDmPqzXuji0OtWKFsU2PmgBbQjtHLtcY0gfuFnMsHv3akNLyNBgRaheHE6WZVRk-klWt7VSBchNEMWIBvoMAVbCv9wte83cMdt649rZSFxbzf53PTz6h6rd7MGUhZKJ0_T4b-kY-wlRUJqAzVYxzR3HzG26IZg0dSdzL6F6VE6HLThDsz2pa0aZK9J1cg-2VUxelPqUxcqDTA35_uAuHibEsxtlnR3GtotC2Rm9gV976YaBfTdfgVU6QWb_h2zlmSzVf0p=s0-d-e1-ft#http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/store/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/asset/equation/JOLA_002_mu190.gif?v=1&t=h9xuy1jb&s=7d5d7ab2fb9df4142aa9ca5cfa88ca04acda9b40)creates a model Sanskrit world and Sanskrit speakers to inhabit it. In the Sanskrit sentences we have seen, everyday life is quite clearly figured as urban through such signs as the traffic jam. It is also certainly middle class. Household appliances, such as TVs and kitchen appliances, figure highly in many parts of the phrasebook. As we noted above, work is always “office” (i.e., white-collar) work.[³¹](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en31 "Link to note")For enjoyment, our Sanskrit speakers go to see plays and music recitals. They prefer buying things in shops with fixed prices to haggling in bazaars.[³²](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2008.00002.x/full#en32 "Link to note")And our speakers are focused on academic performance and examinations—those gatekeepers to employment in the professional sector.
