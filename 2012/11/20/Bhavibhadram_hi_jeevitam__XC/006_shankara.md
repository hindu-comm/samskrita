Bhat Sir,

  

Thanks a lot for a different interpretation of the verse and for the quotes from Valmiki Ramayana. This should make my friend very happy.  

  

Only after reading your reply, I remembered that I had used NSP edition of Dvisandhanakavyam for typing this sloka. In Bharatiya Jnanapith edition (from [jainlibrary.org](http://jainlibrary.org)) it is
'पलायन्त'. Attaching the relevant page for your perusal of its Sanskrit commentary. I could not understand it fully.  

  

regards  
shankara
