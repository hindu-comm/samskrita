Namaste!  
  
One of my friends has asked me to raise a query in this group on his behalf. He wishes to know the meaning of the quotation "भाविभद्रं हि जीवितम्" - Dvisandhana kavya of Dhananjaya chapter 9, verse 38. The verse is like this.  
  
कलत्रपुत्रमित्राणि गृहीत्वा तत्र ते जनाः ।  
यथायथं पलायन्ते भाविभद्रं हि जीवितम्॥  
  
I request learned members of this group to explain the meaning of this verse, especially of its last quarter.  


regards  
shankara
