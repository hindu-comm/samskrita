I think it is the reflection of the Ramayana verse ---

  

एति जीवन्तमानन्दो नरं वर्षशतादपि । (सुन्दरकाण्डः ३४/६).

२. विनाशे बहवो दोषा जीवन् प्राप्नोति भद्रकम् । (सुन्दरकाण्डः १३/४७)

  

जीवितं हि भावि भद्रम् -

  

If life is saved, at any time one can enjoy pleasure in future.

  

This seems the idea.

  

All fled with their families,

  

यदि जीवितं भावि, \[तदेव\] भद्रं हि --

  

If life is saved, that much is great great.

  

If one holds life, one can enjoy life in future. So they fled in all directions, as they find the way. यथायथं makes the sense.

पलायन्त should be the correct tense. But it is not typo error by shankar. The Nirnayasagar Press has got same reading.

  

पलायन्ते - can be justified as

  

"वर्तमानसामीप्ये वर्तमानवद्वा" as the direct report of the shower of the arrows fell, people fled away, as soon as the arrows of Lakshmana fell in Kishkindha, along with their children and family. If alive, they can live happily at any time in future.

  

Just had this idea, from the arthantaranyasa. as noted by the commentator in NSP edition.
