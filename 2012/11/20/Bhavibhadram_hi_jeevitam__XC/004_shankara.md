Mishraji,

  

You are right. पलायन्ते was a typo. I could not locate Nemichandra's commentary. Anyway, my doubt is now solved. Thanks for the explanation.



regards  
shankara

It is पलायन्त (they ran away) and not पलायन्ते (they run away).  
  
You may refer the Padakaumudi commentary of Nemichandra.  
  
The context is that people in Kishkindha/Saurashtra ran away taking their wife, children and friends, since life (जीवितम्) is but an auspicious (भद्रम्) future (भावि) - i.e. there is no life at all if the future is in uncertain or dangerous.
