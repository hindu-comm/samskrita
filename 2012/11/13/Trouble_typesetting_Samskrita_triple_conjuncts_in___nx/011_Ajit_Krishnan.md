namaste,



There are a few cases where the svaras are rendered in ways that I do not understand (i.e. I am suspicious about corruptions in way some svaras are rendered by traditional scholars). Havea look at <http://www.aupasana.com/file-cabinet/VedicAccents2.pdf>, starting from page 13. When these are looked at, as a whole, it certainly looks to be a corruption introduced over time.



IMO, what is printed should be what is correct. It should not be "what is chanted", regardless of whether this method of chanting is supported by the pratishakya or not. For example, even leaving aside the svaras, praukShan (प्रौक्षन्) should not be written as praukhShann (प्रौख्षन्न्), even though that is the modern practice in many modern publications.



For side-by-side examples of what I am talking about, see pdf page # 18 (printed page xvi) on <http://www.aupasana.com/file-cabinet/yajusha_2012_07_26.pdf>



sasneham,



 ajit
