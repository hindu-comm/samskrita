Yes the mark is slightly different (a bit shorter). The problem lies with the font in this particular case. If a font provides both the combining versions of accents (Unicode 0951 and 0952, which is the character that ITranslator renders) and the floating versions of accents (Unicode E007 and E009), I expect both versions to be exactly alike except for the floating part. This is not the case with Sanskrit 2003 - the former are right-aligned and adjunct, the latter ones are centered and separate. It is great that the font designer took extra care and provided floating versions, might have made them same or added a few more accent marks which are the same as the non-floating version.  
  
Also, the ITranslator manual has a section with this - see section 3.2 of Appendix II, "Manual Patches for Svaras on pada-final Nasals" (page 133). The manual is under <http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf>

Yes, they are on page 25 of the manual, section 3 "Special Latin Codes and Private Use Area Codes of Sanskrit 2003.

From a Paninian perspective, the उदात्त, अनुदात्त and स्वरित classification applies only to vowels, which have 12 or 18 types depending on ह्रस्व/दीर्घ/प्लुत (two or three of these), उदात्त/अनुदात्त/स्वरित (three of these) and अनुनासिक/अननुनासिक (two of these). Among consonants, only य्, व्, ल् are of two types - depending on अनुनासिक/अननुनासिक. All other consonants are only of one type without any difference in tone, length or nasalization. This is my understanding from Siddhantakaumudi.  
  
Given this, I would like to listen to an audio recording if possible to see how a "svarita on a halant" is different from an "udatta on a halant" or "anudatta on a halant". I suspect a vowel (maybe a very faint vowel) would have to be added after the halant to make them distinct, as Ajit Krishnan Mahodaya has pointed out.
