namaste,

Yes.

  

  

\> Surely a vowel must be Svarita and not the consonant

\> Is it a convention adopted in manuscripts or printing?  

  

  

Both in practice, and in modern publications, the accents are sometimes placed on the consonants. Often, the chanter adds a vowel to help render the accent on the consonant.

  

From the perspective of the tradition, this is the way the texts are handed down, and taught ... even by ghanapatis. From an academic perspective, these are clearly corruptions.

  

sasneham,

  

 ajit
