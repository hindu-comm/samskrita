Dear Nityanand,

  

First of all, many thanks for your help in resolving this issue.

  

I didn't mean to annoy you with the screenshot. I felt that the root of the problem lay in my input to XeLATeX, and therefore showed the exact differences between word (where it pastes correctly), vs. TeXworks, where it pasted incorrectly. I really couldn't be complaining about XeLATeX, when I never gave it a correct input.

  

Thanks for the workaround, nevertheless. But, can you note the minor difference in the word rendering (screenshot), vs. your PDF output? Is there something more to this?

  

I will explore the private space of Sanskrit 2003 to see if there are other constructs like this that can solve similar issues that I have.

  

BTW,I have heard purusha suktam (the verse I sent was from navagraha suktam though) chanted by several people, ghanapathis (my own guru is a ghanapathi) and all, and I have heard them using the svarita on the halant; is that a possible exception only for nakara with the halant (similarly on makara)? Of course, I have mostly only listened to Krishna Yajurvedis. I will see if I can get more information that might serve to clarify.

  

Best,

Karthik
