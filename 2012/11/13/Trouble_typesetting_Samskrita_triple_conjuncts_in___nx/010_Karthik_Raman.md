Dear Nityanand,

  

Thanks for the many useful resources!! Will look into them.

  

As for the halant svarita, listen to this:<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9EUIzIONFw> (at around 1:50, there is a vakyam ending with a halant+svarita): "taM yaGYaM barhiShi praukSh**an**"

  

Best regards,

Karthik
