Thanks for confirming.

What do the critical editions say on this? Has anybody raised this point in the critical editions that the Svara mark should be on य and not on न्?  
  
I see this as a serious corruption - adding a vowel which is not present would violate the metre and meaning of the Richa. The manuscripts must follow the oral tradition, and if what you say is true, we have a case of oral tradition following the manuscripts which is unacceptable.  
  
When the Kaholas commit mistakes, the Ashtavakras must correct them. Can the Vedic shcolars and Ghanapathis come together to address these and come with some standards for the future generations? Or are they convinced that what is handed over is correct and beyond questioning?
