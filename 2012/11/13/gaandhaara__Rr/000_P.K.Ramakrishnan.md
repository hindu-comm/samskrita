I thank Dr. Bhat for his complements and providing information about the word Gaandhaara.

  

From that I derive the following.

  

गान्धार:

  

गन्ध एव गान्ध: / स्वार्थे अण् /

तं ऋच्छति इति गांधार: / कर्मण्यण् / उत्पत्तिकारत्वमेव गच्छति इति /

  

From this it can be inferred that this place is where gandha is produced. 

Gandha means smell. What are the items which produce gandha.

One is sulphur. But Gaandhara does not produce sulphar.

The main product of Gaandhaara producing smell is hingu or

hing. To reduce its smell it is diluted with wheat flour or rice flour.

Hingu or hing is mainly produced in Gaandhaara.

  

Therefore I deduce the connection between hingu and gaandhaara.

  

I welcome comments from learned members.
