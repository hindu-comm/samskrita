Dear Shri Subrahmanian,



I am no scholar, but an ordinary student of Sanskrit.



I came across the following during my search for panch-pranava, and I share it with you, for whatever it is worth.



"SrividyA has got its own praNavas, these being hrIm,zrIm, aim,
klIm and sauH."



may be these are the panch pranavas?

Also, the reading I have is अम्बा शाम्भवि in place of **अम्बा शाश्वरि** given by you.

I do not know what does **शाश्वरि** mean. Shall be happy if you enlighten.

Regards

Satyajit
