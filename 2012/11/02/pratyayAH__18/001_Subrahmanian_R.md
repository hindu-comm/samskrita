Mahodaya,



कस्त्वं शूली -- was an interesting piece, with very lucid presentation also. I have *seen* it earlier but not understood it fully.

This brings to my mind two other similar verses, only traces of which I recollect.

The first one is a conversation between Lakshmi and Parvati. Just as in the example quoted, Parvati was able to give different interpretations for each word uttered by Siva, in this Parvati gives different interpretations to the words of Lakshmi. It started with

भिक्षार्थी सक्वयाद: . When Lakshmi taunts Parvati calling Siva a 'beggar' \[who is renowned to be roaming with a skull in hand and least caring for his attire\], Parvati asks: 'Which beggar do you mean? Is it the one who begged something from Bali?' Then Lakshmi says, 'the Dancer'. Siva tANDava, rudra tANDava, naTarAja, ajapA naTanam are all famous. But Parvati asks: "do you mean the one who danced over the serpent Kalinga?' and so it goes.

The other one which I read in Bhavan's Journal somewhere arouind 1990 consisted of about 7-8 verses. Whatever Parvati says, Siva interprets it differently. The first verse started with: विजये कुशालस् - they were playing dice and Parvati says victory is mine. But Siva takes Vijaya as the name of the maid present: विजये कुशलोस्मि. Then there was some reference to अंक - She meant the die/ dice. He meant the thigh and says 'we are wedded for thousand celestial years --- '

I will be happy if someone can reproduce these two.

Reverentially

R Subrahmanian
