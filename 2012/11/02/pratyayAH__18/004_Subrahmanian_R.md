Thank you very much for the quotation and for the enormous attachment. I am extremely happy to once again read the Parvati Parameswara samvadam. As to the attachment, it is diificult for me to grasp quickly, but interesting and I will make efforts to enjoy it. Some of the verses look like the language used by Jains in their prayvers.



With reverence,

R Subrahmanian
