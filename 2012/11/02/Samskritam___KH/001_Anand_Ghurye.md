Dear Sir ,  
  
I have always maintained that people will learn a language only when they perceive it to be beneficial . A tenth standard level many above average students take up Sanskrit as subject as they feel that it is a scoring subject and will fetch them good marks .  
  
In the school Sanskrit is taught in a very boring way , and none of its strengths are brought to the notice of the students .  
  
So even the students who have learnt rudimentary Sanskrit in tenth standard , in later life do not study the same or do not keep in touch with Sanskrit . If they were to realise the multiple advantages gained by keeping in touch with Sanskrit , the picture will be different .  
  
For example , there are coaching classes in Mumbai to teach voice culture which charge hefty fees . Those students who are taught proper recitation of various shlokas do not need voice culture lessons !  
  
Regards ,
