Why should you repeatedly place the same request even without bothering to read the replies to the earlier posts? I am sorry to bring to your notice:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/i84DWgMh_y8/discussion>  

  

Even you have not given any hints or any words of the verse, but flatly placed your request. Please be specific in your request. There are many texts written by Parashara and many will contain the word Parasara or information belonging to him as the earlier replies have made clear

  

With regards
