I don't understand why members do not care to have a look at the earlier messages in a thread. In this case, it has already been noticed long ago by another member:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/l9pAWao_dz8/rGPNl3lJrnQJ>  

  

Simply repeating the same reply doesn't add anything of value for the quotation or the source. It is the same Ramayana of Valmiki, and the missing line is

  

अपि स्वर्णमयी लङ्का न मे लक्ष्मण रोचते।

  

which had been the source of dispute about the source. Only the second half is found in Hindi Pracar sabha Edition of Krishnamachar which is also noted in the earlier post.
