I can now see why Ajit Gangeshwari was misled into thinking that I was making 'sweeping remarks without knowing facts or verifying the source of a given phrase'.

  

In my posting above I had giventhe illustration ofसत्यमेव जयते as a national motto, just asजननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी is the national motto of Nepal. The latter, as is now clear, is without a 'lineage' This attribute of non-lineage was not meant to be attributable toसत्यमेव जयते, whose lineage, as explained above, has already been sourced by me. This fact was notsufficientlyclear from the wording that I have employed above.
