Ajit,

  

Why do you say that I have made 'sweeping remarks without knowing facts or verifying the source of a given phrase'?  I have said several months ago exactly what you are saying now, viz. that the source ofthe motto "सत्यमेव जयते" is the well-known mantra 3.1.6 of Mundaka Upanishad. 

  

We are on the same page here and saying exactly the same thing. Please read my posting of January 15, 2012 under the thread<https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!searchin/samskrita/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80$20%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A/samskrita/yD2v6tBSob4/CTKsNuWhWKsJ>which I have already quoted earlier
