Hi Kaushik,

  

Janani.. saying has relevance even today and we cant disprove its reference literally from available Vaalmiki version of the ancient epic dated back to pre-scripting/printed era. There is possibility of inclusions - however the best judgement is based on what life events /ideals these inclusions endorse.

  

Vedas/mahavakyas explain us spiritual principles where as Puranas are based on how great personalities of ancient times lead life on earth in order to implement those principles. Janani Janmabhumicha.. is such a ideal and it compares mother and motherland as higher than worldly benefits/heavens.Just life ideal of monogamy,and the idea/ideal of mother and motherland has great significance to influence civilization, these are some of reasons soit optly fits into Purana/Epics rather than Vedas - to examine if this really uttered by SriRama or is it a later edition we need to see surrounding events as allthough Ramayana is vast with 24,000 verses - a poem is never not adequate to depict entire life story and every sentence uttered by SriRama like noble and great personality. Under same story line provided by Vaalmiki, we see SriRama won Lanka in battle and returns to Ayodhya which endorses his love for mother and mother land. Another interesting points here is while he is returning he wants Hanuma to study body language of Bharata ( is not to confirm himself if his brother is really happy about his return ?) and his decision to nominate non other than brother of Ravana as successor/ruler of Lanka- but not extending his stay at Lanka.
