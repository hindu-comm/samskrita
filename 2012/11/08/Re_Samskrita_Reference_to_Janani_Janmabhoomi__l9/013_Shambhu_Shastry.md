This is tangential to this forum, but Indians anywhere ought to know:

  

India's national emblem (with "satyameva jayate" in Devanaagari script) was created in 1949-1950. It is a two-dimensional image of a portion of the Ashoka-era stone-carved lion capital of Saranath (image as seen from a side of the Saranath lion capital with its inverted lotus or bell base deleted).

  

This lion capital was knocked off its pillar at Saranath by Turk Islamic invaders and was broken down (pieces were glued and it is now preserved in Saranath Museum). "satyameva jayate" of Mundaka Upanishad (in Samskritam, not Pali) seen on the national emblem was and is not at all part of the lion capital of Saranath. Only Ashoka's Prakrit (again, not Pali) edict in Brahmi script appears on the Saranath pillar, and not on the lion capital. In general, Ashoka's edicts were in the language of the region: In Gaandhaara, it was in Greek and Armenian, though script was Brahmi throughout.

  

Some more history side notes: A 13th century replica of Ashoka's Saranath pillar with the lion capital and a Dharma Chakra on its top exists erect in Thailand:<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Ashoka>. India's Supreme Court emblem is similar to the national emblem with a Dharma Chakra image on the top.
