Dear Friends ,  
  
  

Whether a national emblem has to have a sacred connection is debatable . There is a reference to Satyamev Jayate in one of the above emails . I believe that Satyamev Jayate is Pali and not Sanskrit . The time when the emblem was created , the Rajbhasha was Pali . In this case can we say that it is a quote connected to Upanishad ?  
  

Regards ,
