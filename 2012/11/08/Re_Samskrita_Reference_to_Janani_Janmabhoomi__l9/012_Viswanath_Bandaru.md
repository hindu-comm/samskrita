Dear Shri Anand,

  

I don't know if being the 'Raj Bhasha' has any thing to do with what we pick text from. For example, Hindi is the rajbhasha for us, and yet so many Govt Organizations have Sanskrit 'motto's.

  

I am curious to know if you have any other inclination, why it may be Pali ?

  

Btw, isn't it Satyameva Jayate ? Note the 'a' towards the end of the first word. Amir's show spoiled the spelling :)

  

Thanks,

Vissu
