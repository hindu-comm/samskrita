Namste,  
  
I think Arvind Kolhatkar makes sweeping remarks without knowing facts or verifying the source of a given phrase  
The origin of the motto"सत्यमेव जयते" is a well-known mantra 3.1.6 of Mundaka Upanishad  
सत्यमेव जयति नानृतं  
सत्येन पन्था विततो देवयानः \|  
येनाक्रमन्त्यृषयो ह्याप्तकामा  
यत्र तत् सत्यस्य परमं निधानम् \|\|६\|\|  
  
The Phrase Janani Janmabhoomi as pointed out has benn discussed
