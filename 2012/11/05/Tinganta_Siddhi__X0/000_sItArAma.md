has anyone in the group tried these DVDs, I bought it from Sanskrit Bharati India and now I am abroad and CD10, 13 and 14 are not playing well.

If anyone in the group has a working DVD then I would appreciate if she/he can share. I am asking here because I don't want to deal with Sanskrit Bhrarti India from Abroad.

I would appreciate your help
