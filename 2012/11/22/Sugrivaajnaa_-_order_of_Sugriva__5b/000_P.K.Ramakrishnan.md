Sugriva Aajnaa (Sugriva’s Order)



Sugriva is a great Monkey King in Ramayana.



After promising all help to Rama in finding Sita,

he forgot the promise. He was with his wife Ruma

got back from Bali after Bali was killed by Rama.



Rama sent Lakshmana to Sugriva to remind him about

the terms agreed to between Rama and Sugriva.



Sugriva says that he had already arranged to despatch

the monkey groups. He called them one by one of the

four groups.



To the Eastern Group he says where to search for Sita.

He concludes by saying –



ऊर्ध्वं मासान् न वस्तव्यं वसन् वध्यो भवेन् मम /



Should not stay away for more than a month. If you stay

more you will be executed.



Valmikiramayana Kishkindhakanda Sarga 40 Sloka 70



Sugriva repeats the same order to the Western Group also.



The Southern Group headed by Angada not having found

Sita yet and having exceeded the time of one month decided

not to return and get executed. They decided to die without

taking any food.
