Thank you Bhat Ji

I have Narayaniyam at hand so I looked up the verses with **sa tvam**

The first line is missing but the verse you quoted is canto 30 verse 10, but see also canto 16, verse 10, Canto 35 verse 10, Canto 37, verse 10, Canto 67, verse 10, Canto 88. verse 12

Here it means something like: You, who have done all these great and wondrous things……………….(sa tvam) **that same you**……….please protect (or help or cure. etc) me.

In canto 83 verse 10 there is **tam tvAm** (accusative)
