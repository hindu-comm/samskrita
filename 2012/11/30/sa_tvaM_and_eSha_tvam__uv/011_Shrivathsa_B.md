hariH OM,  
bhat sir,  
  
 I am and will ever be grateful for your beautiful explanations. I have taken note of them (i am reading them again for better understanding). However, there is something that comes immediately to mind. The reason I associated viShNu with killing of namuci is because of what i remember from dUtavAkyaM:  
पादः पायादुपेन्द्रस्य सर्वलोकोत्सवः स वः ।  
व्याविद्धो नमुचिर्येन तनुताम्रनखेन खे ॥  
  
 I am not aware of the actual story apart from what has been said by bhAsa above and what I gathered from the internet (in which it is clear that namuci was killed by indra).  
  
 I wish to know why bhAsa would say so. In the Indra case, namuci was killed by the froth of the ocean, in the Vishnu case, he was killed by the toe-nails of viShNu.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
