Shrivathsa Mahodaya

The rule is given in Whitney's grammar page 60, paragraph 176 a:

"The nominative masculine pronouns **sas** and **eSas** and (vedic) **syas** lose their **s** before any consonant". (leaving hiatus - my comment).



So in your example, it would be **sa tvam**

But although this is grammatically correct I think it would so not make so much sense sense since the meaning would be something like **that you** rather than **he and you** which would need a **ca** after tvam.
My feeling is that you can't make compounds using only personal pronouns - but I can't find the rule for this.



Then the usual sandhi applies (nominative masc pronoun sing) sa + a it becomes so with elision of initial vowel. There are some Vedic irregularities.

Other learned members can give you a better explanation using Indian system.
