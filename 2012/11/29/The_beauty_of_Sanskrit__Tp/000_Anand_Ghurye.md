Dear Friends ,  
  
Recently I was preparing for a presentation on Electional Astrology . A technical and complicated subject . The audience was to be heterogeneous consisting of seasoned astrologers as well as astrology enthusiasts . I wanted to give some simple formula for electional astrology for the laymen and the novices . Suddenly I remembered the following shloka which is recited at marriage time  
  
Tadeva lagnam sudinam tadeva, taara-balam chandra-balam tadeva  
Vidyaa balam daiva-balam tadeva, Lakshmi-pateh tenghri yugam smaraami  
  
and I realised that it was giving all the basics of electional astrology in a nutshell . Check the ascendant , check dinashuddhi , check tara bala , check chandrabala , check vidya bala and daiva bala , recite the name of god and proceed . One shloka to summarise a two hour lecture ! That is the beauty of Sanskrit !  
  
Of course , the best Aashirvad that comes after this - Shubha Mangala , Savadhaan ! Let all be auspicious , take care !  
  
Regards ,
