I think this has been discussed in some earlier archives long ago. I too could not locate it to Ramayana available online or offline. Our friend SL Abhyankar has studied this verse in detail as Valmiki's shloka in his new approach:

  

<http://slabhyankar.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/learning-sanskrit-by-fresh-approach-lesson-no-105/>  

  

It had been discussed by our friend V Subrahmanyam in advaita list according to Advaita philosophy:

  

<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.advaita/15638>

  

So this is widely discussed in different pages, some ascribing the same verse both to Hanuman and Ravana also on different contexts.

  

Here is the ascription to a story when it was quoted:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/realizationofself/sWZPQ0ED1Eg/discussion>

  

Here is another blogspot, which ascribes the conversation between Shiva and Vishnu:

  

<http://samskrtam.wordpress.com/category/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D/>  

  

also.

  

But it seems not to belong to any version of Valmiki Ramayana.  
At least it is found in this web called हनुमत्स्तुति -\\  

देहदृष्टया तु दासोऽहं जीवदृष्टया*त्वदंशकः*।

वस्तुतस्तु त्वमेवाहमिति मे निश्चिता मतिः ॥४०॥  

  

as part of Hanumatstuti, ascribed to Sri Shankaracharya:

  

[(श्रीहनुमत्‌सूक्तिः)](http://www.khapre.org/portal/url/sa/sahitya/sukti/04/z80314051822(%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E2%80%8C%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%83).aspx)

  

by Khapre. But could not land on search in any of web pages presenting Valmiki Ramayana, though there are several.

  

With regards
