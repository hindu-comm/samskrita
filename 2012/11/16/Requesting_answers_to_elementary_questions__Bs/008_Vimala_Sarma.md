Bhat Mahodaya

My explanation was:



As I understand it the sentence is as follows

O God! Make for me no obstacles when (I am doing) all (my) deeds always.



nirvighnam here is not a verb so it is not governing anything. It is the accusative or object in the part of the sentence which says "Make (imperative) for me no obstacles" (object).

kAryeshu is plural locative of kArya because the sentence is using the absolutive locative - "when doing deeds" or "in doing deeds"



Of course it could also be simple locative plural if the sentence is translated as ……………"in works".
