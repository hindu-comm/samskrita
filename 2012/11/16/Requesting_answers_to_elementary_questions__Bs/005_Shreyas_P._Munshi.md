Respected Bhat Sir,  
Thanks Re "nirvighnam kuru me deva sarvakAryeshu sarvadA"

You have nicely cleared my query by your translating 'nirvighnam kuru' as "**do absence** of obstacles". Thank you Sir, much obliged. Going by dictionary meaning of 'nirvighnam' , I had been translating as 'do obstaclefree' and that raised a natural question 'do obstaclesfree WHAT?' and for that question I could not get a sensible answer. No answer was forthhcoming to the question 'kuru' what? . Now you have given me the answer. Thanks once again. .

Further clarity came to me from respected Vimala-ji's pointing out that 'kAryeshu' in the shloka is in the absolute locative..."in (my) doing works"...this makesit very clear to me.( I realize that the term 'works' can be sustituted by actions/efforts/deliberations/yagnas/duties etc). My grateful thanks to her as well.
