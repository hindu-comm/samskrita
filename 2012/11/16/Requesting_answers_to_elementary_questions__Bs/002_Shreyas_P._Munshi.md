Thank you Bhat Sir for the clear direction for reading out or speaking out of the digits of telephone number (my Q2). Would you now Kindly favour me also with answers to my Q1 and Q3? In Q3, use of 'nirvighnam' as an adverb is well understood (so also its meaning) but what I seek clarification is about the use of the locative case 'kAryeshu'. Would 'nirvighnam' always attract the locative for the plural of nouns like 'kAryAH', YAtrAH, 'krIDAH', 'vruttayaH'(I dont know how to type the 'r' with a dot below), 'yagnAH', 'pUjAH' etc. Regards...Shreyas

Would anyone from the scholarly fraternity oblige me with answers to my following elementary questions?  
  
  
  
Q1. Should the reading out (speaking out) of the digits of a number be from left to  
  
right or R to L?  
  
For example '1947' should be read out as 'sapta chatur nava ek' or 'ek nava chatur sapta'?  
  
(If I remember correctly, two years ago when I attended SamskritabhArati sambhAshaNa shibir near Delhi, we were encouraged to say the year 1947 as 'saptachatvArinshatAdhikaNavaDasha shatam'. But my question is about reading out of the digits one by one as we would do one nine four seven in English for 1947).  
  
  
  
  
Q2. Must the Telephone numbers be read out always from R to L. e.g. 9801462357 should always be read out as nava ashtau shunya ek chatur ShaT dwi tri pancha sapta as we do in English?  
  
  
  
Q3. In the Ganapati invocation shloka "nirvighnam kuru me deva sarva kAryeShu sarvadA", does 'nirvighnam' always attract (govern) the locative (saptami)? Would it have been incorrect to say "nirvighnam kuru me deva sarva kAryANi sarvadA" (kAryANi in dwitiya plural)?
