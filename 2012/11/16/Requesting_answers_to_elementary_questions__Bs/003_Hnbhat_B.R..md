Thank you Bhat Sir for the clear direction for reading out or speaking out of the digits of telephone number (my Q2).

  

Would you now Kindly favour me also with answers to my Q1 and Q3? In Q3, use of 'nirvighnam' as an adverb is well understood (so also its meaning) but what I seek clarification is about the use of the locative case 'kAryeshu'. Would 'nirvighnam' always attract the locative for the plural of nouns like 'kAryAH', YAtrAH, 'krIDAH', 'vruttayaH'(I dont know how to type the 'r' with a dot below), 'yagnAH', 'pUjAH' etc. Regards...Shreyas

It can be correct grammatically if Ganesha himself does the works for you as the object of "kuru" and you will not get the result of the prayer.

And for this grammatical correct form, you have to change the popular reading of the prayer.

  

It will be related as मे कार्याणि निर्विघ्नं कुरु - Do my works (?) uninterrupted (continuously)! Is it the meaning intended? This also would end up in undesired result like the Q.1 & 2.

  

On the other hand, विघ्नानामभावः - निर्विघ्नम् - अर्थाभावेऽव्ययीभावः। The meaning is the same, absence of obstacles. It is the object of कुरु and the meaning will be do absence of obstacles, Please do favor so that there is no obstacles, सर्वकार्येषु सर्वदा - in all my activities always. This is the really intended meaning of the prayer. If you have any questions, why there is no द्वितीया for being the object of कुरु. It is already there, only it is replaced with अम् in all the case endings, except पञ्चमी and optionally in तृतीया.

  

I hope your problem is solved.
