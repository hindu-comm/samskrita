In any of my acts (which can be elaborated as religious/social/enterpreneur or any kind of endeavors) need not be specific. That much is conveyed by कार्य - whatever being done by me., guard me in all my endeavors against any possible impediment - is the purport of the prayer.

  

I purposefully interpreted it as "work" do all my works, without impediments (interruptions) always.

  

मे सर्वकार्याणि स्र्वदा निर्विघ्नं कुरु - will be the request plainly. asking Ganesha to do your work (for you) without interruption at any time.!

  

in case we read as you have suggested. While the popular reading never gives place for such interpretation.

  

The locative is not absolutive, but purely locative. I didn't notice Vimalaji's reply.

Because, there is absence of pot in this place means there is no pot in this place. It is just the same thing.

nirvighnam means absence of obstacles. So it can occur in any act (figuratively said to be concrete as the location for the absence). There is no need to resort to absolute locative.

  

With regards
