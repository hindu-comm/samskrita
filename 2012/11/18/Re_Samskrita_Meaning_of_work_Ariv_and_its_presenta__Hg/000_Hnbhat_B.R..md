Dear friend,

  

Please type in devnagari fonts, using correct spelling. I could not figure out anything out of your roman spelling of the word. Please mention also where you got the word.

  

Otherwise, it would be hard to guess. If it is from some baby name lists available online, it is hopeless to find a correct Sanskrit word.
