11th Anuvaka of शीक्षाध्याय

  

अलूक्षा(:) = अरूक्षाः, अक्रूरमतयः - ,  धर्मकामा(:) = अदृष्टार्थिनोऽकामहताः - (इत्येतत् )- स्यु:

  

The above is the शङ्कराचार्यव्याख्या। The wordings are clear enough to have any translation.

  

In short, who are not free from pride and prejudices and only intent upon following the धर्म - which is defined as अदृष्ट technically the result of following the धर्म which is prescribed by the विधि in the Veda-s and this is done without any lust or greet of mundane pleasure - अकामहताः, means only धर्मकामाः and.,

  

The explanation is my own as I can understand from the lines of भाष्य.
