Dear Group,

  

At his coronation at Raigad Fort, Shivaji took the title ofछत्रपति to signify his sovereignty andindependencefrom the Emperor at Delhi. It is known that he had the the rite of coronation researched by the learned Brahmins of VaaraaNasI, as it had fallen into disuse over the previous centuries.

  

In the vast body of Sanskrit literature is there any evidence of the use of this title ofछत्रपति- and in this sense - prior to the coronation ?
Or was itspeciallycoined for the occasion? (Monier-Williams, citing सिंहासनद्वात्रिंशिका, explains this word as 'the officer watching over the royal parasol'.)

  

One of the things he did after his coronation was the introduction of Sanskrit-derived terms, such asअमात्य, मन्त्री to replace their Arabic-Persian equivalents. With this in view, he had also got composed a Manual of Administration, calledराज्यव्यवहारकोष.
