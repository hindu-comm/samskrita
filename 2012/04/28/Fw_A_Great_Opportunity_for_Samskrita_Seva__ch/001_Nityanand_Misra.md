Dear Sri Ramakrishnan  
  
If you know the people at the institute, can you please request them to share their account details (account number, beneficiary name, branch details, IFSC code et cetera) with this and other mailing lists.  
  
I will forward it to some friends of mine who will be willing to donate, but quite a few of them are outside India and would prefer to transfer funds online.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
