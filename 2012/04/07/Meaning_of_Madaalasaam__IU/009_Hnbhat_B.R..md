For your reply to my big WHY, Kedar has got the answer which has been replied in earlier thread about naming:

  

<http://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/browse_thread/thread/675b0deea8af8973/33f3edf82315c678?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=aarush#33f3edf82315c678>

  

And for the meaning, you can find a lot of meaning in the dictionary references given by Mme. Vimala and now the choice is yours and your friend.

  

By naming a magazine, it will be lazy or faltering in its progress, as the name suggests though gay and rejoicing itself.![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/382f728409edbd3/332.gif?part=0.1)![](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/382f728409edbd3/332.gif?part=0.1)
