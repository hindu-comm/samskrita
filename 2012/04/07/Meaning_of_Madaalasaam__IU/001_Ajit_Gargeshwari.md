This is a popular verse (at least in certain parts of the country) and is best handled with sensitivity in translation. I am not using Apte's translation.  
On a Scholars recommendation  
  
(ahaM) madAlasAM (devIM) manasA smarAmi.  
  
I contemplate that Devi who is passionate, yet in a calm, relaxed state.
