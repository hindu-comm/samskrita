I don't understand why should you always look up into a root for any word you find. First get exposed to a considerable span of classical Sanskrit Literature with any commentary by which you should know many things that dictionaries or etymologies could provide.

  

Anyhow here is an attempt to explain the word in the context:

  

माद्यतीति मदः, "मदी हर्षे" दिवादिः, परस्मैपदी, सेट् - "मदोऽनुपसर्गे"(३.३.६७) इत्यप् प्रत्ययः। मदः। - 

  

"मदो मुन्मोहसंभेदः" इति अभिधानचिन्तामणिः (देवकाण्डे २.३१२):

  

मुन्मोहयोः - आनन्द-संमोहयोः, संभेदः - संगमः = मदः;

मत्तताइत्यर्थः। intoxication.

उपसर्गे तु, उन्मादः इति पर्यायः तस्मादेव निष्पन्नः।

  

न लसति = व्याप्रियते इति अलसः, लस् - श्लेषण-क्रीडनयोः,भ्वादिः, परस्मैपदी, सेट् - अच्प्रत्यये नञ् समासः।मन्थरः इत्यर्थ:

"अथालस्यः शीतकोऽलसः" इति च हेमचन्द्रः, शीतक इत्यर्थः। inactive, idle looking.

  

मदेन अलसा - मदालसा इति समासः।

  

Literally inactive, idle looking due to intoxication.

  

Here you are given the derivation from the root for both the words and the समास if you are wanting for them to make out a clearer meaning.

  

I leave it to you to make out the meaning in the context as you asked only for the word in the verse and I assume that you are well versed with the verse otherwise.

  

Hope now you can make out the meaning for the whole verse. Wish you all the best.
