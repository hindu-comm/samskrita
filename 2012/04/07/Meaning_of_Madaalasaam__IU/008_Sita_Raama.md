Dr. Bhat,

I really appreciate your feedback even though it sounded like you were frustrated about my inquiries about etymology.

Anyways just to answer your big "Why", a friend of mine is contemplating naming their school magazine "Madalasa"

I did not have any answers for him so decided to ask here.

once again thanks for your help
