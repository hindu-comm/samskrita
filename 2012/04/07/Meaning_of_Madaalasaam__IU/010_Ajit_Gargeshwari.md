Dear Raama ji,  
  
There are innumerable shlokas and poems I can say millions have been composed by various bhaktas as a mark of devotion with great humility towards different Gods and Godesses. If one looks up a dictionary and try to translate these sholkas into a foreign language such as English, irrespective of the competence of the scholar the sense and original meaning is lost.  
  
Bhava, emotion and sentiment of the composer can never be translated. I don't see the point how etymology and grammatical derivations of such words in such sholkas can help it will purely an academic or theoretical exercise.  
  
There are several verses which can have erotic or distasteful meaning for a superficial reader if the verses are removed from the context in which they are composed. I feel the best solution would be to develop a taste for such reading ideally the reader also one needs to be a Bhakta to understand Bhakti or devotion. The concept of Bhakti and such sholkas are personal to the composer and symbolizes a divine relationship a bhakta enjoys with his or her God.  
  
One can ignore this mail as this is purely my view point.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
