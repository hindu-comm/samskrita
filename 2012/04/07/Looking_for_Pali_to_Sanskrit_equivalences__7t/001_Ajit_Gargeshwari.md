**sampajañña: **'clarity of consciousness', clear comprehension. This term is frequently met with in combination with mindfulness *(**sati**).* In D. 22, M. 10 it is said: "Clearly conscious is he in going and coming, clearly conscious in looking forward and backward, clearly conscious in bending and stretching his body; clearly conscious in eating, drinking, chewing and tasting, clearly conscious in discharging excrement and urine; clearly conscious in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep and awakening; clearly conscious in speaking and keeping silent." - For a definition of the term ***sati-sampajañña****,* s.
