also as given by Mr. Ajit amd Mme. Vimalaji. I have no comments on the correctness of the equivalents as both have to be consulted with reference to the context in which they appear, but seemingly both are derived from संप्रज्ञा (samprajñā) in that ज्ञा or ज्ञाण could be transformed into जाण in Pali or Prakrit. Or ज्ञात also could be as adjective.
