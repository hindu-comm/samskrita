Esteemed scholars,

  

I am looking for some Pali to Sanskrit equivalences, or translations, and hope that some of the learned scholars here may help guide me.



First, is there a Pali-Sanskrit lexicon available, that anyone here knows of?



Alternatively, might there be clear rules that one can apply to Pali words so as to find their Sanskrit equivalences? Would anyone know of a reference that gives these rules?



More specifically, I wish to know the Sanskrit equivalents for these two Pali words: sampajāna , sampajañña .



I believe the second of these is a noun form, and the first one an adjective. Both Pali words have to do with what is called ‘clear comprehension’ in various sources.



I am suspecting that both might be written as saṃprajñāna, संप्रज्ञान , in Sanskrit. Does that seem correct?



Thank you, in advance, for any ideas.
