Dear Brian

Steven Collins "A Pali Grammar for Students" Silkworm Books, 2006, ISBN 978-974-9511-13-8, assumes a prior knowledge of Sanskrit and gives the rules for Pali derivation from Sanskrit, and also the grammar which collapses some of the 10 Sanskrit classes. So going from Sanskrit to Pali is not so much of a problem. However going from Pali to Sanskrit, because of rules for dissimilar juxtaposed consonants, etc, you can end up with a number of Sanskrit equivalents so you would need to choose the one that makes sense or try looking at a Sanskrit text for that same work. There are Sanskrit words which do not appear in classical Sanskrit texts but only in Buddhist texts and other words which are Sanskrit words but used in a special technical sense in Buddhism. For these you need the Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit dictionary by Edgerton.

Re: sampajāna , sampajañña - the first means knowing adj, the second means intelligence noun, and the root is jñā. What you have written is fine but I cannot comment on the technical or philosophical meaning.
