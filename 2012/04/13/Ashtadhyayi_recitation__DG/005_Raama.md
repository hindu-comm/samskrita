Susarlaji,  
If sanskrit bharati thinks there is a pronunciation issue did they  
ever tell you where to improve?  
I am a beginner and I want to learn Astadhyaayi in serial order and  
your audio is a great help to memorize the sutras.  
If you think I can be some help in this recording project let me know.  
I managed to add 3 repetitions of each stura, its easy to memorize  
that way.  
Sorry did with without asking the creators permission, but thats only  
for personal use and I did not distribute because of copyright  
issues.  
Thanks for your help  
Raama
