Actually, the issue was very minor. In the pronunciation, they're supposed not to elongate the pronunciation of hrasva varNas at the end of the sutra like they did sometimes in the audio.

etc. :-)  
  
I think you can go ahead and use the sutra audio with modifications like those you did.  
SB is less worried about copyrights than with their reputation getting tarnished because of less than perfect pronunciation.
