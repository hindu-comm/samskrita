I don't think it is a such serious mistake as supposed by people, as it is style to pronounce "visarga", with the influence of the vowel preceding it, which seems to be strange for those who are not acquainted with it.

  

The justification lies in the Paniniya Shiksha itself,

  

अयोगवाहाः विज्ञेया आश्रयस्थानभगिनः।

  

which is explained in the same way.

  

pronounced like गुणह, हरिहि, शंभुहु etc. in an Editorial Note. Right now

  

If they have pronounced आदेङ् गूणः, or ईको गूणव्द्धी etc. it would be a serious error changing totally the meaning of the word. Or for ears unfamiliar to the Karnataka pronunciation, some sounds may be received differently, if such is the error in such cases. Anyhow I have not heard the recitations as I am not in need of it. I can rely on the commentaries for their meaning with the published books.

  

With regards
