It's funny because what Ajit pointed to is the same recording that Vasuvaj and I did on behalf of SB. Venetia refers to the same thing. Later SB wanted it removed from [surasa.net](http://surasa.net) until the pronunciation is refined a bit more, which never happened for 2 years now. Talk about perfection vs. Practical utility :-)  
- Sai.
