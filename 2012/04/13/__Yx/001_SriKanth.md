Thank you very much. I downloaded the book and glanced first few  
pages. I have never seen the novel way to indicate the tenses and  
moods. This is easier to learn I guess.  
  
Table 2 -- The ten tenses and moods  
(1) acyuta - present tense: 'he does'  
(2) vidhi - rule or possibility: 'he should do'  
(3) vidh AtA - order or blessing: 'he must do'  
(4) bhUte svara - past tense (not same day): 'he did'  
(5) bhUtes a - past tense: 'he did'  
(6) adhok aja - past tense (not witnessed): 'he did'  
(7) k ArmAp la - blessing: 'let it be done'  
(8) b Alakalki - future tense (not same day): 'he will do'  
(9) kalki - future tense: 'he will do'  
(10) ajita - cause and effect: 'if ... then'
