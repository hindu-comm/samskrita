Please wait for some more time as they are filling in each Section by Section as they have notified in the beginning unless you yourself are creating the web sections as remarked by Mme. Vimala.

  

[TABLE]

  

  

.Hope you will get further information on other suffixes unless they have abandoned the job and not pursuing it due to any reason unknown.

  

An entry known to be similar in form but different reading:

  

[TABLE]

  

बालिका -girl;

  

butवालिका as in

sāyaṃ ca rājakanyāṅgulīyakamudritāṃ vāsatāmbūlapaṭṭāṃśukayugalabhūṣaṇāvayavagarbhāṃ ca vaṅgerikāṃ**kayācid vālikayā**grāhayitvā rāgamañjaryā iti nītvā kāntakasyāgāramagām //

-   a kind of ornament for the ears (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   a seal-ring (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   sand (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   the rustling of leaves (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

  

has got many other meanings, but not the girl and the above translations go wrong. as two girls etc. for वालिके.

  

The transliteration in some doesn't represent the Devanagari exactly:
