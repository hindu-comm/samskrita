Priya Bandhugana,

  

This website gives a nice overview ofSanskritgrammar structure, there are some typos etc but overall its good for beginners.

<http://samskrutam.com/samskrit/studies/grammar.aspx?section=studies>

  

Under Verbssuffixesand Noun suffixes they elaborated only a few, I was wondering ifknowledgeablepeople here care to comment on the suffixes which were not described on the page. or give some nice reference book where these can be found.

  

Thanks for your help

Raama
