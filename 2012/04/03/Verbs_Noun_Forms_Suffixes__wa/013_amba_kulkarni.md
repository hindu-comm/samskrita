The server at the university is rather slow. It will take some time to  
replace it with a faster one.  
Meanwhile, these tools are also available at the TDIL web site  
<http://tdil-dc.in/san/>  
  
In case of failure of our server, all are encouraged to use the tools  
at TDIL website.  
  
I would also appreciate the feedback in order to improve the tools  
further.  
  
With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni

\> Probably it should be able to give many forms of the verbs listed therein.  
\> Just I could try only one, but it took a lot of time.

\> Credits to go to amba Kulkarni for producing the tool. You can use this  
\> tool for reference and to get more forms.
