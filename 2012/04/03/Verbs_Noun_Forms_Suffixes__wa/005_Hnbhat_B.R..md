Here is a kRudanta Generator:

  

[sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/skt_gen/kqw/kqw_gen.html](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/skt_gen/kqw/kqw_gen.html)

  

Probably it should be able to give many forms of the verbs listed therein. Just I could try only one, but it took a lot of time.

  

Credits to go to amba Kulkarni for producing the tool. You can use this tool for reference and to get more forms.
