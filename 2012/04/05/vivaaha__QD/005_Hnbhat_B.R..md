This is what याज्ञवल्क्य thought as I have given in my earlier post:

  

ब्राह्मे विवाहे आहूय दीयते शक्त्यलंकृता।

  

and this is what आपस्तम्ब thought:

  

२.५.११.१७ । ब्राह्मे विवाहे बन्धु.शील.श्रुत.अरोग्याणि \[बुद्ध्वा प्रजा.सहत्वकर्मभ्यः \[प्रतिपादयेत्शक्तिविषयेण\[अलंकृत्य । ( क् १ःइन्सेर्त्स्लक्षणसम्पन्न, २ःप्रजां सहत्व )

२.५.११.१८ । आर्षे दुहितृमते मिथुनौ गावौ \[देयौ । This is what you mean.In आर्ष two cows are given to the father of the bride.

२.५.११.१९ । दैवे यज्ञ.तन्त्र ऋत्विजे \[प्रतिपादयेत् ।



which is again explained by याज्ञवल्क्य -

  

यज्ञस्थायार्त्विजे देयमादायार्षं तु गोयुगम्।

  

In fact, each दान is to be accompanied with दक्षिणा, which is to be given to the person who receives the दान. Here it कन्या that is given with दक्षिणा. which is called यौतक :

  

-   (esp.) property given at marriage (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   a present (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   a woman's dowry (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   presents made to a bride at her marriage by her father and friends
    (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988)) -   private property (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))

which is not shared with others.
