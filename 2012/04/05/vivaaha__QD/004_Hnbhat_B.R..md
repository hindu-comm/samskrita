I don't know what do you mean by "original intended meaning" whether intended by you or the definition of विवाह. I have given the meaning intended by the etymology as given in the ऐतेरेय ब्राह्मण and also the meaning intended by you is according to the राक्षस विवाह.

This is in view of the meaning of the word विवाह - to marry and not to carry away except in Rakshasavivaha.

  

वह् - to carry is the meaning by you. and by the राक्षसविवाह as by carry away the bride by defeating the relatives according to याज्ञवल्य्क्य.
