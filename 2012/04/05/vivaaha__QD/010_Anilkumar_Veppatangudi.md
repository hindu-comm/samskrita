I feel the words Vivaha and Udvaha refer to the journey to the husband's home rather than to anything else. Regarding the practice of the maternal uncle being the groom, the sastras are against it. Both Sagothra and Sapinda marriages were not recommended. Seven times removed from the mother's side and five times from the father's side should be the difference.Consanguineous marriages were not recommended.However, the practice is widely prevalent.

Regards,

Anil Kumar
