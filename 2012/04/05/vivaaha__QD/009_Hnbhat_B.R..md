Thanks for the explanation. It is customary in some communities that maternal uncle is entitled to marry the girl. In some, it the maternal cousin is entitled to marry her and vice versa.

  

This carrying in basket may be the application of the word udvAha - to carry (on head in a basket) when maternal uncle himself marries the girl. So it may be the literal meaning of vi=vAha also as suggested by P R Ramakrishnan. I wanted to confirm with somebody else knowing the different customs this meaning literally. As for the use of the word, in literary texts, the maxim is followed generally "योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी". all the terms are used with the meaningrestrictedto marry and marriage generally unless it is required for context otherwise. For example, भारमुद्वहति and कन्यामुद्वहति = where both coincide )in literal and literary meaning in रूढि (custom 0 religious and literary) as us evident from your explanation. The second both coincide in practice.
