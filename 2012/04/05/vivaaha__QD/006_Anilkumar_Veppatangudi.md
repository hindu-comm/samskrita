Vivaha coming from Vah Dhatu indicates the journey of the newly wedded wife to her husband's home. So does Udvaha another name for marriage. There are eight forms of marriage but in all of them there is ultimately the journey to the groom's home. The eight forms indicate different ways of acquiring a bride, including forcible carrying away as in Rakshasa or Paisacha forms but all forms expected marriage to be conducted as per Vivaha Samskara as specified in Grihya Sutras. Other names for marriage are Panigrahana(holding of the bride's hand by the groom), Parinaya based on agni parinayana, an essential part of the marriage ceremony. The journey to the husband's house was ritualistic with mantras prescribed for every step from getting the bullock cart ready, obstacles on the way, crossing water bodies etc.
