विशेषेण वहनम् - प्रापणम् - नयनम्,

  

to receive or accompany with seven steps together seems be important of part of the alliance as सखा सप्तपदी भव etc. are meant for the seven steps as discussed in some earlier thread.

  

The English literal translations would be sometimes funny without any cultural content in them; like वि + वह् - to carry away - विवाहः, उद् + वह् - to lift up, उद्वाहः - to carry on head/shoulder, उप+ यम् - to tie, to peg (any animal) - उपयमः (= approaching यम, it may mean women liberation leaders pegging the female counterpart) etc. Etymology should not be sought as the ultimate source of meaning in all the words, otherwise it would be a funny toy in the hands of inexperienced hands.

  

I was expecting Anil Kumar's reply earlier who had made a deep study of the विवाहसंस्कार-s. In modern days, I have seen the bride brought to the altar (विवाहमण्डप) being carried by her elder sister"s husband or some other relative practically such as maternal uncle. But I don't this as the part of any संस्कार as per the गृह्यसूत्र-s.
