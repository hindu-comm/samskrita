The procedure of bringing the bride in a basket by the maternal uncle is still prevalent among Telugus. One thing to note is that local customs and practices are to be given preference over what is in the Grihya Sutras.Apastamba says that one should consult senior ladies in the area about the procedures and proceed.There appears to no dogma that one has to follow the Sutras.
