#### Small units of time used in the Vedas

-   a **trasarenu** is the combination of 6 celestial *atoms*. -   a **truti** is the time needed to integrate 3 *trasarenus*, or
    1/1687.5th of a second. -   a **vedha** is 100 *trutis*. -   a **lava** is 3 *vedhas*. -   a **nimesha** is 3 *lavas*, or a blink. -   a **kshanas** is 3 *nimeshas*. -   a **kashthas** is 5 *kshanas*, or about 8 seconds. -   a **laghu** is 15 *kashthas*, or about 2 minutes. -   15 **laghus** make one *nadika*, which is also called a *danda*.
    This equals the time before water overflows in a six-pala-weight
    \[fourteen ounce\] pot of copper, in which a hole is bored with a
    gold probe weighing four masha and measuring four fingers long. The
    pot is then placed on water for calculation. -   2 **dandas** make one *muhurta*. -   6 or 7 **dandas** make one *yamah*, or 1/4th of a day or night. -   4 **praharas** or 4 **yamas** are in each *day* or each *night*
