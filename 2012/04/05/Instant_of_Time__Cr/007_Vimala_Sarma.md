Dear friends  
This is an extract from the Sanghabhedavastu sUtra of the mUlasarvastivādins (Gilgit manuscript).

The context is: After the liberation of one of this disciples Kaundinya, at the moment the of the turning of the wheel of dharma by the Buddha, the proclamation (of the dharma) was heard by the earth yakshas...

bhaumānāṃ yakṣāṇāṃ śabdaṃ śrutvā antarikṣāvacarā yakṣās \<tam anuśrāvayanti> cāturmahārājakāyikā devāḥ trāyastriṃśā yāmās tuṣitā nirmāṇaratayaḥ paranirmitavaśavartino devāḥ;  
tena kṣaṇena, teṇa lavena, tena muhūrtena, tena kṣaṇalavamuhūrtena (A 392a) yāvad brahmalokaṃ śabdo 'gamat; brahmakāyikā devāḥ śabdam udīrayanti; ghoṣam anuśrāvayanti":

... the yaksas of the middle region (atmosphere) having heard the sound, the devas of the 4 great kings (the four directions), the devas of the 33, and (gods of various other worlds, etc ... ); at the very moment, that instant, that hour, at the fash of that instant of the hour, the sound went as far as Brahmaloka, and gods of the Brahma world heard the proclamation..
