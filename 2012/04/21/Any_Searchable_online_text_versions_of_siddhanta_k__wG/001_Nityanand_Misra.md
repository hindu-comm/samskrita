<http://avg-sanskrit.org/> has searchable texts of several works including Kashika and Kaumudi. A sample page is here  
<http://avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=sutras:8-1-4>  
which has a search box as well on the right where you can search by typing Unicode devnagari  
  
You can also google search with the suffix "site:[sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org)", since the entire Unicode Kaumudi is on that site, e.g. see <http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/1.1.1.htm> . Substitute 1.1.1 for the Sutra number and you get the corresponding Sutra. I do not know if they have a special page for searching the Kaumudi and other commentaries.
