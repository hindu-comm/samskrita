Namaste,  
  
Śrīrāghavābhyudayam (literally, The sunrise of Rāma) is a single-act Samskrita play in four scenes composed by Swami Rambhadracharya. The play is set in the backdrop of the Bālakāṇḍam of the Rāmāyaṇa.  
  
The play was published (with a Hindi commentary by the playwright) by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas in 1996. A scan of the book is now available for free download under <http://goo.gl/4NN68> \[4.5 MB\].  
  
The play has been performed several times by disabled students of the Handicapped University in Chitrakoot. Attached are two snaps from a recent performance of Scene III. In the first one, the playwright can be seen enacting the role of Vasiṣṭha.  
  
A brief summary of the scenes is below  
  
Scene I. In the Āśrama of Vasiṣṭha, Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva talk about why the former is despondent over the Raghu princes returning to Ayodhyā after their learning. When Vasiṣṭha asks for his Dakṣiṇā, Rāma pledges to annihilate Rāvaṇa and other Rākṣasas.  
  
Scene II: In the Āśrama of Viśvāmitra in Siddhāśrama, Viśvāmitra is stopped by his disciples from the fire-sacrifice due to the interruptions by the Rākṣasas. Viśvāmitra meditates and then departs to Ayodhyā to ask for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, instructing his disciples to protect Siddhāśrama till he is back.  
  
Scene III: The Raghu princes return from the Gurukula. Viśvāmitra arrives in the court of Daśaratha and asks Kausalyā the permission to seat Rāma in his lap. From the postscenium, Adṛśyantī tells Kausalyā not to give Rāma to the killer of the sons of Vasiṣṭha. Heeding to Arundhatī, Adṛśyantī pardons Viśvāmitra. Viśvāmitra asks Daśaratha for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa for his protection, Daśaratha is reluctant but relents on Vasiṣṭha's advice. The two princes depart with Viśvāmitra.  
  
Scene IV: On the way to Siddhāśrama, Tāṭakā attacks the trio and is killed by Rāma. Viśvāmitra teaches the Balā and Atibalā Vidyās to the princes. In Siddhāśrama, the disciples begin the sacrifice and are interrupted by Mārīca and Subāhu. Mārīca is cast away and Subāhu is destroyed, the Gandharvas sing paeans to the two princes. The Abhyudaya (sunrise) of Rāma is complete.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
