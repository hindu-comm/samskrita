Dear all,  
  
Not sure whether I can discuss this here, I couldn't keep it myself so  
sharing here. It seems [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) - the Sanskrit-English  
dictionary website is down since the last few days.  
  
I have been using this website handy and its been very useful - I  
refer to it atleast minimum 10 times a day. The other dictionary  
websites are not so user friendly.  
  
If anyone here know, whether the site will be up and running anytime  
soon or any other information as to why the site is down would be much  
appreciated.  
  
Dhanyavada:  
Srikanth.
