Bhat Sir,

  

I had downloaded only the Devanagari version from [sanskritworld.in](http://sanskritworld.in). It does not have any translation or commentary. I was merely glancing through this work, when I noticed the word कर्णवर्त्म which was totally new to me. Hence the query.

  

As you assumed Gauravibhu must be Sri Chaitanya who is also known as Gauranga.



regards  
shankara
