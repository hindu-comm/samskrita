यतोऽयमध्यात्मपथैकपान्थः

स विप्रमुख्यः प्रभुपादसङ्गात।

मोक्षस्य नामापि न कर्णवर्त्म

नयत्यसौ गौरविभोः कृपैषा ॥९०॥

  

Thanks for all for offering the translation for the query. But I could not neither follow the translation to the text nor understand the text according to any translation I can imagine.

  

Please try to fit the SOV order first and then try to translate.

  

I could not understand the word गौरबिभु and who is he either the Chaitanya or some other deity. The second half is wholly syntactically related and the translations do not give any consistent meaning from the syntactical order. Without understanding the context and purport of the second half, it is difficult to translate unless a standard translation is provided by the Chaitanya School publishers themselves.

With regards
