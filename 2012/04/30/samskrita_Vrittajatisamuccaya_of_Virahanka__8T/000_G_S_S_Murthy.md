Dear all,

A paper by Parmanand Singh “Fibonacci numbers in India” refers to a”Vrittajatisamuccaya” by Virahanka with a commentary by Gopala edited by Sri.Velankar \[1962}.

I shall feel obliged if any in this group could guide me on its availability over the web or as a printed copy.

Regards

Murthy
