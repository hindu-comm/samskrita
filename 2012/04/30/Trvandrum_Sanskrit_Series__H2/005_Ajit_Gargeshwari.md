The entire series was not publishes in 1905. Several of the books were republished under Antasayna Indological series of Kerla Unversity. Arth Shastra published with T Ganapati Shastri in 3 volumes was Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan as a late as 1990. I am not an expert on copyrights,
but I can say is that Mr. Eshwaran is not an authorized seller of TSS series books he says that I did verify with him.
