Dear Suder,  
  
Just as i suspected The person Mr. Eshwaran sells photocopies of the books published by TSS. He is not authorized by publisher of the series. Please be careful before you give such information to members.
[cbh...@md3.vsnl.net.in.]() is not valid. I sopke with M.Easwaran at 919244561059 though he sounded genuine, he sell pshotocopies, strictly speaking one is not suppose to sell photocopies unless one is authorised by the orginal publisher to do so.  
  
I donot understand how respected scholars can back such claims ( I would have supported such claims if there was no monetary considerations involved)  
  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
