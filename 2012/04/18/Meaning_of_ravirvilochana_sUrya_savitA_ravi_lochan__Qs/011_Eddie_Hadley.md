Samba,



Re śubhra

 • mf(ā)n. radiant, shining, beautiful, splendid, ṚV. &c. &c.



 There is physics, there is metaphysics (philosophy) and there is religion.



 And then there is the somewhat lesser category of knowledge that is is pseudo science, which rather than illuminating matters, tends to shadow them.



I quote:

“Even today, there are intelligible and credible people who question the veracity or wisdom of Einstein's special theory of relativity which just says the world behaves this way but does not give any explanation as to why it behaves like that (i'm talking about the invariance of speed of light or what is popularly called constancy of speed of light).”



As someone with an old friend from school days who began his career by conducting satellite experiments to detect cosmic radiation to look for evidence of black holes, I can assure you that the speed of light is certainly not ‘invariant’.

It travels slower through transparent matter such as air or glass. And It has severe problems when it encounters dense material.



With the Veda, the laws of physics do not apply, the appeal is to the soul, not the intellect.



Eddie
