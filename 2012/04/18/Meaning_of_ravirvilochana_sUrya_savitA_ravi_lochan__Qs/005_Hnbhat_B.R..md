It is a recent trend to read the modern knowledge of science into Vedic Science into any vedic passage changing the traditional interpretations as foolish and ignorant ones of modern Science.

  

Everybody is free to read his own knowledge into Vedic passages as the words are not in common usage like every theory of physics, astronomy is not know to any laymant except the scientists.
