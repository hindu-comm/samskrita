I'm trying to say that the Vedhas are indeed scientific treatises, be it physics or medicine or metallurgy or mathematics or astronomy or cosmology.

  

It is not that I'm trying to justify the vedhic literature by drawing parallels to the modern day science as we know it, on the contrary I'm trying to draw the attention of the masters that the vedhic literature has lot of unexplored scientific treatises which the modern science may not have answers to.

  

For example, the very same sooktham that I have talked about "Savitha Sooktham" also explains the the presence of ether and the relative motion of ether while the light travels through it.I would want scientific minded folks to recollect that Einstein has not disproved ether but said that its presence or absence may not have nay profound impact on our understanding of science. Even today, there are intelligible and credible people who question the veracity or wisdom of Einstein's special theory of relativity which just says the world behaves this way but does not give any explanation as to why it behaves like that (i'm talking about the invariance of speed of light or what is popularly called constancy of speed of light).

  

I'm pretty poor in Samskrit but with what I understood from the various Bhaashyas, translations,etc I can tell that the vedhic literature talks about so many scientfic treatiseslike the Naasadeeya sooktham. If one reads that one gets a feeling like the rushi who wrote that sookthm is writing a thesis:

  

"Until now the secret mysteries of the creation of the universe has been eluding us but the recent efforts of our rushees have given us more clues into the the formation of the universe and what happened at that time."-- this is how the Naasadeeya Sooktham goes. is it not the same way our modern cosmologists write theories about the astronomical phenomenon?

  

It is reported by H.A. Griffith (one of the translators of Rug Vedham) that the Sulabha Soothras describe the speed of light as 2202 Yojajanas per (liptha) half the time of flapping an eyelid.

  

Considering that the flapping an eyelid takes 1/5 a second, half of that becomes 1/10th of a second. Now the wikipedia says a yojana was 13-15 kilomters during the vedhic period, the speed of the light becomes 2,86,260 KM/S -3,30,300 KM/S.

  

Is it not a discovery that is enough to startle thephysicistsof today for the modern world came to know of speed of light to that accuracy only in 17 hundreds which our rushees have written down in simple formulas (sulabha soothras) thousands of years ago.

  

And so is this wave theory of light that is explained in clear terms in Savitha Sooktham. All this makes sense if Savitha can be equated with Sun light.

  

So, my question is : keeping the agreements or disagreements aside about the scientificinterpretationsof the vedhic literature, can the verse i quoted be interpreted as :

  

Ravi being the eye of Sun (perhaps "heat"), while Savitha is the sight (light) of Ravi?

  

I would request the Samskrith pundits to please consider this from an unbiased view...

  

Thanks and Regards,

Samba
