I'm presenting here my interpretation of a few verses (in no particular order) of Savitha Sooktham from Rug Vedham.  
  

Savitha Sooktham   
  

आक्रुष्णेन रजसा वर्तमानो निवेशयन्नम्रुतं मर्त्यंच

हिरण्ययेन सवितारधेनादेवो याति भुवना निपश्यन्

> 
> > The Sun-Light is coming to us, again and again, through the dark outer > space on a pure golden chariot illuminating objects that come in its > way thus differentiating the living from the non-living. >
> 
> > 
> > It is to be noted that the Sun is not coming towards the earth, it is > the Sun's light that is coming towards us. >
> 

  
याति देवः प्रवतायात्युद्वता याति शुभ्राभ्याम यजतोहरिभ्याम

 आदेवो यातिसविता परावतोअप विश्वादुरिता बादमान:  

> 
> > The god(dess) of sun(light) comes to earth ascending and descending by > taking the forms of (seven) pure horses (colors); the goddess comes > from very far off places to shed the troubles of this world (by > illuminating the obstacles).  
>   
> If we presume that Savitha is Sun light, it can be easily understood > that the Sun light is consists of (driven by)seven pure colours > (horses), which is actually explaining the phenomenon of VIBGYOR. >
>   
> It is unfortunate that the modern scholars (including Saayana > Aachaarya), having interpreted Savitha as Sun, explained this verse as > if the Sun appears rising up until noon and then appears falling till > the evening. >
> 

> Actually, the **ascent and descent of the (sun) light** travelling > from Sun to Earth can be explained by the fact that the **light > travels in the form of transverse waves (crests and troughs)**; the > wave nature of light being established in next verse.

विसुपर्णो अन्तरिक्षाण्य्खत् गभीर वेपा असुरः सुनीदः  
क्वेइदानीम् सूर्यःकस्चिकेत कतमान्द्याम् रस्मिरस्याततानः  

> 
> > The straight rays of sun-light illuminating the outer space travel at > **very high frequency**; does anyone know where the Sun goes to during > nights and which worlds it illuminates? >
> 

येथे पन्थाः सवितः पूर्व्यासो अरेणवः सुक्रुता अन्तरिक्षे  
तेभिर्नो अद्यपधिभिः सुगेभी रक्षाचनो अधिच ब्रूहिदेव

> 
> > The paths in which the Sun-Light travels were established long before, > well-formed, and are **devoid (free) of any particles**. O goddess of > light, come across the space and illuminate our world >
> 

Another interesting note can be drawn from the Sarpa Sooktham from Yajur Vedham which explains the wave motion of light by drawing a parallel to the crawling or a snake; that slokam purports to worship the snakes in the sky because the Sun(light) travels through the Vyomam or Antha Riksham with the help of snakes (waves).  
  
It is sad tale that the nation which first explained to the world about he wave nature of light thousands of years ago have been mocked at as a nation of snake charmers!.  
  
Is my interpretation faulty? doesn't these verses talk about sun light, travelling a t a very high speed, and with the highest frequency, with the medium (ether, which i'll explain later) trembling violently when the light passes through it, coming to earth in the form of transverse waves (having crests and troughs, i.e. ups and downs)?  
  
Isn't Sarpa Sooktham a tribute to the wave nature of light which is actually explained in Savitha Sooktham?  
  
Dear experts, please read through those verses a few times and judge whether this hypothesis can stand critical examination!  
  
Thanks and Regards,  
Samba
