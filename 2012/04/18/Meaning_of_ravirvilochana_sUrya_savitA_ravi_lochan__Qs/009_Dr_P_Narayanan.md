Dear Samba,

  

It is not रविर्विलोचन सूर्य: सविता रवि लोचन:, but रविर्विरोचनः सूर्य: सविता रविलोचन:।

The meaning you try to put forward “Ravi is the "eye" of Soorya while Savitha is the "sight" of "Ravi"” is neither grammatically feasible nor logical.

Your hypothesis brings to my mind a “hypothesis” once put forward by one of my friends in my first year of study of B.A.M.S. course. There is a verse in Charaka Samhita, which reads:

खादीन्यात्मा मनः कालो दिशश्च द्रव्यसंग्रहः ।

which roughly translates as “In brief the dravyas are the five mahabhUtas starting from kha (आकाश), Atman, manas, kAla and dik (thus nine)”. My friend, who is a blatant anti-Congress postulated the meaning of the verse like this: खादीनि= those who wear Khadi, आत्मा मनः कालः= spirit and mind are black, दिशश्च द्रव्यसंग्रहः= collect properties from all the directions. When I started objecting pointing first that the word खादीनि is in neuter gender and therefore cannot mean “those who wear Khadi”, the friend replied, “ The Sage meant much of contempt to those persons and therefore did not want to use masculine or even feminine gender to describe them”, whereupon I made a hasty retreat with tight lips. Such hypotheses can serve no more purpose than adding to a stock of jokes.
