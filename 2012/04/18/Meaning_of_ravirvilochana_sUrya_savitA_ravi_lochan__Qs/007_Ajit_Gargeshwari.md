Science has its domain so has our Vedas, Reading twentieth century science into our Vedas makes no sense. Why does Vedas have to satisfy science? Its a science by itself and its scope and is well defined. Please understand the scope of Vedas it domain is not explain science neither does it it seek support from science nor does our Vedas need support of science. Its complete by itself.
