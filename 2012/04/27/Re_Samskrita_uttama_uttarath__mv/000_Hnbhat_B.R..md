There is no need of splitting into parts just because of gramnmar when the meaning is clear without the analysis and the actual usage is far away from the analysis.

  

Compared to comparative and superlative suffixes, they are added to adjectives generally attributive ones to show the comparison.

  

Compared to sundara+rara and sundara+tama there are independent usages of sundaraH, while there is no usage of ut as an adjective or verb as it is a prefix to any verb. Hence there is no use of uttara and uttama according to the rule prescribing these two suffixes.

  

I don't think one would understand anything by splitting these two words as comparative and superlative degrees, as it would not any meaningful sentence ayam anayoH atishayena ut - gives the meaning of uttaraH or ayam eshAm atishayena ut - gives the meaning of uttama,

  

while the scripture gives a definition of uttama  
  

uttamaH puruShastu anyaH paramAtmetyudAhRutaH

  

mithilAm uttareNa does not have any meaning by splitting as tarap suffix for the word uttara.

  

  

  

This is my sincere opinion and the intention of Manidravida shastri also by taking it as a rUDhi even if etymology is sought.
