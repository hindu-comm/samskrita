I don't understand precisely what do you want.

  

You say you are a beginner and try to make a wide survey of dhatu-s in Sanskrit.

  

Beginners have so many tools online available according to their taste and capacity. Here is one verb generator online"

  

<http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/tinanta/tinanta.jsp>  

  

if you are interested to generate verbal forms. If you already know the section of grammar dealing with verbs, you can use this following the Paninian rules to derive the forms as given in this book navigating through the scanned pages with th indexed verbs"

  

<http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvindx/disp/mdhv_index.html>  

  

Usually there are web pages with declined forms ready made as the one provided by Murthy G:SS

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/>  

  

  

For a beginner, any list of conjugated verbs and nominal declensions like shabdamanjari or dhatumanjari woiuld do. For advanced learner, there is a comparative list of dhatu-s according to different traditions is available online ibn Sanskrit Documents list and also some scanned book..Choice is yours
