Namaste

  

I am beginner in learning samskrita and I request the following help. I apologize if this particular request has appeared many times in this group. I searched the group but did not find the exact thing that I wanted.

  

I have been following many books (3) so far and I find many verbs scattered with their dhatus in these books. I have been maintaining a separate book where I note down the verb and its dhatu. I was wondering if there is some ready made material (either as a book or an online link) where they have a long list of verbs with their corresponding dhatus. Also it will be nice to know if the different lakaras of the verb is also provided.

  

If there is any such thing that even closely resembles this please do let me know.

  

Thank you for any help that you can provide
