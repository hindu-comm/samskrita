I came across this one scanned copy of Madhaviya Dhatu Vrutti...  
  
<http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvscan/disp/index.php>  
  
This has the dhatu, and the most of the lakara rupa given. Not sure if  
there are any other similar or laghu version of dhatu vritti  
available...
