namo namah,  
  
Over the last weekend, my wife Sarada and I felt the need to quickly navigate ashtadhyayi sutras in siddhanta kaumudi as well as panini order, to help her with her MA Sanskrit exam. Flipping through physical books was an awful experience.  
  
I searched over the web, I found sutra lists, but not linked, commentaries but no index to navigate with,  
and no siddhanta kaumudi ordering or searchable text that is complete enough. There's a very good ashtadhyayi web interface at the U of Heidelberg with detailed classification of rules/stems, but it has many missing sutras.  
  
So I have created a consolidated index out of the disparate ones available on [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) and put it there itself:  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/>  
  
I didn't type anything new, but just made existing ones more usable. I've linked each sutra to two commentaries: Ajit Krishnan's and AVG-sanskrit.org. I have also published the resulting Excel spreadsheet to Google Docs as well.  
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aocnp1cX4xG8dGh5Q0JaX21WYTZ0MktsRVQ3NzVON0E>  
  
I'd appreciate it if someone can fill in the "sutra type" column in there as well as indicate the sphere of influence of adhikaara sutras for easy comprehension.  
  
A browsable interface to navigate the semantic structure of ashtadhyayi will greatly ease the student's life, in my experience.  
Regards,  
- Sai.

Subject: Re: \[Samskrita\] Any Searchable online text versions of siddhanta kaumudi and kaashikaa ??  
To: [sams...@googlegroups.com]()  
  
  
<http://avg-sanskrit.org/> has searchable texts of several works including Kashika and Kaumudi. A sample page is here  
<http://avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=sutras:8-1-4>  
which has a search box as well on the right where you can search by typing Unicode devnagari  
  
You can also google search with the suffix "site:[sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org)", since the entire Unicode Kaumudi is on that site, e.g. see <http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/1.1.1.htm> . Substitute 1.1.1 for the Sutra number and you get the corresponding Sutra. I do not know if they have a special page for searching the Kaumudi and other commentaries.
