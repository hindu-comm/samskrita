Namaste,  
Your work is great help with respect to navigation.  
What book are you using to find out type of stura?  
I was looking for such a document, which has sutra type, its short  
english and sanskrit meaning as well for each sutra in Astadhyaayi.  
I found open office excel sheet on Sanskritdoucments may be created by  
you with english meaning taken out of Srisa Chandra Vasu  
I am using web sources to fill in one or two line meaning in sanskrit  
to the document.  
regards  
Raama
