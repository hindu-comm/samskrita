Would I be correct if I observe that not only Sanskrit, but other languages of the Indo-European family have this feature common - that their 'we' is used to denote the speakers only or the speakers and those addressed and only the context tells how to distinguish between these situations. The five languages that I know (English, Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi and Russian) share this feature.
