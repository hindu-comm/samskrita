Comparative and superlative are formed by adding the suffixes तर (अतिशायने तमबिष्ठनौ ) and तम respectively to the positive form of adjective or Adverb ( Masculine तर:, तम:, Feminine =तारा, तमा and neuter = तरम् and तमम्)  
  
तर and तम are changed into तराम्  तमाम् respectively and are added to verbs and indeclinable.  
  
In some cases the suffixes ईयस् and इष्ठ ( Masculine ईयान् feminine , ईयसी Neuter ईयः; Masculine इष्ठ: Feminine इष्ठा and Neuter इष्ठम्) are added as suffixes to the positive form in order to make the comparitive and superlative respectively. In this precess some more chages may be effected in the body of the positive; ex removing its final Vowel or consonant and the preceding vowel or suffixes such as मत् or changing ऋ to र.
