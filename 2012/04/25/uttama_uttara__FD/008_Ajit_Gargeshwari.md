In general this is a good way to remember Degrees of Comparison  
  
Com and Sup are generally formed by adding तर and तम respectively to the positive form of the adjective or adverb and sometimes to derivative nouns, verbs and indeclinables. some times ईयस् and इष्ठ are added intead of तर and तम. तर and तम are sometimes added to com and sup forms ending in ईयस् and इष्ठ.  
  
Example सुन्दरः,सुन्दरतरः, सुन्दरतमः.  
उत्तम \[उद्-तमप्\] p is dropped as per rules of Panini  
उत्तर \[उद्-तरप्\] p is dropped as per rules of Panini  
  
There are several irregular comps and superlatives for which additional rules apply  
Example अन्तिकः नेदीयन् नेदेष्ट:  
For irregular forms usage is the best guide.
