No, that is not what it means. One of the derivations is exactly the tarap and tamap-like usage in sundaratara, -tama. As quoted previously - अतिशयेन उद्गतः । तरप् । gives uttara. It is the same tarap in sundaratara.  
  
Given that ud is hardly ever used by itself (perhaps it is used in the Vedas that way), Sudhya vyakhya uses udgataH (and not ud alone) to explain this.
