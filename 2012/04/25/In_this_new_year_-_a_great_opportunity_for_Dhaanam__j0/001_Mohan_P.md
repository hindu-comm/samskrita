I posted this message in our THANJAVUR MARATHI GROUP in FACEBOOK. I proposed that TMG as a group will.associate with the great cause of supporting this group. I am glad to tell that two members pledges- Shri Suresh Naig Rs 5000 Shri G Jayanta Rao Rs 2500/- I shall donate Rs 2000/-We all will be sending money individually.

  

I hope you maintain records ofdonors. If so our collective donations may be identifies under Thanjavur Marathi Group. This is a small favour we seek..

  

I am too lazy to write cheque and post it. It will help if your bank name, A/C no and NEFT codes of the branch is publicised. I shall make Epayment.

  

May I suggest that KSRI website may also publicise the needs for public support.

  

I sincerely hope God will support KSRI till eternity.
