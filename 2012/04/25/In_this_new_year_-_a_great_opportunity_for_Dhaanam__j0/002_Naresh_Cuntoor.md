\[Mod.note: \]  
  
There were several messages asking for Dr. K.S.Balasubramanian's email. If someone has it, and gets his ok to share it with the group, please post it.  
  
Otherwise, as posted previously, those interested may contact him at the following address posted earlier:  

Dr. K.S.Balasubramanian, Dy.Director, Kuppuswamy Sastri Research Institute, Sanskrit College, Mylapore, Chennai. Phone- 044-24985320  
  

We have rejected a few messages which asked for the same details. Further discussion like the Thanjavur Marathi group comment are best addressed off-the-list, directly with the parties concerned.  
  
Thanks,
