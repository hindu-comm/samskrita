"Re: Kaumudi Mahotsavam

Vijaya Bhattarika, born in a courtesan family,had her early education in Sanskrit, and authored the Kaumudi Mahotsavam, an historical Drama of Five Acts, in Sanskrit language. According to Rajashekhara, erudite in poetics, ' practically there were none, after the celebrated Kalidasa, who could compose so felicitously in the Vaidarbhi style as Vijaya Bhattarika' . she verily earned the cognomen of Karnata Sarasvati. Herslf being black in colour , she says" Dandi has described Sarasvati as white in colour. If he were to see me , he would have described Sarasvati as black!".

Vijaya Bhattarika had the other aliases of Vijjika, Vijayambika and Vijayakka.She is the earliest known poetess.She was queen consort of prince Chandraditya, eldest son of Polekesin II ( 610-642CE), King of the Imperial Chalukyas of Badami( Vatapi).Vijjika was a junior contemporary of Dandin, author of the Kavyadarsha, a treatise on poetics in Sanskrit.

She speaks of herself as Karnata Rajapriya , ' darling of the king of Karnata' .

Rajashekhara,versed in poetics, also refers to her as Karnati, ' lady of Karnata'.

Vijaya Bhattarika gifted land from Neruru, situated in the Savantavadi province governed by her husband prince Chandraditya.

From this reference it would seem that the Upanishad is older than Dandin's work.

The above verse is from सरस्वतीरहस्योपनिषत् .. as given in Sanskritdocuments list:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/sarasrah_sa.html>  

  

which appears as the benedictory verse of काव्यादर्श of दण्डिन् without any change and this is confirmed by a later women poetess as कुवलयदलश्यामां विज्जिकां मामजानता। वृथैव दण्डिना प्रोक्ता सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती। as I have read somewhere as the verse of Vijjaka or Vijjika. (right now I could not provide the source) though there are references to this poetess in sec.374 of History of Classical Literature. 

  

Does this mean दण्डिन् borrowed this benedictory verse from the उपनिषत् or the उपनिषत् is of a latter composition than काव्यादर्श?
