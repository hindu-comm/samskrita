Thanks for the link to the pages which contain the reference to the verse ascribed to Vijjika, as the junior contemporary of Dandin.

  

I stand corrected the verse quoted:

  

नीलोत्पलदलश्यामां for the first पाद I quoted. Yet the question is that of the verse

  

सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती is ascribed to Dandin than to सरस्वत्युपनिषत् by his junior contemporary who should have known that it is not belonging to Dandin.
