It is present in all the editions I have referred as the first verse of काव्यादर्श-

  

which is not missing any edition and which is confirmed by his contemporary poetess also than any present critical edition.

  

I can't follow what you are trying to make out.

  

The question arises when the same verse is present in the said सरस्वत्युपनिषत् and काव्यादर्श that only one could be the original composition and hence the topic is raised.
