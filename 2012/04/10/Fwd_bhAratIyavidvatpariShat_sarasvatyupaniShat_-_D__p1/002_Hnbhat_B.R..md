Thanks for the reference. My question was about the verse of statement

  

वृथैव दण्डिना प्रोक्ता सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती।

  

ascribed to the same विज्जिका as can be seen from the above reference, a junior contemporary of Dandin and if the quotation is to be attested as from her, then it would be a serious thing that who claimed herself as the incarnation of Sarasvati, didn't know that the verse was from the said Upanishad and not of Dandin's own as we can see in the the text of काव्यादर्श as the benedictory verse.

  

And that a great as per the legend, Dandin is also said to be declared by as kaviH;

  

"कविर्दण्डी कविर्दण्डी कव्रिर्दण्डी न संशयः।"

  

by the Goddess herself, as Dandin, according to legends, was made a poet by copying the verse from the Upanishad was not able to compose his own verse as मङ्गलश्लोक, is considered as a कवि.

  

Anyhow this is a line of thought. I am not passing any judgement on the issue. If Upanishad-s along with the वेद-s are said to be eternal, अपौरुषेय and नित्य, then there is no scope for the discussion whether it preceded or followed Dandin.

  

The Sringeri article throws light on the history worship of सरस्वती than anything else which cannot speak of a उपनिषद् as otherwise than नित्यः शब्दः.
