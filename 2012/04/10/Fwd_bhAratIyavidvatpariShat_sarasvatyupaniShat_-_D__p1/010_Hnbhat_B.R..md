Thanks to both Ajit and Sunder for their valuable responses. For your query, the one published from BORI, with Prabha Commentary is a critical Edition based on several manuscripts none of which omit this Mangala Sloka and the the Southern Edition with Krishnamurthy's translation also doesn't omit the Mangala Sloka.

  

Further, considering it as Interpolation, also would have to assume that Dandin, the great rhetorician and poet, didn't follow his own dictum "आशीर्नमस्क्रिया वापि तन्मुखम्।" which he prescribes generally for any composition though his work deals with Poems and also that the interpolation took place while he was living, to be quoted by his junior contemporary (not far removed in time) as Kane makes it clear. The only justifiable reason would be to highlight the अपौरुषेयत्व of the उपनिषत् even with these assumptions.

  

This just occurred to me as I saw the verse in the सरस्वत्युपनिषत् for the first time while Goggling for the benedictory verse of Kavyadarsha.

  

Thanks once again for sharing your opinions.
