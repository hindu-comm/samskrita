Dear Dr. Bhat,

  
  
"सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती is ascribed to Dandin than to सरस्वत्युपनिषत् by his junior contemporary who should have known that it is not belonging to Dandin."  
  

This is just a thought kindly correct me if I am wrong. Is there a critical edition of काव्यादर्श ? I understand that the existing editions don't have in them several verses quoted by other great writers of Alankara shastra. May be the original Mangala written by दण्डिन् is lost.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
