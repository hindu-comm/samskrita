Thanks for the reproduction of Whytney's grammar. I just quoted Panini's Grammar as didn't ever look into Whytney's Grammar or what he has said.

  

But according to Panini, the suffix आम् is added to the verbs formed with the suffixes listed as सनादि and also to some other verbs as listed in the list of verbs गणपाठ. There is no mention of accusative ending to a noun आ which is purely guess work of Whytney, whereas it is affixed to the verbal root (धातु), it makes a indeclinable noun अव्यय like कर्तुम्, गन्तुम्, etc. as gerunds.

I think Whytney would explain कर्तुम् etc. the accusative case ending of कर्तु or तु, गन्तु etc. of which form he can find dative - कर्तवे, कर्तवै, \[ni\]गन्तवः (Inrukta) as nominative plural added to the verb. Fine, It is Whytney's Grammar.

I have given the examples without desiderative meaning to the suffixes, listed as desiderative, causative, etc.

  

जुगुप्सांचक्रे, गोपायांबभूव, तितिक्षांचक्रे etc. तितिक्षा doesn't have anydesiderative meaning in itself. In the same way, the suffix णिच् is added to the 10th class, without causative meaning. The suffix is used as denominative also similar in form, but added to nouns, like मुण्ड, मिश्र with different meaning added to the words. Hence मुण्डयति - means मुण्डं करोति, श्लोकैः उपस्तौति - उपश्लोकयति etc.

  

Thanks for both introducing me to the Grammar of Whytney.
