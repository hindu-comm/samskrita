W.D.Whitney has made a few remarks about how words like धारयामास,  
कथयामास etc. are formed. I reproduce them below as an additional  
input.

Paragraph 1045. Perfect. The accepted causative perfect is the  
periphrastic (1071a); a derivative noun in आ is made from the  
causative stem, and to its accusative, in आम्, is added the auxiliary:  
thus,

धारयांचकार (or धारयामास)  
धारयांचक्रे

Of this perfect no examples occur in RV, or SV, only one - गमयांचकार -  
in AV, and but half-a-dozen in all the various texts of the Black  
Yajur-Veda, and these not in the mantra-parts of the text. They are  
also by no means frequent in the Brahmanas, except in SB. (where they  
abound: chiefly, perhaps, for the reason that this work uses in  
considerable part the perfect instead of the imperfect as its  
narrative tense).

Paragraph 1071a. It is the accepted perfect of the derivative  
conjugations: intensive, desiderative, causative, and denominative;  
the noun in आ being made from the present-stem which is the general  
basis of such conjugation: thus, from root बुध्, intensive बोबुधाम्,  
desiderative बुभुत्साम्, causative बोधयाम्, denominative मन्त्रयाम्.
