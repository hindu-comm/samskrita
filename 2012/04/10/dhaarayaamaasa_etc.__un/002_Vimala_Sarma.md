Dear Srikāntha Mahodaya  
There is a class of verbs which do not or cannot reduplicate to form the perfect. These are 10 class - aya verbs, and they form what is called the periphrastic perfect - ie the perfect with two parts. First they take the feminine accus ending ām, and then perfect of a auxiliary verb is added to it - the auxiliary is usually the perfect of kṛ, as, or bhū but usually is the perfect of as ie āsa and only a few take cakāra. So we have bodhāyāmāsa - he did awakening or he awoke, or he told, or he placed, in your examples.
