There is no feminine accusative case ending आम्, as they are roots to which verb forming suffixes are added as I have already noted in my message.

  

The rule is very simple They are affixed to the verb कास्, and verbs derived with a verb forming suffixes:

  

चकासाञ्चकार। दरिद्राञ्चकार। चुलुम्पाञ्चकार।

  

etc. are extended usages.

  

सन् (सन्,क्यच्,काम्यच्, क्यङ्, क्यष्, णिङ्, णिच्, यङ्, यक्, आय, ईयङ्)called सनादि-suffixes forming verbs are listed under "सनाद्यन्ता धातवः"and the present 10 conjugation is also prescribed णिच्, before the conjugation and again treated as verb derived with a suffix. Hence all the verbs conjugated in the class take the अनुप्रयोग of कृ, भू and अस्/ In other verbs listed in the rules 

  

3.1.36-39 will take the अनुप्रयोग of the three verbs as per the 40th सुत्र in the same sequence.

There is no such option between the three than only one can be used at a time.

  

But after desiderative it would the "pada" of the original verb.
जुगुप्सति - जुगुप्सते

जुगुप्सां चक्रे,जुगुप्साम् बभूव etc. are other than गोपायामास, गोपायाम् बभूव etc. are other than the 10th conjugation verbs. Like this, the णिच् is affixed to the verbs in 10th conjugation without any change in the meaning of the original verb.
