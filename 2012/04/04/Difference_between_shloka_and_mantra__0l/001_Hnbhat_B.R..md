In other words, Sloka is always a verse which can be a "mantra" composed in metrical stanza-s or any thing one would like to compose to express his idea-s, i.e. poetry. But "mantra" can be either composed in metrical structure a श्लोक or in any prose form or in Vedic meters as in Veda-s or in prose.

  

This is the simplest explanation for both. Depends on the usage of the term. श्लोक usually denotes अनुष्टुप् with four stanza, but Vedic metres begin from with single lettered "paada" up to three to four paada-s. Both can be "mantra" in that they can be used for meditation.
