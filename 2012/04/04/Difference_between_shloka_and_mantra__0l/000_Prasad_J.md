Dear members,

  

I was wondering that sometimes verses in scriptures are mentioned as śloka and sometimes as mantra. And I thought that mantras are subtler than ślokas. Śloka can be any verse written by anyone but mantra is a verse meant to deliver the mind.

  

May be learned members of this group can put more light on this.

  

Thanks,

Prasad J.
