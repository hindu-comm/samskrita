Prasad Sir,  
Some sixty tears ago I had asked the same question to my Sanskrit teacher in school (he was only a BA with Sanskrit as his subsidiary subject and English his principal but it seems people of that generation were capable of indulging in great in-depth studies of the subject of their choice, at least that is the impression I have in my mind). His explanation was that a shloka is normally a chantable metrical composition, and it usually refers to the "external"; it contains either an advice,or a praise (stuti)for a god or goddess,or it contains a prayer or it is a description of a phenomenon. A mantra, on the other hand, is more directed to the "internal" and it contains, in most cases, an auto-suggestion; something to control the mind with and give it a direction. As an example, he had said, the savitru gayatri is a mantra and like most manta-s, the chanter has to immerse himself in the qualities mentioned in it(shivo bhUtvA shivam bhajet like)to derive the desired benefit. The "om" by itself,as also "soham", "ahambhrahmAsmi" etc are vedic mantras while a mantra like "om namaH shivAya" is a puranic (pourANic)mantra; and chantings like "bhrahmAnandam paramasukhadam kevalamdnyanamurtim  
.......tasmai shrI gurave namaH" would qualify as shloka-s. Scholars, of course, might be able to throw more light on the topic (This is because, in this regard, I have not grown from where I was sixty years ago!).
