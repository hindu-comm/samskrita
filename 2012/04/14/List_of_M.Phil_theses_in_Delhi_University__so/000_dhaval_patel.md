Respected scholar,

please find attached the list of M.Phil theses of Delhi University from 2000 to 2011 which I received as a response to RTI.

The list of Ph. D and D.Lit are available at [www.sanskrit.nic.in](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in), but M.Phil list is not available.

Hope you will find it useful for your studies.

If I get more info about other universities, I will keep you posted
