सूर-सूर्या-\[र्य-अर्यम(\[न्\]+आदित्य-द्वादशात्म\[न्\]दिवाकराः ।

  

I can't understand your doubt as the compound is formed of the above words forming a द्वन्द्व in समाहार.

  

As I can see there is no room for any doubt as it is perfect as all compounded words lose their case-ending and especially नलोपः प्रातिपदिकान्यस्य. as in the previous word अर्यमन्, also in द्वादशात्मन्. प्रत्ययलक्षणेन पदत्वम्, प्रादिपदिकत्वम्, तदन्त्स्य नकारस्य लोप एव।

  

You can refer to the commentaries under the above said rule in Manorama and others. There is no chance to elongate the अ as in the case of अर्यम\[न्\]आदित्य- अर्यमादित्य as there is not any vowel, but only consonant of दिवाकर.

  

Hope this makes the position clear. Here is the link to the above said सूत्र:
