namo namaH,

  

This issue often comes up. You hear a "name" and you are told that it means "..." in samskritam.

You usually take it for granted, but have really no means of finding it out. There may be several reasons:

1- What you hear as name is an "apabhraMshaH" of the original word.

2- The way the apabhraMshaH work in spoken languages makes it hard to find the root.

3- Slew of websites give several meanings to the word and authentic documents don't provide anything conclusive.

  

Have you run into such issue? If yes, what is your advice to go about it?

  

bhavadIyaH,

kedAraH.
