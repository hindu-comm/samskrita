Namaste Nityanand Mahodaya,

This is very useful. In addition it looks like Rasthriya Sanskrit Sansthan will eventually turn this into a live database - on their site they are inviting scholars to add their details to the list -<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/wiw.htm>. They were also due to publish a list of Sanskrit institutions this year, has anyone seen that?

Dhanyavada
