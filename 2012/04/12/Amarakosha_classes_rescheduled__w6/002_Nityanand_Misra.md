Aditya Mahodaya  
  
In fact the MP3 of Svargavarga is quite good to listen to - if you can share all other recordings, it would be great.  
  
Unfortunately I do not have time to join the group recitation (which I think is a splendid effort), but I can listen these MP3s while commuting to and from office.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
