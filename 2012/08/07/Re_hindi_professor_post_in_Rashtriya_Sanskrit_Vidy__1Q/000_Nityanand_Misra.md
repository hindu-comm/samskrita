A check on the website of RSV Tirupati shows that it is a real posting. See below  
  
<http://rsvidyapeetha.ac.in/fss.htm>  
  
The "Faculty of Sahitya and Samskriti" has the following departments:  
  
Department of Sahitya with 11 professors  
Department of Puranetihasa with one professor  
Department of English with two professors  
Department of Telugu with two professors  
Department of Hindi with one professor  
  
I don't know why a Samskrita university in Tirupati having a Hindi professor would be "unbelievable", "a typo", or "a matter of high value". If the university can have a Department of English, why not one for Hindi? I agree it would have been a concern if it had a Department of Hindi and not a Department of Telugu - that would not be proper.  
  
I am not in favour imposing Hindi, but if India is to emerge as one strong country, a good knowledge of three languages (a global language, a national language and a regional language) would be beneficial. English is the only global language, and we cannot afford to ignore it today. While I am personally in favour of Samskrita being the national language, this will never materialize due to political reasons. Hindi is the *de facto* national language (it is not officially or *de jure* the national language, but neither is cricket officially our national sport), and is the language of all historical and current national movements that cut across states - be it Gandhi's freedom struggle, Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, Subhash Bose's revolutionary army, Rashtriya Swayamsevaka Sangha, Ram Janmabhoomi movement, or Anna Hazare's movement - incidentally none among Mohandas Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Lal Krishna Advani or Anna Hazare had/have their mother tongue as Hindi. But their movements which had/have pan-India appeal reached people primarily through Hindi. Given this, it would be beneficial for the country if regional language speakers learn Hindi and Hindi speakers learn one regional language.  
  
Our powerful neighbour China has as much diversity in races and languages as India. After ignoring English for a long time, it is also moving to the three-language system (English-Mandarin-Cantonese/Hakka/Mongol/etc) - many Cantonese speakers in Guangdong avoid or dislike learning and speaking in Mandarin - just like our country. It is perfectly natural and is fine as long as there is no imposition or linguistic chauvinism, else we are back to blackening signboards and fighting over which state gets to keep the villages in Belgaum.
