These were noted by the original uploader at [archive.org](http://archive.org) :  
  
Page 226 of Chapter 14, Page 853 of Chapter 63, Page 1027 of Chapter 66, Pages 1063, 1074, 1075 of Chapter 68 are missing. Many pages with unclear edges.  
  
These are now made available to us by svAmI nIlakaNThAnanda giri and are uploaded [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B28FMx5lr-reMXZ1ckNLQ0wzNnM).  
  
For pages with dark edges, we need page numbers first to start capturing photos.
