Respected Devotees,*

*Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.*

*For those devotees who are adept at reading Sanskrit and wish to relish Srimad Bhagavatam, I’ve managed to upload all twelve cantos of a book called Aneka Vyakhya Samalankrita Srimad Bhagavatam, which means ‘Srimad Bhagavatam with Multiple Sanskrit Commentaries’.*

*This book contains all the verses of the Srimad Bhagavatam with commentaries in Sanskrit by 11 Acharyas of different Vaishnava Sampradayas, including Srila Sridhar Swami, Srila Jiva Goswami, Srila Vishvanatha Cakravarti Thakura etc.*

*10th canto is missing some pages and has some bad pages. I hope to get pictures of missing pages. But, I'm not certain about bad pages. Even counting them will be of much help.*
