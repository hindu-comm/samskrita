नमांसि,

न राज्यं न च राजासीत् । न दाण्ड्यो न च दाण्डिकः ।  
धर्मेणैव प्रजाः सर्वाः । रक्षन्ति स्म परस्परम् ॥

अयं श्लोकः कुत्र वर्तते ?

---------------------------  
I heard the following highly quoted sentences of Lord Macaulay have no  
reference to an origininal source. Is it true?

"I have traveled across the length and breadth of India and I have not  
seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief. Such wealth I have  
seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such calibre,  
that I do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we  
break the very backbone of this nation, which is her spiritual and  
cultural heritage, and, therefore, I propose that we replace her old  
and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians think  
that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their  
own, they will lose their self-esteem, their native self-culture and  
they will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation."
