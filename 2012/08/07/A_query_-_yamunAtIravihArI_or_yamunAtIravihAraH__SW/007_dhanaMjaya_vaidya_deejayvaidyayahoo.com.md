Either seems correct when referring to the person (kRShNa).  
यमुनातीरविहारी is a tatpuruSha compound  
यमुनातीरविहारः is a bahuvrIhi compound. (The problem is because we do not currently read saMskRta with svara accents. Without svara accents, this word could also be a tatpuruSha meaning "picnic on the bank of the Yamuna", rather than the bahuvrIhi "one who picnics on the bank of the Yamuna".)
