Dear friend, Namaskar.  
For getting Shiv Shambhu as her husband,Parvati underwent more and more rigorous penance.Ultimately she gave up eating even the edible leaves, on which she was sustaining.Hence she got this title and also Lord Shiva in marriage. Hence she is referred to as APARNA.  
Ram,Ram.
