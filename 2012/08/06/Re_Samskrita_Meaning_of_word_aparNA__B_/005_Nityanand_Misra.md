The same explanation is to be found in the Rāmacaritamānasa of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa.  
  
संबत सहस मूल फल खाए । शाक खाइ शत बरष गँवाए ॥ १-७४-४ ॥  
कछु दिन भोजन बारि बतासा । किए कठिन कछु दिन उपवासा ॥ १-७४-५ ॥  
बेल पात महि परइ सुखाई । तीनि सहस संबत सोइ खाई ॥ १-७४-६ ॥  
पुनि परिहरे सुखानेउ परना । उमहिं नाम तब भयऊ अपरना ॥ १-७४-७ ॥  
  
A quick translation - During her penance, Umā subsisted on fruits and root for a thousand years. Then she spent a hundred years eating vegetables. For some days, she survived only on water and air. Then for some days she did not even take water or air performing a difficult fast. For three thousand years she ate only the dried leaves of the Bilva plant which had fallen down on the earth. Then she even left eating the dried leaves. It was then that the name of Umā became Aparṇā.
