This is the explanation given by कालिदास in his कुमारसंभवमहाकाव्य-

  

स्वयं विशीर्णद्रुमपर्णवृत्तिता परा हि काष्ठा तपसस्तया पुनः । तदप्यपाकीर्णमतः प्रियंवदां वदन्त्यपर्णेति पुराविदः॥5.26\|\|

  

नास्ति पर्णं तपस्यायां पर्णभक्षणवृत्तिर्वा - अपर्णा। इति शब्दकल्पद्रुमः।

  

Without leaves is the literal meaning. Literally he explains, though she used to live upon eating only the leaves fallen out of the trees and gradually she left it also she abandoned it and hence she is called अपर्णा not eating even the leaves.
