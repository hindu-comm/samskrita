Dear friends , can you help me with one shloka which I remember half and not full  
  
It is from Mahabharata , and it is about Karna , the first son Mata Kunti  
  
the first line , I dont remember . the second line says something like this  
  
  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, कुतो जन्मो , मद्दायुक्तं तु पोउरुषं  
  
the meaning is , it is not material or it is not in my hands in which family I am born ( whether the family is considered Noble like Brahmins or Low ) . What is in my hands is my own efforts and action  
  
Can you help me with the full shloka  
  
Thanks and regards  
  
Dipak Ashar
