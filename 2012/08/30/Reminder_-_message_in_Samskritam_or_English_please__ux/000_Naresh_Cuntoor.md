Just a quick reminder about our list policy. Messages should be in Samskritam or English or a mix of the two.  
Samskritam may be written in Devanagari (using any unicode font) or in English transliteration.  
  
In recent months we have seen messages in various Indian languages - all (or most) have been rejected.  
  
If you have questions, write to me off the list. No discussions on this on the list, please.
