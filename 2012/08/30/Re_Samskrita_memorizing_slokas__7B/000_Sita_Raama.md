Namaste Sai

For Gita there is a very good beginners book by gitapress gorakhpur -

**Sadhaka Sanjivani** its a good start for gita.

This online dictionary is another good tool<http://spokensanskrit.de/>

  

If you want to memorize then, I suggest you take up few verses (best is one at a time if you think thats too little then take up two or three.) at a time for memorization, get some audio and listen to audio once and repeat twice loud and clear it after. Do not listen to entire suprabhatam or gita chapter in one shot.

  

I hope this helps

Raama
