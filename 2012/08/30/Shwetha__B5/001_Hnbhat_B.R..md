I don't know the idea of the question. There would so many स्तोत्र-s if the adjective श्वेत is needed. But looking for the adjective word श्वेत doesn't mean anything.

  

Anyhow you can search on Google with Search with Unicode fonts. In vast Sanskrit Literature, there may be so many usages of this adjective in different cases.
