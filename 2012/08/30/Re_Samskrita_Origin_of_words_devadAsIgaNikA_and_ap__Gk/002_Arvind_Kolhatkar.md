I think a distinction has to be drawn between aदेवदासी and a गणिका.

  

'देवदासी' is explained by Monier-Williams in his book 'Brahmanism and Hinduism' on p. 451 thus: 

  

"There can ne no doubt that dancing in the East was once exclusively connected with religious devotion, especially with homage paid to Shiva in his character of Lord of Dancing. Further it is well-known that in ancient times women were dedicated to the service of the temples, like the Vestral virgins of Europe. They were held to be married to the god, and had no other duty but to dance fefore his shrine. Hence they were called god's slaves (deva-dasi) and were generally patterns of piety and propriety. In the present day they are still called by the same name, but are rather slaves to the licentious passions of the profligate Brahmans of the temples to which they belong."

  

I think it would be not be incorrect to add 'the locally influential persons' to the 'profligates' in this description.

  

Theगणिका, on the other hand, has no religious connotation or duties and is not confined to temples. The portrayal of गणिकाin literary works likeमृच्छकटिक of शूद्रकand कुट्टनीमत ofदामोदरगुप्त show the गणिकाas a woman of accomplishments. It was considered rather the 'done' thing for young men of wealth andleisure to be acquainted with the town
गणिका.   
  
Kalidasa mentions the गणिका(पण्यस्त्री) of Vidisha in the following verse, in which he describes the nearby low hill calledनीचैः as under:

  

नीचैराख्यं गिरिमधिवसेस्तत्र विश्रामहेतोः।  

त्वत्संपर्कात्पुलकितमिव प्रौढपुष्पै: कदम्बै॥

य: पण्यस्त्रीरतिपरिमलोद्गारिभिर्नागराणाम्।

उद्दामानि प्रथयति शिलावेश्मभिर्यौवनानि॥

  

Theगणिका or 'courtesan' of Sanskrit literature is thus closer to the 'demi-monde' women of decadent France or geishas of Japan.
