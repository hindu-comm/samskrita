Better to collect some information to support your imagination.

  

स्त्रियां बहुष्वप्सरसः स्वर्व्वेश्या उर्व्वशीमुखाः ।। ३६०.१० । is according to अमरः in the 5th century recorded the words अप्सरस् denoting the वेश्या-s of celestial region.

  

You can refer to वात्स्यायन-s कामशास्त्र on the chapter of पारदारिक which deals with going byes. Of course it is not meant for being followed as a शास्त्र to be able to protect their wives from adulteration.

  

And for the देवदासी is a custom prevalent in certain regions and traditionally accredited to some episode they believe. That depends on the history of the custom and the prevalent meaning in their region and has nothing to do with the etymology of these words if u are looking for dictionary meaning.

  

The club dancers working as dancers may or may not work as sexual workers (the women liberation usage of the word) than your age worn prostitute or some what recent call girls, which all mean almost the same. In the same way, it is the customary that some girl is dedicated to serve the god in a temple as देवदासी,which is not necessarily a Sankrit word, for its usage and you can follow after the customary meaning for detailed study of the said custom. It may a practical need of the dancer, without enough money as remuneration, or to satisfy the youths of the society as sexual workers earning members of the society, which is a different topic beyond the scope of this Sanskrit forum.
