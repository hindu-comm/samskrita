I think there is no body in the bench or the commission who could diferenciate between Sanskrit and Hindi as such, as the lawyers' their concern was to win the case and it is done.

  

"Setting aside the order, the State

commission allowed his appeal and awarded him a compensation of around US$275 for

mental agony, harassment, financial loss and litigation costs."

  

with the remark:

  

"if there was difficulty for the official to decipher the

meaning of 'Panch Sahastra Matra' he could have got it clarified from a person having

adequate knowledge of the language."

  

That makes the knowledge of Sanskrit or Hindi should be compulsory for the bank employees or somebody with the knowledge should be readily made available.\\

  

It is not based on the correctness or incorrectness of the language and moreover, we have only Roman transliteration on the wordings, in the report and not the exact transliteration what Panigrahi had written. If he had written the mixed language of Sanskrit and Hindi,

  

पंच-सहस्र-मात्र it would be only Hindi, Five Thousand only the very verbatim translation of English wording, provided the remaining Rupees is already there in English/Hindi.

  

Hence I don't think it has anything to to suggest that Cheques can be written in Sanskrit language as such in the report as only emphasis is on imposing Sanskrit to be accepted as a banking languag as mentioned in the first paragraph.

  

As you have remarked, Sanskrit and English languages could not be combined in one sentence, as in general,

  

रुपये/Rupees will be there in English and Hindi, and it can be filled in Hindi, to make the complete sentence to make it a valid Pay order. Only putting in Sanskrit words would not make Sanskrit writing, as in the above case. I don't know how he used it since 1980 saying himself it as Sanskrit language, which raised the issue.

  

As it appears, it is not the question of Sanskrit language, but the refusal of the check which was passed for 33 years according to him.

  

Only Signature makes the difference in language, in the nominative and the Bank has to tally it with the scanned signature in its records. The rest is for litigation sake.
