Raama,

  

There cannot be an answer to a question as to whether this or that version of a popular shloka is correct. The above verseसन्तोषः परमो लाभः सत्सङ्गः परमा गतिः ।विचारः परमं ज्ञानं क्षमो हि परमं सुखम् ॥, if rewritten asसन्तोषः परमो लाभः सत्सङ्गः परमा गतिः ।

विचारः परमं ज्ञानं क्षमाहि परमं सुखम् ॥ would be as 'correct' (i.e.authentic) as the first-quoted verseसन्तोषः परमो लाभः सत्सङ्गः परमा गतिः ।विचारः परमं ज्ञानं शमो हि परमं सुखम् ॥

  

The reason why I say so is that there are hundreds of examples of Sanskrit subhaaShitas that have more than one version each, every version being as meaningful as the next one. These areपाठभेदs and can be caused by several reasons. Works were reproduced by manual copying.
Sometimes the original was illegible or damaged and the copyist was forced to 'imagine' what the original would be. On occasions, the copyist felt that he could 'improve' upon a thought in a better manner by using a different word or construction. (Somewhat like an actor substituting his own words for what is in the writer's own copy.) Once aपाठभेद came into being by such reasons, it would be further copied and amultitudeofपाठभेदs would come into being, all equally meaningful, and, after a few years all indications ofपौर्वापर्य between them would lost.
