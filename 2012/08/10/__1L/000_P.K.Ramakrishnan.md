The planet Mars.



News item dated 10^(th) August 2012.



Mars crater where rover landed looks “earth like”.



In this connection I wish to bring to the notice of

readers that there are many words in Sanskrit for

the planet Mars like Kujah, Bhaumah, etc meaning

the son of earth.



Ku = earth

jah = born of



Bhumi = earth

Bhaumah = the son of Bhumi.
