Namo Rāghavāya  
  
I am pleased to inform you about the publication of Śrīraghunāthaśatakam, a Stotrakāvya in praise of Lord Śrīraghunātha, the presiding deity of the Raghunātha Mandira at Kullu (Himachal Pradesh), composed by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya.  
  
***About Raghunātha Mandira, Kullu  
***  
The temple was constructed in the 17th century by Raja Jagat Singh (also known as Dhruva), the ruler of Kullu. The traditional account about the construction of the temple goes thus. The king was misinformed that a Brāhmaṇa amongst his subjects had an invaluable jewel called Pākhā Motī. The king asked the Brāhmaṇa for the Pākhā Motī; the Brāhmaṇa told him he did not have it. The king threatened the Brāhmaṇa again and again. The Brāhmaṇa, sensing imminent death, locked himself with his family in his house and set fire to it from within. Then he performed a Havana on the terrace in which he cut off and offered his limbs to the fire, saying "O King, behold, this is your Pākhā Motī". The Brāhmaṇa died with his family. Afflicted by the sin of Brahmahatyā, the king contracted leprosy and started seeing worms everywhere. He went to the Ūrdhvaretā saint Śrīviṣṇudāsa Phalāhārī of the Rāmānanda order in the Himālayas. Śrīviṣṇudāsa Phalāhārī allayed his hallucinations and advised the king to get the gold Vigraha of Sītā and Rāma from the Cetānātha Mandira in Ayodhyā in order to get rid of leprosy. The king's courtiers and Rājapurohita brought the Vigraha from Ayodhyā and installed it in Kullu. The king was then cured of leprosy. The same Vigraha of Sītā and Rāma is housed in the Raghunātha Mandira of Kullu.  
  
***About Śrīraghunāthaśatakam  
***  
Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya was in Kullu in the year 2010. After performing Darśana of the Vigraha of Sītā and Rāma, the Guru delivered a nine-day Kathā on the meaning of the name "Raghunātha". During the nine days, he composed the Śrīraghunāthaśatakam, extoling the Nāma, Rūpa, Līlā, Dhāma, Svabhāva and Prabhāva of Lord Śrīraghunātha. The work consists of 108 verses in 12 meteres. There are 9 verses each in the Śārdūlavikrīḍita, Vaṃśastha, Vasantatilakā, Vaitālika, Śikhariṇī, Puṣpitāgrā, Upendravajrā, Indravajrā, Upajāti, Indravaṃśā, Drutavilambita and Rathoddhatā metres. Every verse of the work contains the word Raghunātha, mostly in the fourth quarter of the verse. There is rhyme in many verses, triple Yamaka in three verses (95 to 97), and Mahāyamaka in two verses (98 and 99).  
  
The work was published by the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped Univeristy (JRHU) in 2011, along with a Hindi meaning by the poet himself. The Samskrita original is attached in the email. The book with the Hindi meaning is priced very reasonably at INR 20.00 only (USD 35 cents). Proceeds from the sale of the book go towards the education of disabled students at JRHU.
