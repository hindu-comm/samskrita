Dear Group,

  

May I request experts on grammar to explain the following.  

  

The adjective 'शालेय' pertaining to school, is a word very commonly used in MarathI, as, for example, in 'शालेय अभ्यासक्रम'. I would like to know whether the word thus used is a properly constituted Sanskrit word.
If not, it would mean that its use in Marathi is supported only by convention orरूढि.

  

Monier Williams and Apte give the meaning of 'शालेय'as 'sown with rice' and 'a field of rice' from 'शालि' rice. Monier Williams explains 'शालीय' as 'belonging to a house'.

  

Are there other similar adjectives from other nouns? If so, what is the rule for their formation?
