शाला for meaning simply may mean school building, in general or any hall, for that specifically. Parallel to English school, it is used in Indian Languages, and not in accordance to Sanskrit usage. Hence the word itself is a coined one parallel to school and could not be found in any Sanskrit English Dictionary. There are many other adjectives, formed from different nouns following different rules as the case may be, which is too extensive to brief up here. There are extending fromतद्धिताः(॥ ४।१।७६) up to the end 5th Chapter complete in 3+4 - 7 पाद-s. In general, they are called by the name तद्धित suffixes, affixed to the nouns, individually or to the genre or group specified in the relevant rules and particularly in various range of meaning.

  

As for the present word शाला it can be anything related to शाला. Instead of rules, some variety of ranges, can be exemplified:

  

दशरथस्य अपत्यं पुमान् - दाशरथिः। - श्रीरामः\\

गङगायाः अपत्यं पुमान् - गाङ्गेयः - भीष्मः.

पथि साधु - पाथेयम् -provender or provisions&cfor a journey, anything carried to be used on the way. - pathin.

  

कपेः भावः - कापेयम्- the acts of monkey, कापेयचेष्टा।

  

कापिशायनम् - a wine, but not related to कपि and शयन, but derived from कपिशा \> कापिशी \> , a flower used to prepare a kind of liquor. Again, कापिशायनी - द्राक्षा, grape used for wine द्राक्षासव.

4-2-99 कापिश्याः ष्फक्.

  

पुरोहितस्य कर्म - पौरोहित्यम्। clear in meaning as the popular words.

  

अधिपतेः कर्म - आधिपत्य - the administration, domination.

  

Too wide in range, to contain in this limited space of message. For sample, some are given above.
