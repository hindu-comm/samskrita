Dear Group members,

  

I heard of a saying in Sanskrit that translates to "one who was not a rishi in their previous life cannot be a poet in this one, one who was not a gandharva in a previous life cannot be beautiful in this one and one who does not have the amsa of Vishnu in them cannot be an administrator". Would any of you know the original Sanskrit version?
Thanks.
