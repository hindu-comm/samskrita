I have come across two readings of this verse handed down by tradition  
  
राम रामेति रामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे ।  
सहस्रनामतत्तुल्यं रामनाम वरानने ॥  
  
This is the popular reading which is found in Gita Press and many other editions.  
  
The alternate reading is  
  
राम रामेति रामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे ।  
सहस्रनाम**ता**तुल्यं रामनाम वरानने ॥  
  
Some friends of mine from Southern states recite the first foot as "श्रीराम राम रामेति"."राम राम रामेति" as you have written is only seven syllables and is one syllable too short. I have not come across the reading सहस्रनामतस्तुल्यं - I wonder what is the ablative case for here.  
  
Sh. Bhat has given the translation already. both मनोरमे and वरानने can apply to both Parvati as the vocative case (the listener of the verse) and to the name of Rama, as adjectives to रामे. वरं आननं येन तद्वराननं रामनाम इत्यर्थः तस्मिन् वरानने रामे (अहं) रमे.
