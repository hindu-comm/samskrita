The last shloka of Ramaraksha stotra is generally chanted as:



rAma rAma rAmeti rame rAme manorame \|

sahasranAma tattulyaM rAmanAma varAnane \|\|



There was posted at one site a 'correction' - 'sahasranAmatastulyaM' .



Is this a pAThabheda or true correction?



Also, what would be an accurate translation?



Thank you.



Regards,
