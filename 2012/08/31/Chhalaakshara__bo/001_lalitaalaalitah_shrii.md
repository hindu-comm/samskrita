This is a term associated with tantra-s.  
Better reveal more information, so that help could come to you.  
  
Anyway, it just means that these sUtra are not to be understood following simple rules of vyAkaraNa, etc. as the true meaning is hidden. The author has used cryptic language while creating sUtra-s.
