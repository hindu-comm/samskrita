Yes, Sir, Naresh Cuntoorji.

I presume Samskritam had been a language of masses, even though they were illiterate as now also many are illiterate i.e., they can't read or write but they can nicely converse in the local languages of the areas.
 Kindly throw some light on the topic of my first mail.

Regards,

D.Ramakrishnan.
