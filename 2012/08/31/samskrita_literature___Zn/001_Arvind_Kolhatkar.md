While disclaiming to be a पण्डितवरिष्ठ, let me say the following about the presumption in the original post, contained in the phrase'कदासंस्कृतस्यह्रासःआरम्भःजातः'.

  

For Sanskrit to be in the declining mode now, one has to presume that at some time in the past it was in the ascending mode. It is true that prior to the Islamic and later-day British rulers, Sanskrit was the exclusive language in use by the elite - political. literary and scholarly. If you felt you belonged to this elite group or desired to belong to this group, you had to communicate with other elites through Sanskrit. or else you could not be counted among the elites. After India ceased to be exclusively 'Hindu', other languages joined Sanskrit in the category of the languages of the elites, the last such example - that still continues to be with us - being English.

  

That said, it is also to be remembered by Sanskrit never was the language of the masses, just as English (in India) today is not. As a matter of fact learning Sanskrit was actually forbidden to women and persons of the lower strata. That is why Mahavira and Buddha preached to the masses in non-Sankrit languages and Ashoka wrote his inscriptions, meant to be read by the masses, in non-Sanskrit languages.

  

Therefore I do not subscribe to the view that Sanskrit was ever in 'ascendance' and do not agree with the proposition
संस्कृतस्यह्रासःआरम्भःजातः.
