Aaryaah, svasti/

Samskrita was spoken languageand there is no iota of doubt. But it is not correctto object foreigners for decline of its status in our education system.

 Even muslim rulers encouraged Samskrita scholars. Muslims were already rulingsome parts of ourcountry when Navinanyaya started .They did not try to preventspreading of Navinanyaya.Some poets were actually patronised by Muslim rulers.

 Europeans showed usprinting and publishing. Everybodyknowsabouteditions of forforeigner scholars.

Even though we can not praise them for every statement they made about our country and Samskrta works, we can not put their works aside in toto.We can not forget scholars like Maxmuller, Buhler, Whitney, Peter Peterson, Louis Rice, Kittel,Bloomfield,Monier Williams, Burgess... the list is very long.We may critisize them for their Euro-centred / bible-centred narrow views but one can not deny the fact that they published so many works with good introductions and indices. Before their taking Samskrta studies, history of our literature was in some fables and stories.

 Even today, we can not neglect the works of the scholars like George Cardona.

क्रीस्तोरन‍न्तरम्प्रतिशताब्दौकतिग्रन्थाःसंस्कृतभाषायांरचिताःसर्वैःपण्डितैःभारतदेशेविविधेषुप्रान्तेषु ?

 Nobody can tell exactly how many Samskrta books were produced in BC and AD.Our country has produced thousands of good Samskrta literature in every century.

The reason for gradual diclining of Samskrta in our education system(NOT IN OUR COUNTRY) is:-

 Raising of schools and colleges of modern education in whichthe scope to learn traditional shastras is very limited.

 Increasingnumber of books inthe languages other than Samskrta.

 Amplifying of publishers ofbooks in the languages other than Samskrita. Compared to this,the publishers of Samskrta literature are almost nil.(Please note: I am talking about Samskrta literature and not about the works ***on* *Samskrta*** written in the langauges other than Samskrta.)

 Samskrta scholars' hesitating attitudein writing on the subjects other than traditionalshastras.

But, there is no occasion for lament. Even today there arethousands of Samskrta writers who have studied shastras in hundreds of Pathashalas. Vakyaarthasabhaas are common in some Mathas and Gurukulas.(Please refer Sixty years of Sanskrit Studies vol-1 [pub.by](http://pub.by) Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan for more details).

 For creatingawarenessof existence of Samskrta in modern days-

 \*Central Governmentshall be pressurizedto make a policy to supply modern Samskrta works to thel publilc libraries.  
 \*We shall not neglect modern Samskrta literature. We have to purchase them, read them and interact with the authors.

 \*There shall be seminars on modern Samskrta literature.

Needless to say, book exhibitions of modern Samskrita works shall be necessary part of these seminars.
