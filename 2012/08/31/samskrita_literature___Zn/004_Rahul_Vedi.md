also consider the works of adi shankaraachaarya - almost all the available works by him is written in samskrit.

  

his commentaries and poems and hymns etc, all are written in samskrit.

he wrote these during the peak time if jain and buddhism sects

  

and he created these texts for the people of that time and also for the society of the future.

  

just my 2cents worth
