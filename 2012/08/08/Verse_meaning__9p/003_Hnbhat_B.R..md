Here is the reply to the verse:

  

<http://www.scribd.com/doc/68257944/On-Getting-Moksha-Four-Shiva-kshetras-and-Carnatic-Music-stalwarts>

  

and also here is another one discussing the same verse:

  

<http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/tw/tw473.html>

  

ascribed to the talks of Ramanamaharshi, related to Arunachaleshvara.

  

Five bhuta=linga-s are popularly known, of which only four are listed in the verse. Anyhow the second deals with the deeper meaning intended by the verse.

  

काशी and अरुणाचल are popular, as वाराणसी and अरुणाचल - तिरुवण्णामलै. अभ्रसद्स् is known otherwise चिदम्बरसभा also, in Tamil simply चिदम्बरम्. The forms सदसि or सदसः does not make much difference, but grammatically सदसः becomes fit. For the others the case ending is common. The remaining is कमलालय as we can see from the two links and according to Subrahmania, it is another name for Thiruvavuur, the popular birth place of Tyagaraja, famous for its Aradhana festival.

  

The one left out from the list of five, is काळहस्तीश्वर temple, totally making पञ्चभूतक्षेत्र-s referred to in one of the कृति-s by Muthusvami Dikshitar. And, the other अभ्रसदस् is shifted to एकाम्बरेश्वर in Kanchivaram.

  

What I could not follow is how कमलालय refers to thiruvayur. It can be referring to Thamaraikulam also in Kanyakumari dist. North Thamaraikulam is dedicated to Shiva and South Thamaraikulam is dedicated to Devi. which is directly translated to Sanskrit would give the exact name कमलालय as in the verse. The omission of the fifth one of the Pancabhuta-s, in the quoted verse makes the four temples in the verse also referring to Shiva, but only it glorifies अरुणाचलेश्वर makes this guess also possible. It is ascribed to Purana. May be some "sthalapurana" of Arunachala.

  

  

Hope this throws some light on it.
