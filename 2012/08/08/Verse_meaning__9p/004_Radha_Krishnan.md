Dear Sri Arvind ji,  
abhra = rain-clouds (as opposed to megha = clouds without water)  
saras = a place where water is kept (for example, tank, lake etc)  
abhra-saras = a place where water/rain-clouds stay = sky =  
aakaasha-tattva=Chidambaram

The meaning of the verse therefore is:  
By seeing Chidambaram, one gets mukti.

Hope this helps,  
RK.
