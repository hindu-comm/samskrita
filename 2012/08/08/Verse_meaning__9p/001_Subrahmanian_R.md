Namaste,



I do not understand the place referred to in the first Pada. A person gets liberation on having a darsan of -- , or by being born in Tiruvarur, or by his last days in Kasi/ Varanasi or by merely thinking of Arunachaeswar the presiding deity of Tiruvannamalai.



With reverence to the scholars
