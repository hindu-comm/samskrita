दर्शनादभ्रसादसि जननात्कमलालये ॥

काश्यन्तु मरणान्मु्क्तिः स्मरणादरुणाचले ॥

  

if one seeing the chithsaba Natarajar in chidhambaram, will get libration. (dharshanath dhabra saras or dharsanath dhabra saba)

  

if one borns at kamalalaya i.e. in thiruvaroor, will gets libration (mukthi)

  

if one dead in kaasi or varanasi, will get mukthi.

  

if one just think the holy town thiruvannamalai at tamilnadu, will get mukthi.

  

apart from the above sloka, some more temple are related for mukthi kshethram. for eg. if one walks at madurai, will get mukthi. (because lord shiva plays 64 thiruvilaiyadal (giving bless) at madurai.

&

if one lives at kaandhipuram, will get mukthi.

  

above sloka represent, the easiest way to get mukthi i.e. one can get mukthi when he think about thiruvannamalai. because it is very difficult, one could born at thiruvarur, one could dead at kaasi, one can have dharshan of chidhambaram. But every one can easily think about thiruvannamalai.
