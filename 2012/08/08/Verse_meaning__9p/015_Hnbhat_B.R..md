Even if it can be derived from Sanskrit or Prakrit word, in the verse, three syllables are needed - either सदसः or सरसः, and सरं or सरम् would not fill in the verse. And for meaning also they will give different things in Sanskrit, and also the meaning given by you is not one of those in Sanskrit. It is not only a question of etymology or derivation, but metrical requirement also that counts in the verse.
