Thanks for the explanation of अभ्रसरस्.

  

I have not heard of the differentiation between अभ्र and मेघ both given as synonyms in most of the kosha-s.

"अभ्रं मेघो वारिवाहः" which can mean अभ्र is the मेघ carrying the water. By contrast you must have deduced मेघ is without water. But commentators are silent on this point.

  

and "स्तनयित्नुर्बलाहकः" बलाहक would the one thundering cloud in the same token.

  

Etymologically, न भ्रश्यन्ति आपः यस्मात् - इति पौराणिकाः।

अपो बिभर्ति इति अभ्रम्। But the कनकसभा is also popular. Anyhow with the reading सरस्, it would mean the sky, the storage of clouds. metaphorically, the sky.

  

and मेघ means raining cloud etymologically, derived from the verb मिह सेचने, to shower, rain. In either case, it doesn't change the metaphorical meaning of सरस्.

  

अभ्रसदस् - can also mean चिदम्बरसभा = कनकसभा;

  

"अभ्रं मेघे च गगने धातुभेदे च काञ्चने।"

  

also it directly means the sky also as per the above line quoted in the commentary, without the necessity of the periphrastic interpretation of the reading अभ्रसरस् to mean sky. चिदम्बर is the metaphysical appellation of the deity.

  

It could also directly refer to the कनकसभा = अभ्रसभा, as अभ्र can mean कनक or gold, from the above cited line.

  

Hope this clarifies both the readings. As noticed by another member, the source for the verse is to be found in Skandapurana.

  

Anyhow, there is question of correctness between the two readings, as Aravindji had already remarked in one of his postings. Both have the same meaning, referring to चिदम्बर temple location or the installed नटराज in the कनकसभा, or अभ्रसदस्. चिदम्बरम् is the pure crystal शिवलिङ्ग there and नटराज is installed in the auditorium in front, probably referred to as कनकसभा in the क्रुति-s by Carnatic saints.
