Namaste.



Among the most infomative words of Bhattji, I beg to differ in one small respect.

The 'Thyagaraja' and Thiruvarur \[Kamalalayam\] is different from Saint Thiagaraja the composer of Thiruvaiyaru. Lord Thyagaraja is said to have performed Ajapa natanam at Thiruvarur, famous among other things, for the chariot. Thiruvaiyaru is the place of Saint Thiagaraja who authored numerous immortal 'keertanas' and lived about 200 years ago.



With Respects
