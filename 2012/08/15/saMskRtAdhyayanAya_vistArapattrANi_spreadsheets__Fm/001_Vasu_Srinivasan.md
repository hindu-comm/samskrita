one observation: in prAtipadikam koshaH spreadsheet, for everyword there is a gaNaH, upagaNaH, upopagaNaH, which represents a hierarchical classifiacation. Even though such a scheme is good, this may not work well with huge data: maintaining or properly classifying it will be difficult, leading to mistakes. A simpler approach would be just to #tag them, instead of any hierarchical classification. This will allow a prAtipadikam to be tagged or cross-tagged with several attributes (not just a few) without restrictions. For eg vajra could be tagged as shilA, aayudhaH or aabharaNaH.
