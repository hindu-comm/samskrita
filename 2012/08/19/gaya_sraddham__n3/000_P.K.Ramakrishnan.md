I have heard the following two lines of a sloka in  

connection with performing Sraddham at Gaya.

  

एष्टव्या बहव: पुत्रा:

यद्येकोपि गयां व्रजेत् /

One should desire many children

so that at least one of them will go to Gaya

(and perform Gaya Sraddham).

  

Can some one provide the full sloka and

mention the source of the same (either

Ramayana or Mahabharata)
