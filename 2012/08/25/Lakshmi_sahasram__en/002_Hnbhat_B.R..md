The link provided by Mr. Sunder seems to be containing only selected verses. I have not checked.

But the commentary in English is good. Thanks for the same.

  

Here is the link to the complete Text of Lakshmisahasram with Sanskrit Balabodhini Commentary of Srinivasa Pandita.

Though I had it downloaded by DLI and uploaded in GDrive, I could not access it for some unknown reason. Hence the delay. There seems to be some others, but not complete. Probably the one is in Telugu script and others in parts. Only one part is available or some other. A different commentary. But DLI d/l gives the trouble now a days.

  

With regards
