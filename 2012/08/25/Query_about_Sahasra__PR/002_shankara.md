Bhat Sir,

  
I could not find required information in both the sites. My query is whether a word which is used along with sahasra should be in singular or plural?  
  
To say "thousands of horses" should I say "अश्वाणां सहस्राणि"? Is it okay to say "अश्वस्य सहस्रं" as in नमसः सहस्रम्. I had this doubt after seeing the difference in usage in the 2 instances quoted in my first mail - सहस्रेण शिरसाम् (in Saundaryalahari 2) and नमसः सहस्रमखिलम् ([Mantra Matrika Pushpamala Stava](http://prramamurthy1931.blogspot.in/2011/04/hymns-to-srimata-srimantramatruka.html) Sloka 16).  



regards  
shankara
