Namaste!  
  
'Sahasra' is used along with plural as well as singular forms of words as in सहस्रेण शिरसाम् (in Saundaryalahari 2) and नमसः सहस्रमखिलम् ([Mantra Matrika Pushpamala Stava](http://prramamurthy1931.blogspot.in/2011/04/hymns-to-srimata-srimantramatruka.html) Sloka 16).  
Is नमसः सहस्रम् a rare usage? Would it be alright to use नमसां सहस्रम्? I request learned members of this group to clear my doubt.
