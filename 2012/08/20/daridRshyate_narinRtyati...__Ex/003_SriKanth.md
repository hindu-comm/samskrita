Another question, I came across the word पप्रथमम् in many places -  
such as this usage.

सर्वेभ्य: पप्रथमम् नवरात्री पर्वस्य शुभाशया: \|

I think this is stressing the first element... Tamil also has similar  
word like "Mudhal mudhalil"...

Are there similar words? for the last element etc...?

Thanks  
Srikanth.
