I could not find this word in any of the Sanskrit dictionaries. But it can be produced by adding the prefix प्र+प्रथमः - प्ररथमं - as adverb conveying the idea "first of all". As a noun it can be used as सर्वनाम also in masculine plural in the nominative as प्रथमाः, प्रथमे।

  

I don't see the necessity of wishing first of all the greetings which is purely a translation or mixture of spoken English/regional languages together, in the above context. Navaratri festival comes once and for all, at the same time, whether it differ with the पञ्चाङ्ग calculation followed regionally. It is not seen in classical Sanskrit Language. Instead, the common phrase to express the idea is

  

इदंप्रथमम्, इदंप्रथमतया, ऐदम्पर्येण, etc. are available.

  

And also the usage of the form seems to be archaic. as we know the word is पर्वन् - which is used in the following meanings:
