Namaste

  

I am pleased to inform you all that theJagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University(JRHU) is coming up with a triple commentary (Vṛttitraya) on the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The three commentaries are being composed by the lifelong Chancellor of the university,Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya. The commentaries are:

1.  **Rāghavatoṣiṇī** - This is a commentary in Samskrita verses
    (Padya). It is named in honour of Śrīrāma, the Iṣṭadeva of the
    commentator. 2.  **Rāmabhadrīyā** - This is a commentary in Samskrita prose (Gadya).
    It is named after the commentator. This commentary will be almost
    same as the DLitt thesis of the commentator,*Aṣṭādhyāyyāḥ
    Pratisūtraṃ Śābdabodhasamīkṣaṇam* (1997), for which he was awarded
    the*Vachaspati* degree by theSampūrṇānanda Saṃskṛta
    Viśvavidyālaya, Vārāṇasī. This commentary is already used in several
    colleges and universities for teaching grammar. 3.  **Rāmaprasādinī** - This is a commentary in Hindi prose (Gadya). It
    is named after the Vyākaraṇa Guru of the commentator, the late
    Paṇḍita Rāmaprasāda Tripāṭhī of Vārāṇasī. Paṇḍita Rāmaprasāda
    Tripāṭhīis often referred to as *Abhinavapāṇini* for his grasp on
    Samskrita grammar.

The work will run into around 5,100 full-size pages and will be published in eight volumes. It will contain around 20,000 verses. The commentator has finished composing around 3,000 pages and the work is expected to be published next year by JRHU.

  

The proofreading of the work will be a monumental task as it will besteeped in Samskrita grammar. JRHU is looking out for Vaiyyākaraṇas who are willing to proofread the work. The university will pay the market rate for proofreading. The proofreader should be either inVaranasi (where the book will be typeset and printed) or (s)he should be willing to spend time in Chitrakoot (where the university and composer are based) with the commentator for proofreading.

  

InterestedVaiyyākaraṇasare requested to get in touch with me over email. I also request members to forward this email to otherVaiyyākaraṇas who may be interested in taking up this work.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
