It is a question of emotional response. If I say, Sanskrit has ceased to be a spoken language and the accent and other euphony system of a language were restored by Panini, and after Panini, it was taken as prescriptive Grammar than descriptive one as I had learned, I will be alleged of following Maxmuller and others for that.

  

If I say, practically, how many people speak Sanskrit as a spoken language, (not as a language that could be spoken after learning grammar, which can be done by any one and for any language) for daily needs as one learns to speak in childhood, I am not sure what will be precise number. If anybody can reply in precise form, it is welcome. In this sense it was called Sanskrit was not a Spoken language and not that it could not be spoken at all learning it with effort. When one learns his mother tongue, i.e. he learns by hearing to the language spoken by his parents and it is his spoken language for life at least in his region, it holds good.

  

Now the question about वाक्य is grammatically derived on the structure of the sentece, एकतिङ् वाक्यम्, etc. in many different ways and it does not require it to be spoken or written. In either case, it is a वाक्य, whether written in metrical structure or recited orally, it is only श्लोकवाक्य. It doesn't make any difference in written or spoken language or वाक्य in its extended sense.

  

  

Depends on the necessity of the learner or user of the language only and it is this विवक्षा which makes it clear वक्तुमिच्छा - one who speaks, i.e. the speaker. Like in spoken language, intonation causes the clarity of meaning and pause also helps. But fluent speech also will have this facility in spoken language.

  

This is my understanding of the last part of the कारिका,
