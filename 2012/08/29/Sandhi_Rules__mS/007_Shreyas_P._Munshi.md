Respected Prof Nityanand Misra Sir,  
What you have stated is highly demoralising for me! I was all the time under the impression that a book by none less than Prof R G Bhandarkar (In whose honour stands the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune)would be the ultimate book for a learner to go by.  
  
What you have stated is perhaps at a very high level but that leaves a learner like me clueless. Which would be the ideal book to go by?  
  
Another question that arises in my mind is about the use of conjunction 'cha'.  
  
We were taught that at the end of a sequence, while intermediary 'cha' is optional, the 'cha' at the end of a sequence is mandatory. Not following that resulted in our losing marks.  
  
And I find that in the famous prayerful verse taught to all children 'tvameva mAtA pitA tvameva, tvameva bandhushcha sakhA tvemeva', there is no 'cha' after 'pitA' and 'sakhA'. Why is it so? If it is poetic liberty, I have not found such liberties taken by Veda VyAsa or in many many subhAshita-s(or maybe with my inapt reading, I have not noticed them; would love to be cited) in ShrimadBhagvadGeetA!  
  
"upAgataH sthitaH asmi aham"!!Kindly help.  
  
Regards..Shreyas
