Highly obliged, respected Bhat Sir and Subhash Sir.  
  
I dug up my sixty year old sanskrit school book by Prof Bhandarkar. There, in one foot note, he says "In Sanskrit two vowels cannot come together without coalescing". He has not mentioned anything about consonants.  
  
I was looking for one more footnote which I think I had read while in school but could not locate it. As I remember, the footnote said (to the effect) that the sandhi rules are not prescriptive. In a normal flow of speech they automatically occur. I now realise that though there is space between words, in a fluent natural speech the spoken words are not separated as if spoken by a machine. And so what Bhat sir has said seems to be exactly the same.While learning and maybe teaching, the sandhi may be split but if the speech is fluent the sandh would have taken place in a natural way.  
Prof Bhat Sir, your reply has come as a big relief to me. So also Subhash Sir's contribution.

Aperson who taught us Sandhi, quoted the same shloka.  
  
And in the explanation of वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥  
we were told that "only in spoken sentence or shloka", the sandhi is optional.  
(reasoning being वाक्ये originates from root vaak - to speak)  
  
And ofcourse, when one writes the anvaya of a shloka, or separates the various padas, sandhi can be split.  
Is that a proper interpretation (regarding spoken) ?
