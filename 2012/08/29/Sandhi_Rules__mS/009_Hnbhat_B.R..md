Dear Munshi,

  

A Good Sanskrit Grammar complete in itself for beginners should contain both the rules and the exceptions, in any given topic. In Sandhi, only the special conjunct forms are explained for the beginners, generally, without giving their exceptions following strictly the "sandhi" rules under the scheme of Panini, which contain both rules and exceptions, without which it would be incomplete. This is the case with the sandhi splitting and joining programs also available profusely on the net and only the rules are fed, which consider only joining of letters is "sandhi" and without "sandhi" separated with space and do not consider these exceptions as "sandhi"s. And end up with wrong forms many times.

  

You are sticking to your own preliminary and basic grammar. No body can help, if one does not want to go to higher level, and want to know everything to come to his level, in learning. Even

# God helps those who help themselves

  

Please try to go to higher level of Grammar than ever stagnant in the primary level and listed among drop outs. Here is the Higher Level of Sanskrit Grammar written by Kale as the name itself suggests, it is not for beginners. In one link you can scroll over the sections you want through hyperlinks on the web page:

  

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/KALEScan/disp1/index1.php?sfx=png>

  

  

and here you can download the same in pdf format by clicking the link:

Please note that in the pdf, sometimes the visarga-s and anusvara-s might have been missing, due to clearing of scanned images. But in the above link, the rules are available covering all the sections of sandhi.

  

And for your question of the use of च, it is a much complicated issue grammatically used in 4 different shades and as a rule, it is never found beginning a sentence, though there is no rule prohibiting it. But it is common sense, that as a conjunct, it has to combine some thing word, verb or sentence preceding it. and its use at both ends is optional. Here is a scholarly discussion on the use of double conjuncts in another group:

Hope you will find many inspiring ideas in the discussion, though not strictly technical.

  

  

Hope this will be helpful.
