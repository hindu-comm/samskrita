I believe the answer depends upon how much of a 'purist' you wish to become. If one wants an 'easy' or 'fun' approach, which, to our consternation, is increasinglybecoming the guiding principled in today's educational system, one may get away by learning Sanskrit minus the sandhis. if one wants to learn and use Sanskrit as it was used in its heyday, it has to be with sandhi. I, for one, prefer the latter.

  

I may also point out that all old literature becomes meaningless and all poetry unrecitable, if sandhis are done away with.
