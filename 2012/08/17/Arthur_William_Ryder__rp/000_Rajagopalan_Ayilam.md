Dear All,  
  
I found a few lovely verses in an anthology named Relative by Arthur Willam Ryder. He has given the english translation but not the original verse, and reference is also a little vague. Could anyone help me to find the original verse in Devanagari.  
  
  
The following are the verses:  
  
I see a dog, but not a stone  
I find a stone, the dog is flown,  
If dog and stone at once I view  
The kings dog. Damn ! What can I do (from some anthology)  
  
  
A begger in in the graveyard cried,  
Awake my friend, be satisfied  
to live again and bear the weight of poverty  
for of late I have grown weary, my heart is  
led to crave the comfort of the dead.  
The corpse was silent, he was sure,  
It was better to be dead than be a poor.  
(from Bharthruhari collections)  
  
  
  
A scholar who can merely quote  
Unmastered learning got by rote,  
Is erudition s luckless dupe,  
A spoon to ladle wisdom s soup.  
The fool who hears but cannot prize  
The wisdom of the truly wise,  
He too is erudition s dupe,  
A spoon to ladle wisdom s soup.  
But you, dear reader, if you prize  
This wisdom of the truly wise,  
Will soon be added to the group  
Of tongues that relish wisdom s soup. (From Mahabharata)  
  
  
Thanks in advance
