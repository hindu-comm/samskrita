"A begger in in the graveyard cried,  
Awake my friend, be satisfied  
to live again and bear the weight of poverty  
for of late I have grown weary, my heart is  
led to crave the comfort of the dead.  
The corpse was silent, he was sure,  
It was better to be dead than be a poor."

  

उत्तिष्ठ क्षणमेकमुद्वह सखे दारिद्र्यभारं मम

श्रान्तस्तावदहं चिरान्मरणजं सेवे त्वदीयं सुखम्।

इत्युक्तं धनवर्जितस्य वचनं श्रुत्वा श्मशाने शवो

दारिद्र्यान्मरणं वरं वरमिति ज्ञात्वैव तूष्णीं स्थित:॥

  

This is believed to be from Panchatantra, though I am not sure of it.

  

'A scholar who can merely quote

Unmastered learning got by rote,  
Is erudition s luckless dupe,  

A spoon to ladle wisdom s soup.'

  

यस्य नास्ति निजा प्रज्ञा केवलं तु बहुश्रुतः।

न स जानाति शास्त्रार्थं दर्वी सूपरसानिव॥

  

This is believed to be from Hitopadesha, though again I am not sure of it.
