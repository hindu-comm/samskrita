Sorry for the curt reply.

  

Dhatupatha, Ganapatha, Unadipaatha ARE supplementary to Ashtadhyayi and compiled to be used with the rules and conforming to the rules in Ashtadhyayi. Dictionaries are prepared with the view of helping to be used with the Sanskrit Grammars and Readers compiled modern Grammar teachers like the Guide to Sanskrit Composition by Apte himself, and other Readers like  
First Book, Second Book of Sanskrit by Bhandarkar, Higher  
Sanskrit Grammar by MR Kale etc. So the objective of both the texts are different and accordingly they are compiled with different schemes.
