Hello all,

  

A friend and I have started a \~weekly announce mailing list on beautiful Sanskrit phrases, and thought that some of you may be interested. Since there is a lot of very good introductory material on Sanskrit already available, we'll be focusing on intermediate levels of difficulty and exploring from a purely literary point of view. I've appended the first posting to give you a flavor of what we have in mind.

Please note, this is an announce-only mailing list, meaning only the administrator will post; your feedback, of course, is most welcome - please write to myself [kvm....@gmail.com]() or to Shreevatsa, [shree...@gmail.com]()

  

Best regards,

Mohan

Hello, and welcome to the first edition of Sadāsvāda, an attempt at exploring the perennial pleasures of Sanskrit literature. We hope to look at one beautiful Sanskrit phrase every edition, with a morsel of information about its origin and context. While the futility of trying to drink an ocean by sampling drops here and there is not lost on us, we take some solace in the success of predecessors in this path, from Proust to Penzias. Without much further ado then, or as our Sanskrit plays would put it,अलम् अतिविस्तरेण (alam ativistareṇa), let us begin:

  

मही-तल-स्पर्शन-मात्र-भिन्नम्

(mahī-tala-sparśana-mātra-bhinnam)

  

MEANING:

> 
> > Literally, "earth-surface-touching-only-different", meaning "Different > only in that it is touching the Earth".
> > 

  

CONTEXT:

> 
> > This phrase is from Kalidasa's Raghuvamsha (Chapter 2, verse 50). In > this acclaimed masterpiece deriving from the Ramayana epic stream, > Kalidasa constructs stories for several of Rama's ancestors and > descendants; the greatest testimony to his genius is the fact that his > stories are so deeply entwined in Indian culture that most people are > not even aware of their origin!

> > In the first story, King Dileepa is childless, and goes to the sage > Vasistha for help. The sage asks him to care for Nandini, the holy > wish-giving cow of his ashrama. One day, when Dileepa is tending to > Nandini in the nearby foothills, a lion appears out of nowhere and > attacks her. Dileepa tries to fight, but finds himself paralyzed. The > lion smiles, and tells him that he is a servant of Shiva; that Dileepa > is paralyzed because of his magic powers; that Nandini violated a > sacred sanctuary, and that she shall be killed. The helpless Dileepa, > with utmost selflessness, begs the lion to let go of Nandini and kill > him instead; he cannot bear to let his protectee come to harm. The > lion laughs, and tells him that he is being foolish in wanting to give > himself up for the sake of a mere*animal*- if he lives, he can save > a*hundred thousand*cows! He concludes a strongly convincing > argument, saying: >
