Dear Group,

  

क्व कस्य कर्म संवीक्ष्य करोत्यन्योऽपि गर्हितम् \|  
गतानुगतिको लोको न लोकः पारमार्थिकः \|\|  
मित्रभेद ३७३.  

  

The above is a version known to me fromपंचतन्त्र. Recently another version came before me as under:

  

गतानुगतिको लोको न लोक: पारमार्थिक: ।

वालुकालिङ्गमात्रेण गतं मे ताम्रभाजनम् ॥

  

The story behind this second version is as under:

  

A Sadhu came to a river forप्रातर्विधि and buriedunder the sandthe only copper vessel he had to prevent it for being stolen. As a marker, he also placed aशिवलिंग of sand over the spot where it was buried.
When he was away, several people saw theशिवलिंग and, thinking it to be a holy spot, made their ownशिवलिंगs there. When the Sadhu returned, he saw these severalशिवलिंगs and could not tell which was his. He thus lost his copper vessel and recited the above verse.

  

Has anyone come across the second version? Where is it found?
