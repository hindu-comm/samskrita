Thanks for pointing it. I'll change it after a few days.  
The blog is at [blogger.com](http://blogger.com) and it creates permanent links for individual posts. That means I can't change the URL. I've to delete the old post and re-post it with correct perm-link.  
Doing so now will be useful only if I post new link again to all forums.  
So, I'll do it later.
