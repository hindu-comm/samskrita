Enable input tools - Use IMEs, transliteration, or virtual keyboards to type in the language of your choice - Learn more

  

And enabling it, you will be lead to the selection part. There are two icons below सं when you add one for IME and the other for keyboard display. You can add in the page by using the arrow marks and then scroll down the set up page to save the changes to the settings page.

  

Now when you open the inbox, you can see the सं icon by the side of the gear icon as I have already shown.

  

Hope this is clear. You can use the video also in his message.
