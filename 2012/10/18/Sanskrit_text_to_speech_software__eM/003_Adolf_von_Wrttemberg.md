Dear Fellow Sanskritists,

Tangential to this text-to-speech discussion is one source for other languages too. Working within German, French and Hindi I use the following vendor:

<http://www.nextup.com/>

Their website also has links for purchasing many other languages. I have used this vendor for Windows XP, Vista, Win7 and now Windows 8. Note that you have to purchase the different “voices”, e.g. male and/or female voices in Hindi and other languages from them and/or other links on their website. As an amusing comment, after having purchased female Indian voices to read both English & Hindi texts for me, I informed my wife, Rani: “No, I do not have a female visitor in my computer room.” \<g>

विष्णुः

P.S. I am very interested in obtaining text-to-speech for Sanskrit too.

Die Macht wandelt gerne auf krummen Beinen.

("Power likes to walk on crooked legs.")

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900)
