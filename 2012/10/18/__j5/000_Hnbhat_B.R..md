Dear friends,

  

Just I wanted to share a piece of devotional poetry  
  

  

अयं क्षीरांभोधेः पतिरिति गवां पालक इति

श्रितोऽस्माभिः क्षीरोपनयनधिया गोपतनयः।

अनेन प्रत्यूहो व्यरचि सततं येन जननी-

स्तनादप्यस्माकं सकृदपि पयो दुर्लभमभूत् ॥३.९५॥

  

We put our faith on this son of a cattleman thinking he is the Lord of the milky ocean and takes care of cows and hoping that we would have uninterrupted supply of milk. But he did the entirely opposite thing by which even our mothers’ milk became difficult to get (i.e. we were released from the cycle of births and deaths).

  

You can read rest of the poem श्रीकृष्णकर्मामृतम् - in this page.

and enjoy.
