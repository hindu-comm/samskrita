Dear Friends

I am trying to convert printed Roman Sanskrit from a book into a searchable document.

However scanning the pages and converting to Word looses all diacritical marks and these have to put in again manually.

Is there any type of scanner or software which will keep the diacritics intact and then can I do a 'search and find' for particularly words or phrases. Can anybody please help me solve this problem?
