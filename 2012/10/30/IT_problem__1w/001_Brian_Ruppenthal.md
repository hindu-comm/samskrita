Vimala, and anyone else interested,  

  

Others more familiar with either Sanskrit itself, or with scanning software, may send in more expert answers than I can. But just in case no one else does...

  

I faced this same problem. I noticed however that scanning software tends to make predictable errors when interpreting diacritics on specific letters. I therefore was able to scan the documents into Word and do global search-and-replace for the predicted errors. All it takes is making a catalog of the errors and the Roman-letter-plus-diacritics the errors match with. 

  

This worked well enough. It was still laborious process of course, but far quicker than retyping the text using ITRANS code or whatever.

PS: Here is a sample from what a job I did:

  

***Original transliterated text:*** ***Text as interpreted by OCR***
