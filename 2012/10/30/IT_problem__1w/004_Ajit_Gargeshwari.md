Dear Vimamla Sharma,  
  
Do you mean Sayanas commentary on the Vedas and Brahmanas and Aranyakas ? I don't think Sayana has written any commentary on Upanishads. Sayana commentary on the Vedas and Brahmanas an Aranyakas are available at DLI website. What do you mean by Early upanishads are looking for any specific upanishads
