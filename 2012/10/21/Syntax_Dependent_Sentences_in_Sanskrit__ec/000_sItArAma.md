Namaste,

its said that sanskrit is not syntax dependent like english and other languages, words can be arranged in any order it will convey the same meaning. As shown in the example below

  

**Cat drinks milk. Milk drinks cat.** (Changes the meaning completely)

  

are there any such sentences in sanskrit that can cause havoc by mare rearrangement of words in a different order.

  

regards
