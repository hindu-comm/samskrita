Dear Madam,

  

Please read earlier messages also instead of only the recent one. 

  

It is already available in the net and I have downloaded and made available in Google Drive if you are using Google Chrome Browser, they are available on clicking the Drive icon. For others I had provided to the link to it, along with one later work on Syntax and Grammar and the Sanskrit Guide to Composition by Apte.

  

Here is the link to my message:

I could not note the names of each which will be available in the document itself in the GDrive itself. The first link itself will take you to Speizers book. The later one is a later one by some Dvivedi and the last by VS Apte.  

  

With regards
