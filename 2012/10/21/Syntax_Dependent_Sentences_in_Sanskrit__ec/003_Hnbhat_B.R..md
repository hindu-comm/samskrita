Really this seems to be debatable. The fact shasthi vibhakti needs another noun to be related it, makes it easy to be related with the noun following it immediately than those nouns preceding it or following it after it many words. This makes the syntactical relation easier, than the the syntactical order is flexible. We keep the words in the order in the languages familiar to us in the fixed order making us easier appreciation, when the order is changed for metrical purpose in shloka-s mostly. But there are easier structures also keeping kartr - karma - kriya syntactical order commonly understandable to Indian language speakers. But the meanings of the words are decided by the inflection of the words by vibhakti-s and some vibhakti-s need collocation of another word either indeclinable or verb. but they are not dependent on their order. but only relation is fixed.

  

For the many of them are not used in the beginning of the words conjunctive ca, and api are of the fixed order, coordinate the word preceeding them. raamasyaapi gaavaH, gaavo raamasyaapi krishnasya? api raamasya gaavaH? making the slight change changing into question, which is inherent in the word api itself, than the order. But it depends on the meaning.

  

Of course, we can change if we want, any order to give the relative meaning slightly according to the language order we are familiar. In Sanskrit it is flexible and we can make use of it to get our desired meaning.

  

Hope this throws some light on the fact.
