"The other 'vibhakti's can also be similarly moved around, modifying the meaning" - This is very likely an incorrect statement. As the 'vibhakti' we choose for a word is dictated by its relationship to the 'kriyA padam'.

  

'avyayas' like 'api', 'eva' 'na' can move around, changing the emphasis / meaning in a sentence.
