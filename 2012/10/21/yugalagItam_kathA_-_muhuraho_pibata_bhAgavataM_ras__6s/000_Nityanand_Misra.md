Namaḥ Śrīrādhākṛṣṇayugalamūrtaye  

  

निगमकल्पतरोर्गलितं फलं शुकमुखादमृतद्रवसंयुतम् ।  
पिबत भागवतं रसमालयं मुहुरहो रसिका भुवि भावुकाः ॥

nigamakalpatarorgalitaṃ phalaṃ śukamukhādamṛtadravasaṃyutam ।  
pibata bhāgavataṃ rasamālayaṃ muhuraho rasikā bhuvi bhāvukāḥ ॥

The tenth canto of the Śrīmadbhāgavatam has several Gītas which describe the divine love of the Vraja Gopīs for Lord Śrīkṛṣṇa. This divine love is the example given by Nārada in the Nārada Bhakti Sūtra - यथा व्रजगोपिकानाम् । (yathā vrajagopikānām ।)  

  

One such Gīta is the Yugalagītam (35th chapter of the 10th canto). A seven-day Kathā by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya on the Yugalagītam will be held from October 23 to October 29 at Hasanpur, Amroha (Jyotiba Phule Nagar) district, Uttar Pradesh. The Kathā will be primarily in Hindi, interspersed with musical renditions of Samskrita verses, Anvaya and explanations of the original Samskrita text, expounding of the topic and Bhajanas in Braja, Awadhi, Bhojpuri and other languages. Bhaktas can watch the live telecast of the Kathā on Sanskar TV. Please forward the email to those who may be interested.  

  

I am attaching an article in Hindi on Śrīmadbhāgavatam by Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya. The article is from the book Ṣaṣṭipūrti Abhinandana Grantha the details of which can be found in the post on Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā on this forum.
