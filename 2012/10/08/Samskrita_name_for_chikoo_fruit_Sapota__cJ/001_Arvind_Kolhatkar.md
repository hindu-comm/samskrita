Pavananandan,

  

A name for the chikoo fruit is unlikely to exist in classical Sanskrit.
Like theubiquitouschili, potato, tomato, tobacco it came to the Old World after the Spanish conquests in South America in the 16th century, where these crops are native.

  

That is also true of groundnut, tea, coffee, all of which came to India from outside in much later days.

  

A long list of plants and crops of Classical India may be seen in the AmarakoSha.
