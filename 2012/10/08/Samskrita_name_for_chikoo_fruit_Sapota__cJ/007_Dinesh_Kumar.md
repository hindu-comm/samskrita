Dear Members of Samskrita,  
Namaskara !!!!!!!!!  
  

If you want to know more about any vegetable (used in India),

I would like to recommend the NMPB database from the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB), Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.

Though it’s a database for medicinal plants(used in ayurveda etc), one can find details of most of the vegetables/ edible plants.

Link:

This database, in electronic form, is now being developed by IAIM-FRLHT with financial support by NMPB so that it is hosted on NMPB website/Portal for appropriate use by the practitioners of Indian Systems of Medicine, herbal industries, scholars, researchers, resource managers as well as policy makers. The first version of this database correlates **7263 botanical names** with around **1,00,000 vernacular names** of plants entities in nine different languages .It also** includes \> 5000 plant images** of medicinal plants and appropriately linked to the proper botanical names.

One can search a plant using botanical name OR any of the vernacular names from languages viz Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Marathi, Kannada, Urdu, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Tibetan.
