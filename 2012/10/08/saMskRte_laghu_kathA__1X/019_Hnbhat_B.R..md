Sorry. The वार्त्तिक reads completely

  

यजेः कर्मणः करणसञ्ज्ञा वक्तव्या, सम्प्रदानस्य च कर्मसञ्ज्ञा ।

  

which means the objectकर्मof the "verb" यज् to offer something, the thing offered is transferred from the position कर्म (taking accusative case) to करण, (taking Instrumental case, and the संप्रदान (the person to whom the thing is offered) is transferred to the position of कर्म (taking the accusative case, with the change, than the normal dative case for संप्रदान). This is the special case of shift of the positions of कारक assigned in the case of the verb "yaj".
