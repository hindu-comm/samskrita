Yes, that was me asking 8-9 months back. After that, I started  
learning LSK by using the classes by Swamiji Ramakrishnan  
(Shastranetralaya.org) and found it very interesting and easier mode -  
as the medium of coaching is in Tamil - my mother tongue. I also  
bought the DVDs of Swami Tatvavidananda and going through the lessons  
- (thanks to Vasu Srinivasan mahodaya for mentioning about the DVDs).
