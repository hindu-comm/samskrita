Hi,

First, I earnestly thank you for correcting my mistakes. I understand  
from what you have mentioned here, first to practice reading stories  
like Hitopadesa, Panchatantra, Chandamama etc. then start practice  
writing, correct?

I first tried to read Panchatantra, but I found it very very  
difficult. I am not a student by traditional way of learning so I  
don't know Sandhi very well. (I am now started learning LSK though.)  
So sentences like this:

  
तन्न किंचिदिह बुद्धिमतां असाध्यं अस्ति \|

I faint down. :)

Also for each and every word I have to refer dictionary. In a day I  
don't even read more than 5-10 lines. I find Samskrit chandamama  
really useful. I find the words simple and understandable. I have been  
reading chandamama, Sudharma, Sambhashana Sandesha, Saampratam etc for  
the last two years. I could understand them but when I start writing  
simple words on my own, it becomes a big deal. I also purchased  
government school books for Sanskrit (I std to IV std) and practicing  
the abhyasa portion of it. Many of them have no answers so I couldn't  
correct myself. Therefore, for what its worth, I started posting  
stories of my own words and hope to get corrected.

Thanks,  
Srikanth.
