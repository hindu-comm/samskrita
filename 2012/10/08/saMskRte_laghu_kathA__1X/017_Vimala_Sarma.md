Bhatt Mahodaya

Is there a mistake in this sentence from the Key by Apte?

*(a)*¹In the case of the root यज् 'to sacrifice' or 'to give as in a sacrifice,' the person to whom the sacrifice is offered is put in the Instrumental; as, पशुना रुद्रं यजते (Siddhāntakaumudī) 'he sacrifices a bull to Rudra.'

The person to whom the sacrifice is offered is accusative and the thing to be sacrificed is instrumental.
