This from the part of Key. The regular Lessons are there in their own order. I could not even understood what he is saying he does not get the key to the exercises. I think this will be enough to use the lessons with Key to the relevant exercise which is enriched with photos and explanations for the words. I think he himself, had not compiled the key:

  

****A**Key to Apte's Guide to Sanskrit composition**: giving a close rendering into English and Sanskrit of all the Sanskrit and English sentences / compiled by an experienced graduate teacher. -- 2d ed. -- Bombay : Standard Pub., 1923.and it was compiled by another person. I don't think this book is available in pdf form, while the guide is downloadable from archives:

by clicking here directly while the online Key in the above can be referred to all the lessons in order in the page itself added separately.
