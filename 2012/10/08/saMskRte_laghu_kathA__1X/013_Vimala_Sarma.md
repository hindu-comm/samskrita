Dear Srikanth  
You may like to start with Lanmanś Sanskrit Reader. It has an incorporated dictionary for words in the reader and grammar notes. There are crossɍeferences to Whitneyś grammar but you do not need Whitney to story with. The first story is on Nala has no sandhi and complexity is gradually introduced. There are extracts from hitopadesha and Saritsāgara, an the some gṛhasāstras and vedas. I think you will find it useful.
