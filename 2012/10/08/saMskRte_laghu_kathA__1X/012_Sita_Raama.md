In the above link you would fine some nice lessons, I am not sure if you already worked on them. This would be a good exercise for you to translate simple sentences.

Reading Chandamama and other story books help, if you could also add Valmiki Ramayanam to your reading list, it will help you a lot.

Here is a good resource online<http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/vr_index.htm>

  

Do the anvaya first on your own after reading the shloka and then look for Sandhis and then gothroughthe meaning and it should help you.
