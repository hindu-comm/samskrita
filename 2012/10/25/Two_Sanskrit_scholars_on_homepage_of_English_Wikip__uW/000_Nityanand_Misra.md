Namaste  
  
It is an honour for Samskrita that two of the greatest living Samskrita authors and scholars, Paṇḍitaratna Revāprasāda Dvivedī of Jabalpur and Jagadguru Rāmānandacārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya of Chitrakoot, are currently featured on the homepage of English Wikipedia under the "Did You Know" section.  
  
This last from 12:00 noon to 8:00 PM EST (New York time) on October 26 2012.  
  
I have attached a snapshot for people who miss this.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
