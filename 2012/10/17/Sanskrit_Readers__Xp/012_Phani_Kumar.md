Sir,

Your info is valuable. Vadhyar and sons' books are well known.

It may not be necessary for scholars recommending books or publishers to invariably mention they are not related to the author/publisher. No member of the group is likely to attribute such motives to the eminent scholars of this group helping others with names of books.
