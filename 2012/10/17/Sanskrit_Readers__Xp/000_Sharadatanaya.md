Dear all  
  
Every sanskrit learner will suffer with a question how to learn  
sanskrit?  
There are various inst all over the country, and lot of readers from  
early 20th century to till now.  
I have made a small survey referring many readers to choose a standard  
one. finally the one which stands at the top is Readers by K L V  
Sastry  
they are printed in the series called Sanskrit Study Made easy Vadhyar  
and sons Palghat and the name of the books are Baladarsa,  
Prathamadarsa , Dviteeyadarsa, Trteeyadarsa. Along with this  
Sabdamanjari and Dhatumanjari should be referred by same author. There  
institutions I have seen they are keeping this as text books from more  
than 50 years. Umpteen number of scholars today learned sanskrit from  
these books. I am not related to Vadhyar and sons. This is mere  
exchange of information. you can get Baladarsa, Triteeyadarsa etc  
online DIL and archive websites.  
  
Regards
