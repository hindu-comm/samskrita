R.S.Vadhyar & sons' books are available at VIJAYA Stores ( who sell school text books), Mylaapre, South Mada Street, Chennai. From my experience, the material is good ; but the print is not at all good : very smudged.When there are double and triple aksharas get combined, it is very difficult to decipher. Hence, the reading becomes v. slow. Still I read these books with the help of a dictionary.
