There are so many verbs for chasing in the dictionary, of which मृगयति is also available, from which मृगया is derived, meaning hunting. अनुद्रवति is also available, which means chase after. अनुद्रुतः = chased.

  

For पलायते - परा+अय गतौ is the Paninian derivation.उपसर्गस्यायतौ "८।२।१९। makes the prefix into ल् - पलायते।

  

It is to be noted that there are no synonyms even within a language exactly and it will be too much to expect exact synonyms for translations between two languages alien to each other in structure and idiomatic use. Better to accept dictionary made words or idiomatic to the target language to convey almost near to the source language. Otherwise, forced translation won't convey anything similar or dissimilar to both the languages.
