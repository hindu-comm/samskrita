Dear All,  
I would like to bring it to the notice of the group that Gaekwad Oriental Series by M.S. University, Baroda  
published many rare books.  
I recently found a complete list of books, author, editor, edition details from them.  
I have prepared a pdf for those who might be interested in the books...  
Some of them are available for sale at  
M.S. University Publications sales unit, AYCS building, General Education Center, D.N. Hall Cricket Ground,  
Pratapgand, Vadodara - 390002.  
  
Those books which are out of print are available for reference at  
Oriental Institute,  
M.S. University,  
Palace Gate,  
Palace Road,  
Vadodara - 390001
