Dear Scholars,  
  
For my learning purposes, I want to know if an explanation can given  
on a set of sutras which defines each vibhakti and what it means in  
Sutra patha. I can write and down and memorize them. For example,  
"sashti sthaane yoga", "tasminniti nirdishte poorvasya" etc.  
  
I learnt from one of the lessons that Shasti vibhakti Shatruvat  
(replaces/removes), Panchami vibhakti mitravat (adds)..  
  
Please let me know if there is any collection of such sutras with  
meaning.  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
