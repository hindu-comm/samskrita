Please ask your question directly what do you want to know without any round about unnecessary explanations of your own.

  

If you want to know the meanings of the सूत्र-s in अष्टाध्यायी, there are many cites offering lessons and many others offering explanations in their data base as this one:

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/>

  

where you can scroll down the अष्टाध्यायी in order from the very first सूत्र. Otherwise there are many links provided in some of the topics in our group for learning including audio lessons of लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी, सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, काशिका etc which you can make use of. Please search for them in the group. You can refer to the text of the above mentioned books available online in lessons and downloadable pdf versions in परिभाषा-प्रकरण if you want to know only the type of the सूत्र-s quoted for memorizing only. You can also listen to the audio lessons of them for memorizing them.

  

With regards
