नमो वः।  
  
On Lambert's "Introduction to Devanagari Script for the students of sanskrit..." it's said that the combining form of श śa, like the one in श्री śrī, is an older form of that letter. Is it really so? In that case, which script uses it as the normal form?

I've found this table for the Nāgarī script, but its palatal fricative (श śa) seems to be like Devanāgarī's retroflex one (ष ṣa), and its retroflex fricative have a distinct form, so this script doesn't seem to have an older form of श śa.  
  
  
Thanks in advance!
