With respect to pronounciation, I have noticed few of other peculiar  
ones  
  
1. Pronounciation of ha-kara, in ब्रह्म - while writing we write  
brahma but pronounce somewhat like bramha - the weight of hakara  
somehow shifted after the makara.. I guess there is a reason for this  
too.  
  
2. Pronounciation of ज्ञ - some people pronounce this with ज् - ञ  
distinctly; some others pronounce like ग्ञ (ग + ञ) - सर्वज्ञ is  
pronounced like सर्वग्ञ  
  
3. Pronounciation of ऋ - in some English books, its mentioned as Ri  
but almost all pronounce it as Ru
