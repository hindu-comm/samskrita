Far from being a silly doubt, the question requires a serious discussion. The "correct" pronunciation of the Visarga, in old times, was an unvoiced breath accompanying (or probably following?) a vowel, pronounced without changing the mouth position. I believe विसर्जनीय and विसर्ग are what we call अन्वर्थकसंज्ञाs in grammar, i.e. apt nomenclatures, as they come from वि सृज् meaning to emit or throw or release (breath).  
  
The pronunciations of सः ("He"), "सह्" (the root meaning "to bear or suffer", among other meanings) and सह (the indeclinable) must all have been different. Else in the oral tradition one could not distinguish between these three, or between words like वराः (grooms, or the best ones) and वराह (boar) - the former takes three मात्राs to pronounce, the latter takes four.  
  
It seems even in the time of Monier Monier Williams (19th century), the visarga was pronounced "correctly" in some parts of India, for he writes under विसर्जनीय (italics are mine):  
  
"Pandits in *some parts of India* seem to pronounce a vowel after it , e.g. नरः like नरह , अग्निः like अग्निहि)"  
  
which would mean that in some other parts, the additional vowel was not added while pronouncing Visarga.  
  
Pronunciations which add an additional vowel after ह् (नरह for नरः and नराह for नराः), though handed down by traditional schools, are incorrect as they have one extra syllable which would break prosodic rules in poetry for both वर्णवृत्त metres (for all svaras) and मात्रावृत्त metres (for दीर्घ svaras), and would make many words indistinguishable.  
  
This page has an audio file giving two different pronunciations. <http://www.learnsanskrit.org/sounds/consonants/anusvara>
