विसर्ग ः is a weak voiceless fricative that varies in place of construction in accordance with the various consonants as laid down in grammar books . The existence of विसर्ग as a phonetic reality has been both accepted and denied. Evidence in the Prātiśākhyas points to the phonetic existence of several spirants written ḫ These spirants, जिह्वामूलीय and उपूपध्मानीया, are shown to be allophones of विसर्ग, which in turn is interpreted as a subclass of the s phoneme.   
  

विसर्ग is an allophones of /r/ and /s/ in pausa (at the end of an utterance). Since /-s/ is a common inflectional suffix (of nominative singular, second person singular, etc.), विसर्ग appears frequently in Sanskrit texts. In the traditional order of Sanskrit sounds, विसर्ग together with अनुस्वार appears between vowels and stop consonants.

The precise pronunciation of विसर्ग in Vedic texts may vary between shakhas. Some pronounce a slight echo of the preceding vowel after the fricative, for example aḥ will be pronounced \[ɐhᵄ\], and iḥ will be pronounced \[ihⁱ\].
