Letters may be viewed with reference to their Pitch, Prosodial length, Organ of utterance, Nasality, Effort and Breath.  
  
For pitch see SK 5,6, and 7  
  
For Prosodial length see SK 31 32, 33 and 34  
  
A measure of the length is provided by panini 1.2.27 please see SK 4  
  
The letter ऊ is taken with 3 prosodial lengths of 1, 2 and 3 matras by way of a sample and one cann apply to other vowels.  
  
For Organ of utterance  
1 Throat is the organ of pronunciation for अ कवर्ग ह अण्ड ा: and partially of ए ऎ ऒ and औ as set out in अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठ: and एदैतो : कण्ठतालु and ओदौतो : कण्ठोष्ठम्  
2 The palate is the organ for and इ and चवर्ग , य and श as also partially for ए and ऎ. इचुयशानां तालु and एदैतो : कण्ठतालु  
3 The cerebrum the organ for ऋ, टवर्ग, र and ष ऋटुरषाणां मूर्धा  
4 The teeth for लृ the तवर्गल and स and partially for व लृतुलासानां दन्ताः \| वकारस्य दन्तोष्ठम्  
5 The lips for उ पवर्ग and partially for ओ and औ उपूपध्मानीयानामोष्ठौ \| ओदौतो : कण्ठोष्ठम्  
6 The root of the tongue for क ख as per जिह्वामूलीयस्य जिह्वामूलम्  
7 The nose is an additional organ for Nasals ञमङमणनानां नासिका च and other legitimate one.. They are ञ, म, ङ, ण, न and Anusvara नासिकानुस्वारस्य.  
  
Effort is of two kinds Internal and external.  
Internal efforts take place just before articulation. Thus before च, ट,
त or any of the other letters of these groups is attempted to be pronounced, the tongue is brought in to contact with palate, cerebrum or teeth respectively. In the case of क one part of the throat come into complete contact with another part of it and in the case of the प group, the upper lip completely touches the lower.  
  
These complete contact are called स्पृष्टप्रयत्न . To pronounce य र ल व
the toungue and the respective organs are brought into contact; but the contact is only partial. this effort is called ईषत्स्पृष्टप्रयत्न  
Vowels and श ष स हare pronounced with the organs kept open and this effort is called विवृतप्रयत्न  
  
There is another effort called संवृतप्रयत्न please see rule of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्.  
  
Effort External:  
  
With respect to the disposition of the organs while pronunciation continues this kind of Effort is divided into 3 varieties and is of 11 kinds विवार: संवार: अल्पप्राण : महाप्राण :श्वास: नाद: उदात्त : अनुदात्त: अघोष: घोष: स्वरित:  
1, 3, 5 are qualities that contrast with 2,4 and 6 and the sets have peculiarities.  
  
विवृत is different from विवार  
अ has 2 internal efforts विवृत and संवृत and one external effort विवार, which means that the organs are kept open before beginning to emit breath and continue to be so kept while breath is ejected.  
  
With respect to the manner in which breath is ejected, letters are divided into श्वास contrasting with नाद; अघोष: contrasting with घोष:;
विवार:with  संवार: अल्पप्राण with महाप्राण.  
  
क च ट त प ख छ ठ थ फ क श ष स प ा: are of विवार, श्वास and अघोष (Hard consonants  
ग ज ड द ब ञ म ङ न ण य र ल व are संवार , नाद and घोष  
similarly for अल्पप्राण with महाप्राण.  
  
External efforts of various letters are set out in the Karika  
  
खयां यमाः खय: क:पौ विसर्ग: शर एव च \|  
एते श्वासानुप्रदानाः अघोषाश्चा विवृण्वते\|\|  
कण्ठम् अन्ये तु घोषा: स्यु: संवृता नादभागिन : \|  
अयुग्मा वर्गयमगा यणश्चाल्पास्वः स्मृता:\|\|  
  
A letter pronounced both by its proper organ and the nose is a anunasika. please see SK 9 and Panini 1.1.8  
  
The 14 M sutras don't exhaust the whole group of linguistic material.
Certain letters not included in them are is use. Visarga: anusvara 3 Jihvamuliya which is visarga followed by क ख upadhmaniya, which is visarga followed by प फ and are represented by two curves placed be fore them. All these four kinds of letters are called Ayogavahas though not enumerated in the M sutras are capable of being employed in speech.  
  
There is a group of letters called yama used in the vedas. These donot add to the number of letters in the langauge, nor do they affect pronunciation.
