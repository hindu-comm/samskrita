I think Panini listed the articulation points only in his सूत्र-s and not how it is heard by the speakers. I think he has not explained anything about how it is spoken by the speaker and how it is heard by the hearer. There may be difference due to the influence of other language certainly working at background as I know all of Indian Speakers of Sanskrit today have their own language for everyday life. I have no words about the so called संस्कृतग्राम of Mattur village in Shivamogga in Karnataka. All others are certainly apt to be influenced by their mother tongue.
