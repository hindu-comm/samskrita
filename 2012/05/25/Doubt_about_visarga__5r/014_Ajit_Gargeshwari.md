ṛ- and ḷ-vowels. To the three simple vowels Sanskrit adds two others, the ṛ-vowel and the ḷ-vowel, plainly generated by the abbreviation of syllables containing respectively a र् r or ल् l along with another vowel: the ऋ ṛ coming almost always from अर् ar or र ra, the ḷ from अल् al.

Some grammarians add to the alphabet also a long ḷ: but this is only for the sake of symmetry, since the sound does not occur in a single genuine word in the language.

The vowel ऋ ṛ is simply a smooth or untrilled *r*-sound, assuming a vocalic office in syllable-making — as, by a like abbreviation, The vowel ऌ ḷ is an *l*-sound similarly uttered — like the English l-vowel in such words as *able, angle, addle*.

I have heard people pronounce these vowels as *ri, rī, li* (or even *lri*), having long lost the habit and the facility of giving a vowel value to the pure *r*- and *l*-sounds. Their example is widely followed by European scholars; and hence also the (distorting and altogether objectionable) transliterations ṛi, ṛī, ḷi. There is no real difficulty in the way of acquiring and practising the true utterance.

Some of the grammarians (see APr. i. 37, note) attempt to define more nearly the way in which, in these vowels, a real *r*- or *l*-element is combined with something else.

Like their corresponding semivowels, r and l, these vowels belong respectively to general lingual and dental classes; the euphonic influence of ṛ and ṝ shows this clearly. They are so ranked in the Paninean scheme; but the Prātiçākhyas in general strangely class them with the jihvāmūlīya sounds, our “gutturals”  

The short ṛ is found in every variety of word and of position, and is not rare, being just about as frequent as long ū. Long ṝ is very much more unusual, occurring only in certain plural cases of noun-stems in ṛ (371 b, d, 375). The ḷ is met with only in some of the forms and derivatives of a single not very common verbal root (kḷp).

The whole spoken alphabet, then, may be arranged in the following manner, in order to show, so far as is possible in a single scheme, the relations and important classifications of its various members:
