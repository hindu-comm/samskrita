namaste,  
  
This may be a silly doubt, please accept my apologies.  
A friend of mine asked this doubt, in Sanskrit when we pronounce the  
visarga with svaras, it goes like  
  
अ: - aha  
आ: - aaha  
इ: - ihi..  
..  
ए: - ye-hey  
\*ऐ: - ai-hi\*  
ओ: - oho  
\*औ: - au-hu\*  
  
here, for ऐ औ, the visarga doesn't go similar to the svara. The doubt  
is why is this so? Is there any rules in grammar for this? Is this  
common around all over Bharat?  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
