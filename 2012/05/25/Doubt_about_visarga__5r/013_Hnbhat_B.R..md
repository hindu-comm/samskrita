I think Mr.Ajith has already referred to the archived discussions. The Paniniya Shiksha - mentions about the consonants in conjunction with ह् as follows:

  

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तस्थाभिश्च संयुतम् ।

*औरस्यं तं विजानीयात्*कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ॥१६॥  
  

This has been backed up by प्रातिशाख्य-s also sometimes giving illustrations from Vedic usage as in the case of विसर्ग.

  

The second also was already discussed and finally it is attributed to regional variation in pronunciation under the influence of regional languages.

  

The last it seems presents little more problem to differentiate it from the consonant र् and and in a word निरृति only the distinction is obvious to be maintained. Hence to differentiate them, some sort of convention used regionally either with इ or उ as convenient for pronunciation. Thee is seems not ne any प्रातिशाख्य or शिक्षा in support of such distinction. This Ri and Ru in English represents two different encoding in roman to get converted ऋ and used in writing generally in the websites as many are not familiar with diacritical use of the sameṛ equivalent to ऋ used by Indologists to transcribe it. 

  

Thanks Ajit for bringing up the old thread again.
