Namaste Everyone

Is this the correct way to understand Paribhasha concept in AshTAdhyAyi.

  

1\. There are **Numbers** - 2, 3 (Sangya)

2\. **Odd** & Even - 3   (Sangya)

3\. **All Prime are** - 4 (Paribhasha)

4\. Except two  (Exception - Can it be called Niyama? or is it Vidhi?)

  

===== Vrutti formations are shown below =====

1.  That measures count get Numbers Sangya 2.  Odd & Even are numbers 3.  All prime numbers are odd.
4.  All prime numbers are odd except two.

  

I highlighted text as shown in theAshTAdhyAyi book by Dr. Gopalashastry.

I am trying this simple example to understand the basic structure, I am sure it is not as simple as the example quoted above but will be a good start to build good foundation. If there are other example to understand these concepts better please share it.

  

I would appreciate scholars remarks on this concept.
