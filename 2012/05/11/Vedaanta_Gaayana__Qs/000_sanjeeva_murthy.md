His Holiness Paramahamsa Sri Sri Satchidaanandendra Saraswathi Swamiji, the founder of Adhyaatma Prakaasha Kaaryaalaya at Holenarasipur (Hassan Dist., Karnataka State ) and its branches in Bangalore the author of over 250 reputed works on advaita philosophy in English, Sanskrit & Kannada , blessed the earth with his presence for ninety six useful years ( 1880 – 1975 ).

In the year 1915 when he was only thirty five years of age he noticed the accretions that had crept into Shankara Siddhantha, by the commentators and he felt the need to rediscover the real Shankara free from these accretions.  
He strove single handedly topropagateand popularize **parishuddha shankara vEdanta siddhAnta**. Age and ailments did not deter him. His works born out of intuitive experience are characterized by vast and deep scholarship, clear and precise perception. His authentic interpretation of Shankara has been greatly recognized in the East and the West. He was not just a rare and accomplished individual but a mighty andmagnificentinstitution.

His sayings based on real Shankara are universal in appeal. For example -

1\. Vedanta is a Science of Reality.

2\. Anyone who is eager to know the true nature of the self can understand the teachings of Vedaanta.

3\. Vedaanta is a positive science founded on reason, intuition and universal experience, etc..

He was initiated in to Vedaata by the then pontiff of ShringEri Sri Shivaabhinava Nrisimha Bharathi Swamiji, at Kaaladi and he had come under the influence of saintly scholars such as Brahma Chaitanya Maharaj of Gondavali and Kurthukoti Mahabhagavatar.  
The Karyaalaya founded by revered Swamiji in his former Ashrama is registered public charitable institution. His Highness Sri Jayachamarajendra Odeyar Bahaddur of Mysore was the Paripalaka of the Karyalaya. Their Holinesses The Shankaracharyas of ShringEri, Dwaraka and Kanchi encouraged the institution by graciously granting some monetary help as a token of their recognition of the activities of the Karyalaya.

Vedantic classes and lectures of**prasthAnatrayee**are regular daily routine. Swamiji has constructed a Digvijaya Rama Temple at Holenarasipur to which daily services are rendered even today.Thus the institution is spreading the essence of Vedanta to all human beings
which is irrespective of caste, creed, sex, nationality, age, etc.. which is every ones birthright to know the real self or mOksha as stated by the great Shankara-

**anubhavaavasThaanatvaat bhUtavastu viShayatvaaachcha
Brahmajnaanasya- Br.Su. Bha.**

The sole purpose of his life was to spread the real tradition
-**Shaankara Sampradaaya**– of Vedanta i.e.**AdhyArOpa apavAda prakriya**as pointed / recognized by **Shankara** in **Bhagavadgeeta Bhaasya**. Swamiji is the first person to notice & discover this in Bhagavadgeeta Shaankara Bhaashya.He explained its significance and importance in understanding the messages of**prasthAnatrayee**. His approach to the subject is analytical. He made a comprehensive and comparitative study of all the Vedantic thinkers who lived prior to Shankara as also those who lived after Shankara. Even to-day his sayings are vibrant and living which are being spread through his lectures in English, Sanskrit and Kannada by his direct and intimate disciple Bramharshi Adhyaatma Vidyaa Praveena Mahamahopadhyaya .Sri K.G. Subbaraya Sharmaji, an equally energetic vibrant pundit who travelled in U.S. with Sanjeeva Murthy in 1995 to spread unique teachings of Vedaanta & Shankara.

His sole aim is to spread the messages in Shaankara Bhaashya and keep alive the sacred memory of the revered Swamiji through lectures, books etc. He was also the editor of the popular Kannada trimonthly magazine –**Shankara Bhaskara**. He has also written ShAnkara saMvatsara, vEdantasaMvatsara , BhagavatgeethasaMvatsaraprabOdha chintAmaNi
which has been published in Kannada, Samskrutam, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Urdu, Marathi, Malayalam, English and also several books in Kannada .

Swamiji lived a full life engrossed in vedantic thoughts , always right from morning till he slept and till he shuffled off his mortal coil, in accordance with the saying**AsupterAmruteh kAlam nayed vEdanta chintayA** quoted by H.H. Paramaachaarya of Kaanchi mutt in 1945.

    Excellency Chaturvedi** at Raj Bhavan.

    An interesting point worth mentioning here is that Shri.Sanjeeva
    Murthy has been associated with Ubhaya Gana Vidushi
    Dr.Shyamala.G.Bhave for several years to have a greater
    understanding of music and his inclination with Indian Classical
    Music has helped him come out with musical renditions coupled with
    commentaries and lectures on all the above-mentioned subjects. It
    is therefore felt that Shri. Sanjeeva Murthy would be an ideal
    person to interact with the audience especially where Vedaantic
    Music programmes are involved in order to enlighten them on the
    Spiritual and Philosophical interpretations and other aspects of the
    Chants /Shlokas/ Compositions that may be rendered musically in the
    course of such sessions. Main intension is to spread the quint
    essence of Shaankaraadvaitha Vedaanta to all mankind.
