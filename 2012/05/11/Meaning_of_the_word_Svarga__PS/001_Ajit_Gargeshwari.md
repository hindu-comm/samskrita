In Hinduism, **Svarga** (or **Swarga**) (Sanskrit: स्वर्ग) is a set of heavenly worlds located on and above Mt. Meru. It is a heaven where the righteous live in a paradise before their next reincarnation. Svarga is seen as a transitory place for righteous souls who have performed good deeds in their lives but are not yet ready to attain moksha, or elevation to Vaikunta, the abode of Lord Vishnu, considered to be the Supreme Abode (Rig Veda (1.22.20) states, *Oṃ tad viṣṇoḥ paramam padam sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ:* "All the suras (i.e., the devas) look towards the feet of Lord Vishnu as the Supreme Abode"). The capital of Svarga is Amaravati and its entrance is guarded by Airavata. Svarga is presided over by Indra, the chief deva.

This is a "Good and nice" kind of temporary heaven where the soul enjoys all its Punya karmam before attaining either moksha, or rebirth according to its Karma.

**Svarga** (Sanskrit) In Hindu philosophy, a heavenly abode -- also often called Indraloka, or Svarloka, said to be situated on Mount Meru. It corresponds in theosophical writings to devachan.
