Dear all,  
"Maatr pancakam" supposed to have been composed by Adi Shankara in memory of his mother is available at  
<http://mahaperiyavaa.wordpress.com/2012/05/13/mathru-panchagam/>\>  
It is not in the " stotra" volume of Shankara's works published by Vanivilas Press.  
The version at this site, especially trnsliterated in a non-standard way into Roman script, appears full of errors.  
I would like to have access to the hymn in devanagari script. I am seeking guidance.  
Regards,  
Murthy
