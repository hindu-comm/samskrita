Madhya Kaumudi doesn't seem to be very popular, as students study the  
Laghu and then move on to study Siddhanta Kaumudi directly I guess. By  
volume of content, Laghu Kaumudi has about 1000+ Sutras, Madhya  
Kaumudi has 2000+ Sutras.  
  
In another book, I read that Bhattoji Dikshita upon seeing this Madhya  
Kaumudi work, was annoyed that such a work would in fact discourage  
students from studying the entire Siddhanta Kaumudi and this Madhya  
Kaumudi would usurp SK's place in the field of learning.  
  
Anyways while Googling I saw that Swami Dayananda Saraswati (Arya  
Samaj) studied Madhya Siddhanta Kaumudi first and then he found its  
lacking in some places and hence went on to study Siddhanta Kaumudi. I  
am wondering if there are any traditional schools/modern colleges now  
teaching Madhya Siddhanta Kaumudi.  
  
Other than that, my assumption is for a Sanskrit student, studying  
laghu and then moving to the Siddhanta Kaumudi is the right path,  
scholars may help here whether this is correct assumption. This is one  
of the reasons I asked what is Madhya Siddhanta Kaumudi's place in  
learning Sanskrit... whether this Madhya Kaumudi is any useful to  
anyone...
