Here is the further information on the versions of वैयाकरणसिद्धान्तकौमुदी -

  

``` There are also four abridgements 
of the S. K. and the Manorama, viz., the Madhya, Laghu and Sara 
Kaumudis by Varadaraja, and the Madhya Manorama, an abridgement 
of Bhattoji's Manorama by Kama Sarma. 
```

A commentary, by Rama S'arma, on the Madhya Kaurnudi of

``` Yaradaraja, which is an abridgement of the S'iddhanta Kaumudi of 
 Bhattoji Dikshita. The Madhya Manorama is, as the name imports, 
an abridgement of the Praudha Manorama of Bhattoji on his great 
I compilation of the Siddhanta Kaumndi. It is adapted to the com- 
pendium which Yaradaraja, a disciple of Bhattoji-Dikshita, had made 
from the elaborate Siddhanta Kaumudi of his preceptor. Yaradaraja 
made a smaller abridgement of his master's work, and called it the 
Laghu Kaumudi, which is largely used by beginners in the Upper 
Frovinces of India. According to Aufreeht's Bodleyan Catalogue, 
p. 165, there is another abridgement of the great Siddhanta Kaumudi, 
~ahd it is known under the name of Sara-Kaumudi, (vide No. 820 
Notices of Sanskrit Manuscripts.) Nothing can be said with cer- 
tainty concerning the time and place of Bamachandra S'arma, the 
author, nor of S'ivananda Bhatta or Gosain at whose request this 
work was written, nor about Yidyauivasa, the tutor or spiritual guide 
of the author. The names suggest the idea that they were all Fanelita 
of Bengal.
