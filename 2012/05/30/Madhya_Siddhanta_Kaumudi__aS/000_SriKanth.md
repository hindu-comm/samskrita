Dear Scholars,

I happen to get this book Madhya Siddhanta Kaumudi (mlbd publisher)...  
I am now studying the Laghu Kaumudi alone and I am not venturing to  
start learning this Madhya Kaumudi yet. However I want to know, what  
is the place for Madhya Siddhanta Kaumudi and what its significance  
is... I see all the prakaranas in this book similar to the Siddhanta  
Kaumudi.

From the preface of the book, it looks like similar to Siddhanta  
Kaumudi, this Madhya Kaumudi also has a Madhya Manorama commentary and  
that is the only pracheena vyakhyaa available. The mangala sloka on  
that commentary goes like this:

माहेश्वरं नमस्कृत्य पाणिन्यादीन् मुनीनपि \|  
करोमिमध्यकौमुद्या व्याख्यां मध्यमनोरमाम् \|\|

It is mentioned this madhya manorama is incomplete and not available  
entirely.

The book I got is having a different Sanskrit commentary by name  
Prabhakari. I already searched this group, I am sure there was no  
discussion on this book in the past. Much obliged if anyone can  
explain about this book.

Thanks,  
Sri.
