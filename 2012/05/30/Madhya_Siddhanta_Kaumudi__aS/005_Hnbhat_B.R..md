It depends on your appetite and standard.

You can start from LKG, UKG, I standard, IInd standard etc. in gradual education or

  

attend I Standard itself if LKG and UKG facilities are not available in your remote area. or join Vth standard itself if you are prepared with informal education with attaining the required standard. There is no such rules regarding the admission to these books laid down by any government.

  

There is one more lower abridgement सारकौमुदी before लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी and मध्यसिद्धान्तकौमुदी.

  

Still basic is learning शब्दमञ्जरी and धातुमञ्जरी equivalent to LKG and UKG with learning काव्य-s like रघुवंश.



Nobody is going to question your capacity, if you learn अष्टाध्यायी itself from the beginning or शब्दमञ्जरी. In modern education, you may not get admission to High School classes without completing Primary Education unless by Private Study you appear directly to SSLC.

  

Here there is no such restriction and convenience and choice is yours.
