As a postscript I can add to the above question, the usefulness of any tool of learning depends on the needs of the learners. Further the above learning tools for students of a time 3-4 centuries ago, when time was at their disposal to study in gradual stages and the it was facilitated by providing the tools needed for their time, than feeding at a time the whole of lump of grammar. It

was meant for a time when learning was done through a teacher only.

  

  

Now the time has changed, and every one is busy and short of time to undergo the whole of Ashtadhyayi or even LS and shortage of teachers the main learning tool of the bye=gone centuries. Now learning tools according to the needs of the present day transition period deviating from the main learning tools the teacher oriented learning and towards e-learning, many tools of learning are made available online including many web pages providing lessons in more attractive way. Hence the usefulness of the 3 centuries old tools may not be the same for today. Here is the search result of this topic in our group:

Survey of the present day tools are done in our group including the necessity and usefulness of learning VyakaraNa itself for knowing Sanskrit language. The morphological Generators and many other tools are provided by the Computational Sanskritists, like Amba Kulkarni for the present day learners:

and among them one Ashtadhyayi simulator is also available which does the same prakriya process as in the SIDDHANTAKAUMUDI. Yet this is the transitional period fro teacher oriented learning method to learner oriented method slanting towards e-learning. At a later time, only e-learning may prevail which may oust out the traditional learning tools.

  

So the usefulness of the learning tools depends on the needs of the user and not on the tools provided at one time. This is the thread in which your question had been raised and discussed long ago:

Hope this will answer your question.
