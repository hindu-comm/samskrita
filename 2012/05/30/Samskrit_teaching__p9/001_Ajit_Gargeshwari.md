Surasarsasvathi Sabha located at Sringeri Mutt premises in Chamrajpete conduct Sanskrit classes so also Bhatiya Vidya Bhavan.  
  
KSOU conducts MA in Sanskrit by correspondence if you have finished 12 standard or II PUC  
  
If you are interested in learning Sanskrit in a traditional way you can go to Bangalore Sanskrit College where they offer different Sanskrit courses that lead to Vidvat degree.
