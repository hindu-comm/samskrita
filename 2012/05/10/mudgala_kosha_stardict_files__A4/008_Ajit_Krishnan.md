namaste,

  

For offline searches using the stardict files:

-   For the ipad, follow the iphone instructions. The "dictionary
    universal" app works well on both the iphone & ipad. This is what I
    use.

&nbsp;

-   On windows / linux, you might use the "goldendict" app available
    from <http://goldendict.org/>. I tried this on windows, and it
    works okay. You have to "unzip" the tar.gz file which is a little
    bit of a pain on windows. You can do it using the 7-zip app and
    opening the archive once to get the tar file, and then open the tar
    file again to get the folder.

&nbsp;

-   On macs, here are instructions for converting stardict files to the
    native format supported by macs. Please let me know if it
    works:[http://code.google.com/p/mac-dictionary-kit](http://code.google.com/p/mac-dictionary-kit/)



Alternatively, google shows this stardict app for macOS:

sasneham,
