\[Mod. note: \]  
  
We allowed the post about questioning Devanagari vs. Roman script hoping we would get an on-point reply just so that we can move on. Ajit has provided such a reply.  
  
Let us consider that part of the discussion closed. Thanks.  
  
I am sure many of the list members appreciate such efforts. If you want to reiterate your appreciation, please do so off the list.  
  
Further discussion or clarification regarding the software itself is welcome on the list.
