***Namaste  
I want to communicate that not being aware of the Mugdala Kosha existence I did upload it the one I have, for some years, in Internet Archive.  
This my communication directly responsabilizes me and never Internet Archive; if there is here fault, it is totally mine.  
If will be necessary, please tell me, I will attempt to annihilate this antique software from there.  
I deep apologize but my intention has been the best.  
Sincerely yours  
Jonathan
