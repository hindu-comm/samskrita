Ajit,

Please make it clear on these web sites of yours, that the literature, kindly made available for download, is in Devanagari script only.



The web page, being in English with Sanskrit works given in Roman diacritics, misleadingly lead the Devanagari challenged, such as myself to hopefully expect something usefully readable.



l am able to machine transliterate Devanagari texts, if I have to, but pdfs don’t transliterate.



The Sanskrit Cause you allege, is an admirable one, not so the The Devanagari Cause, I would even go as far as to say that Devanagari is Sanskrit’s worst enemy, as far as global recognition is concerned!



As an example of how it’s done, here is a multi-volume work of the world’s first written language, 90 years in the making – and not a Babylonian squiggle in sight!

A linguist may find It very interesting, it can be even downloaded for free, but its rather massive in total.



Eddie
