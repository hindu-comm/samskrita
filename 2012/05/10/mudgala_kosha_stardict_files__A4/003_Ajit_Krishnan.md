Eddie,  
  
As I stated at the end of my mail, I am not trying to cater to you, or  
anyone else. Take it, or leave it, at your discretion. My mail only  
pointed your to a set of stardict files (which state whether or not  
they are in roman script / devanagari) as well as the mudgala kosha  
tool (which understands a wide variety of input and displays text in a  
variety of formats). I did not point this list to any of the other  
texts on my site.  
  
I pretty much expected a reply from you that was full of criticism. In  
the future, please direct these to my personal mailbox, so that I can  
ingnore them and move on with my day.  

  
  
\> As an example of how it’s done  
  

I am in no need of such examples, though I thank you for taking the  
time to make it.  

  
  
\> The Sanskrit Cause you allege, is an admirable one, not so the The  
\> Devanagari Cause  
  

I have my own views on the subject, and have no plans to revise them  
based on your vitriol.  
  
sasneham,  
  
 ajit
