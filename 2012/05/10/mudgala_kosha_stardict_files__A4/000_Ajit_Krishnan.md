namaste,

  

Yesterday, we had a post on a nice new tool around the Apte dictionary. This reminded me to post about another set of sanskrit dictionary links.

  

<http://www.aupasana.com/software/kosha>

  

The link above hosts the "mudgala kosha" software, which searches an offline version of the monier-williams dictionary, and integrates with several online tools (DLI dictionaries, JNU declension engine, INRIA parser etc). It is a wrapper around many useful sanskrit web utilities. It is a windows-only application.

  

<http://www.aupasana.com/stardict>

  

Designed primarily for mobile devices, I have converted a number of files to the "stardict" dictionary format. This is supported on several platforms and mobile devices. The stardict files include bi-directional searchable files for the apte & monier-williams dictionary, as well as several vyAkaraNa related files (dhAtu-pATha, and several standard commentaries on the ashtAdhyAyii).

  

Screenshots on the iphone and android devices are available at the link above. Though these tools were written primarily for my own use, others may find them useful.

  

sasneham,



 ajit
