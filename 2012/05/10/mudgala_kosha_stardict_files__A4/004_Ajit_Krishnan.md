namaste,  
  
I guess that I am confused about the intent of your mail. If you are  
taking about some different software -- great. The more, the merrier.  
If you uploaded an older version of mudgala kosha, great. My site was  
down for a long time, and the software was not available from me for a  
while. If others made alternate arrangements, I have no concerns or  
problems with that.  
  
In the past, I always released my tools under the GPL. After some bad  
experiences, I no longer do so by default. But, at my discretion, I am  
happy to provide the sources to those that request it, so that they  
can improve upon it, or do something different with it. I don't really  
have any strong attachment to these small tools.  
  
sasneham,  
  
 ajit
