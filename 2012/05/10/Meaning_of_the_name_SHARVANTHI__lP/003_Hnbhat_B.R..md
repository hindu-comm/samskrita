परशक्त्या *स्रवन्ती* सा भूयात्कुंभी शिवाय मे।।४।। *स्  
रवन्ती* सा हतापाया पापहारिसरस्वती।।  
पुनातु सा ह्यवाग्वासा पापहन्त्री सरस्वती।।५।।  
  
The word *स्रवन्ती* *as a noun is synonym for the river along with others according to the Amarakosha.  
  
As an adjective, it is used with any noun names of rivers or anything flowing. This is the strict meaning for the word which is derived as a present participle from the verb sru - to flow. With expanded meaning, it can be used to mean anything one can imagine.Dictionaries will give more meanings if you search under sravat- stem.  
  
The other word asked for is least possible to be a correct sanskrit word, unless one tries hard to establish it to be one like the other thread had many attempts to prove kimaya to be sanskrit.
