A postscript.

  

Further, meaning is dependent on the language the word is used and unless the language in which the word is sought, nothing can be said precisely. Since our group is "samskrita" related group, the first occurs the language संस्कृत and everyone would be wishing to explain the meaning within their knowledge of it at first. But names need not have to be particular to any language and one can call by the name Dittha which need not have any meaning, but just to identify the person/thing from others by his/its name. Looking for the meaning of the names itself seems to be very interesting, if not absurd according to their aptitude towards it.

  

Thus chemmandhi poove means the flower known by that name in the language, which is a corrupt form of or related to the word सेवन्तिका - diminutive form of सेवन्ती which could be grammatically incorrect form derived from the root to serve सेवृ सेवायाम् which could not normally शतृ suffix like स्रवन्ती which is perfect. chemmandhi is common name for chutney also in the native languages Tamil or Malayalam. So trans-naming ceremony and inventing their meaning may result in curious findings.
