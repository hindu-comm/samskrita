Thanks Sri Nithyananda for the best suggestion. As for the names, from the verb शर्व root, the word itself gives the popular name of शर्व, शिव स्थाणु - meaning the destroyer God, whose feminine counterpart is known as शर्वाणी meaning the same as the name of the Goddess. than शर्वन्ती which also could be explained as such with any context as the present participle of the word as adjective or noun conventionally used as such रूढ word for the Goddess.  

With regards
