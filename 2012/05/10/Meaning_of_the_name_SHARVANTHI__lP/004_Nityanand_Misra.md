Dear Sh. Mohan  
  
What do you mean you typed it without error? You may have have typed it as the person spells it, but that does not mean it is without error. It is highly unlikely that the "i" at the end is the short vowel, and furthermore you have not specified if by TH you mean त् or थ्. So if one wants to say that they have typed it without error, they better type it in Devnagari or using some standard transliteration scheme like IAST.  
  
Coming to the meaning, what Ajit Mahodaya has explained is the meaning of the word *sravantī* (स्रवन्ती), which is formed from the root स्रु (स्रु गतौ, Dhatupaatha 22.42, भ्वादिगण परस्मैपदी meaning to flow, to spread or to move), as Dr. Bhat also pointed out. The suffix *śatṛ* is used in the sense of present participle, and the suffix *ṅīṣ* forms the feminine. Monier Williams gives several meanings for *sravantī* including streaming or flowing, a river and a herb.  
  
स्रु + शतृ + ङीष् = स्रवन्ती  
*sru + śatṛ + ṅīṣ = sravantī  
*  
*  
*If the name is *śarvantī* (शर्वन्ती), I differ with Dr. Bhat, it is a valid Samskrita form that can be formed from the root शर्व् (शर्व हिंसायाम्, Dhatupaatha 15.76, भ्वादिगण परस्मैपदी) which means "to injure/maim/kill). Radhakantadeb in *Śabdakalpadrumaḥ* cites Kavikalpadruma for a second meaning which is गतौ (meaning "to go or to move"), which is also listed by Apte. Like in case of the previous word, the suffix *śatṛ* is used in the sense of present participle, and the suffix *ṅīṣ* forms the feminine. The meaning then would be "one who kills or destroys", referring to goddess Durgā or Kālī, or in the sense of second meaning of moving, it could also mean "one who flows or moves about", or a river", just like in the case of स्रु गतौ.  
  
शर्व् + शतृ + ङीष् = शर्वन्ती  
śarv + śatṛ + ṅīṣ = śarvantī  
*  
*Thanks, Nityanand
