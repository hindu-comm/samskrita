Here is a message regarding ashta vikriti patha. The theory is simple algebraeic one and you should find it on the net if you search with proper wordings in different sequence.

Theory of chanting is one thing and to learn from a teacher practically is a different thing. If you think it is possible for you to chant the ashta vikruti patha knowing the theory itself by yourself, I have no objection. Please try if you like. Learning from a teacher, you will know theory by practice.

In the link above you will find different views about chanting the vikruti patha itself than the saMhitA pTha which is the prakRuti of the vikRuti- eightfold. It follows that after you learn the prakRuti pATha of any Veda (whether it be Yajurveda - shukla or kRuShNa, or Rigveda) would be the same excepting the modifications suggedsted in the prAtisgAkhya-s for their recital.  
  
This is what I guess from your title of the topic and the lines in the message. I have not any idea what you really want to know or learn.  
  
The Vikrithis are eight in number:  
  
jataa maalaa sikhaa rekhaa dhvajo dando ratho ghana :  
  
ashtau vikrtaya : proktaa ; kramapoorvaa maharshibhi :  
  
jataa, maalaa, sikhaa, rekhaa, dhvaja danda, ratha, ghana are names of the eight vikRuti-s. which should be learnt in order and ghana is the last standard of Vedic learning.  
  
  
Here is a brief introduction of recitation of Veda-s asappearing in the book "Pancarudra-Ghana" by Suresh Ghanapathi, which is available for purchase also with CD-s ecitation.

The above is just an Introduction. You will find detailed theory of recitation in the above method in the article by Suresh in the book itself.  
  
Right now I could not reproduce the relevant page.
