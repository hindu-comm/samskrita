learned group thanks by heart for the detailed reference.  
my intention and aim is clear.  
i want to chant the veda with all eight vikrutis.  
i have studued Shukla yajurveda samhita from my teacher but due to  
tight work schedule he were unable to teach me all the vikrutis and  
now a days i can not spare enough time to go to my teacher and most of  
time i am working on desktop so ..... i thought if i can learn the  
Ashta vikrutis through the group reference will help me to satisfy  
myself. that's it.  
thanks again for all the links provided by you all.  
regards,  
kamalesh pathak
