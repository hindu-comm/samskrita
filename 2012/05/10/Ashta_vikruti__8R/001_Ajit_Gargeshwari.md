One can listen to Shukla yajurveda recital from this link please click from pages 1-28  
  
<http://www.astrojyoti.com/shuklayajurvedamp3part1.htm>  
  
If one wants to know about the theory then one has to learn and study the Samhita ( either by reading the original text with a Bhashya or by reading translations a number of books are available). To further understand the theory of the Mantras one can read the six subjects of the Vedangas. Phonetics (Śikṣā), Ritual (Kalpa), Grammar (Vyākaraṇa), Etymology (Nirukta), Meter (Chandas), Astronomy (Jyotiṣa).
