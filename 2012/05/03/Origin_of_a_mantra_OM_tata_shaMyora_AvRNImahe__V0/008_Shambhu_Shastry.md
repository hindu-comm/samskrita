Read somewhere, referring to saayaNaachaarya: shaM is goodness or happiness (bliss) here and yoH is Bliss there (in the state of brahman or the anirvachaneeyam). Clearly, from the usage, shaM and yoH are two separate words in this shaanti mantra, so shaMyuH is not addressed here.  
  
shaM appears numerously in all the vedas - shaM cha me mayascha me, shaM no devIrabhishtaya aapo bhavantu, the entire shamvatI sooktam, etc. Scholars may elucidate further.
