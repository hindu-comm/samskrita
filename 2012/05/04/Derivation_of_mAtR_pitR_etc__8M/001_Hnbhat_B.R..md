In short there is no need to stick to the meanings of the verbal root for all the nouns though etymology can be given unless their derivatives are obviously used in the primary derivative senses.

  

There are similar forms derived from different roots and one cannot stick to all the meanings of the different words homonyms:

  

पातीति पिता whoever protects may become a father, which is not a true fact. Not all those protect one, can be the father of the person protected.

  

Please use commonsense in looking for derivations with etymology.
