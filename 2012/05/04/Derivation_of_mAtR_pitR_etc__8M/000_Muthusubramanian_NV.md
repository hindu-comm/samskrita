Hi all,  
  
The words कर्तृ, श्रोतृ, भोक्तृ, दातृ, धातृ etc are derived from the corresponding धातुs, कृ, श्रु, भुज्, etc and the meaning is one who does that particular action. (Eg: यः ददाति सः दाता, यः करोति सः कर्ता )  
  
Do the words मातृ, पितृ, भ्रातृ also fall under the same category or do they have a completely different derivation altogether? If the former, what are the corresponding roots for these?  
  
Would be helpful if some one can explain this.  
  
Thanks!
