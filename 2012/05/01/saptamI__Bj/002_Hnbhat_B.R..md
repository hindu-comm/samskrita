Post-script:

  

सत्, सन्, सती are the forms of the verb अस् which is common to be used with nouns, as the verb of existence, equal to English "to be" to make clear even if there is not any verb used with a noun. अयं गजः (अस्ति) and it is the same with the use of its locative usage as सति with a सप्तमी to make the intention clear. रामे वनं गते सीता तमन्वगच्छत् is clear enough. But only सति is added just like in the case of the first sentence and has nothing to do with सप्तमी grammatically and hence you may find any explanation for the use of सति सप्तमी in the Grammar books.
