Some additional tips sent by a friend:  

  

"...Both are available and read well. The list is still valid.  
Go to [http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in](http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/)  
Search for Astadhayayi Sutra Pata  
and click to see the book.  
Follow up with **Astadhyi (Bashya) Prathamavriti**  
  
Check through a few pages to find if you are up to it. Otherwise, links from <http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools> may be more useful .  
  
For some reason, automatic DLIdownloaders may or may not recognize the path for downloading.  
  
(Link for this and other already downloaded books is at <http://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks> )...."``







Regards,



sunder
