I assume that it is really "svArthasampAdane" and "viniyoktAro".  
  
There would be a difference in meaning between "parAn viniyoktAraH"  
and "pareSAM viniyoktAraH": According to Panini, the former is used in  
the meanings of "tat-shIla" tad-dharma" and "tat-sAdhukArin". So kaTAn  
kartA would refer to one who is naturally inclined to make mats, one  
who is duty-bound to make mats, or is very good at making mats.  
  
Turning to your sentence, I find it impossible to understand this  
sentence with either of the latter two meanings. The first is barely  
possible for me, but may be that is what was meant. In other words,  
the sentence is grammatically correct, but it is hard to understand  
what it is supposed to mean. What was the original English sentence  
anyway?  
  
\[BTW, this form, in Panini's language, was distinguished from the  
perphrastic future by the placement of the udAtta: kaTAn ka'rtA means  
"natural born mat maker", while kaTAn kartA' means " he will make  
mats".\]
