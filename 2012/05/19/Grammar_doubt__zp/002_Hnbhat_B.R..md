I agree with Rajagopalan. It is difficult to decide without knowing the intention of the user of the English Sentence if it is a really practical sentence used as a proverb or a random sentence intentionally created for translation without any such specific purpose in use.

  

Both could be grammatically correct with/without difference in meaning as it already accepted:

  

"विवक्षातः कारकाणि भवन्ति"

  

in Sanskrit Grammar.
