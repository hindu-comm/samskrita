Dear Sirs,

Thanks for your explanations. The quoted sentence is from  
J.Krishnamurthy's book, "the first and last freedom". A person is  
translating some of his talks into Sanskrit. I had doubt in that  
particular sentence.

For your informations I am giving the full pargraph in which the  
sentence appears. The context is someone asks Krishnaji what is  
simplicity?

He begins by replying like this "' Let us see what simplicity is not.  
Don't say-"that is negation" or "tell us something positive". That is  
immature, thoughtless reaction. Those people who offer you the  
'positive' are exploiters; they have something to give you which you  
want and through which they exploit you.""

The last sentence is the one which I posted as a query.

I hope this is clear enough.

Thanks for Nathji and Bhatji for their explanations.

Rajagopalan
