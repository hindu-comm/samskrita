Could it be

  

ये तावद्विधिरूपमुपदिशन्ति ते नूनं स्वार्थसंपादने परान् विनियोक्तारोभवन्ति।

  

'Those who offer the positive are indeed users (or exploiters) of others for their own selfish purpose.'

  

Apte does not give the verb 'to exploit' in his English-Sanskrit Dictionary. He has 'exploit' as a noun in the dense ofपराक्रम, अद्भुत कर्म. However, the well-known verse

अमन्त्रमक्षरं नास्ति नास्ति मूलमनौषधम्।  

अयोग्यः पुरुषो नास्ति योजकस्तत्र दुर्लभः॥

does use 'योजक' in the sense of 'one who uses/employs' others. 'Exploits' is an easy extension of the meaning from 'uses'
