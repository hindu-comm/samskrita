Dear All,

I have a doubt in Grammar.

I read a Sanskrit translation of an english sentence as follows:

ये तावत् विधिरूपमुपदिशन्ति ते नूनम् स्वार्थ्सम्पादने परान् विनियोक्तातो भवन्ति।

Now my question is whether the usage of "परान्" is right here. Should  
it be "परेषाम्" ? Are both usages correct? I vaguely remember once  
reading somewhere "कटम् कर्ता", meaning maker of mat. I don't  
remember where. In that case "परान्" should be correct? Is there a  
condition when or with which verb द्वितीया विभक्ति can be used, as  
used in the given example?
