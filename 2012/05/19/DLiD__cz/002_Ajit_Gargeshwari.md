This is their support page  
  

-   **DLID Toy** is an all Java reimplementation of DLID 0.23. It
    retains a minimal set of
    [features](http://dlidownloader.wordpress.com/faq-page-for-dli-downloader-0-2/DLID025),
    but can provide quick and convenient downloading from both IISc and
    IUCAA sites. It is available on OS X (10.3+) and on all platforms
    that have Java(1.5+), with WebStart enabled.

*Note: The User Manual discusses only DLID Complete. The FAQs and Support sites discuss all three versions.*

If you have any further question you can email dli.downloader@\][yahoo.com](http://yahoo.com)
