Please see the below link for Mac Toy downloader  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/dlidownloader/>  
  
Before downloading books from DLI site it might be a good idea to see if the links work from their site and then start using the down loader with Scan numbers. Sometimes the scan might have been removed or DLI site might be down.
