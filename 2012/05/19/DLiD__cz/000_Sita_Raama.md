Hello Everyone

I am using Mac Toy downloader and for many book it gives me this message

"Scan Not at DLi"

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/dlidownloader/Catalogue%202%20-%20IISc%20DLI%20Scan%20Availability.html>

However on the above link it shows "Scan Available" Message

  

here are few numbers

**1990020084629**

**99049990028158**
