Very helpful. I also heard that some names are HINDU NAMES but not  
100% SANSKRIT NAMES.  
The reasoning is that some books that list HINDU NAMES might list  
names inspired by words from the HINDI LANGUAGE, which is not 100%  
sanskrit.  
Do you know anything about this?  
  
Thanks Sir Kolhatkar -- really appreciate your reply and all the info  
posted.  
Peace,  
Geeta and Sudhanva Sharma
