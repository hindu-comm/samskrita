To Sudhanva,

  

I am not able to understand thedistinctionthat you are trying to draw between Hindu names, Sanskrit names and names inspired by the Hindi language.

  

Thephenomenon, as I see it, is that young parents - of Indian origin - wish to give a name to their young kid which is evocative of the Old India/Sanskrit tradition. They also wish, among other things, that the name should be 'novel', that is, not a conventional one. This is perfectly understandable and laudable. However, all such young parents may not have studied in depth the ancient literature of India or the Sanskrit language.

  

Such parents turn to 'name-suggesting' websites that have sprung up by the dozens, thanks to the internet. The creators of such sites themselves may not be more equipped to suggest suitable names than the users of their sites. These sites borrow from each other and, between themselves, produce a plethora of 'novel' names of doubtful provenance.
Such names, some of which are truly meaningless and even downright nonsensical, soon develop a momentum of their own and become standard.

  

(An example of the nonsensical is the girl's name 'Shleshma'श्लेष्मा.
Its meaning is 'nasal discharge or mucus'. Whoever gave this name to his daughter did not worry about its meaning. Enter this word in Google and you will meet dozens of girls who are carrying thisunfortunate name, oblivious to its meaning!)

  

Discussion along these lines may be seen under the thread 'Aarush' of June 10, 2011.

  

To Murthy,

  

Why invent the inelegant 'Kim ayaH', when a perfectlyunderstandableetymology of 'Kimaya' from the Arabic 'al-kimiya' is available?
