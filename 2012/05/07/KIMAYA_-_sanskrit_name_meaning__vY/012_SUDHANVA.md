Hello again Sir Kolhatkar,  
  
Thanks for your erudite response. Makes sense.  
  
Question -- my name is SUDHANVA. When I put that name in Monier-  
Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, it doesn't exist. But it appears in the  
Vishnu Sahasranamam.  
  
Also there are names of Gods and Goddesses which don't seem to appear  
in the online Sanskrit dictionaries.  
  
Is there a proper resource for finding Sanskrit words and names (such  
as other names for various Gods/Goddesses) online?  
  
And as to Mr. Murthy's point, we have been told that same thing by two  
priests in the NY Area.  
That KIMAYA originates from "kim ayaH"  
and that there is another name KEEMAYA which means MIRACLE.  
Again, I couldn't find this online hence our confusion.  
  
Thanks to all for helping us -- in fact, we are MORE interested in the  
meaning and it was when searching for words that meant DIVINE that we  
found KIMAYA.  

  
With appreciation,  
Geeta and Sudhanva
