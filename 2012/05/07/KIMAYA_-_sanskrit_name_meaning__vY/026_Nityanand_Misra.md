Dr. Bhat, what does Bhāg.1.47.17 refer to? Is it the Devībhāgavatam? For the first Skandha of Srīmadbhāgavatam has only 19 or so chapters (as per <http://bhagavata.org/canto1/c1-contents.html>).  
  
Also स्त्रियमकृत विरूपां स्त्रीजितः कामयाम् seems to be missing one syllable at the end - the 14 syllables sound like first 14 of Mālinī metre which has 15 syllables in the न न म य य Gaṇa order. There must be a metre with the न न म य ल ग but it is not commonly known.  
  
Thank, Nityanand
