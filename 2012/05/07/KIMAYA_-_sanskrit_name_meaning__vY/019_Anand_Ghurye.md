Dear Arvindji ,  
  
Here you are assuming that the name Shleshma is given by Indian parents. Shleshma is quite a common name among Gorkhas or Nepalees . I do not know the meaning . But trans language bloopers are many . Like for say there is Murkh tailor in Bangkok , or the problem Mr. Lodge faces in India , or similarly Mr. Mule when abroad or the reason I use my name with accentuation marks .  
  
Regards ,
