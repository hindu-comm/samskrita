Sudhanva,

  

To answer your queries *seriatim:*

*  
*

*\<*When I put that name in Monier-illiams Sanskrit Dictionary, it doesn't exist. But it appears in theVishnu Sahasranamam.*\>*

*  
*

Dr Bhat has already answered this. 'Sudhanva' is the first case singular of the m. noun 'Sudhanvan. The word does not appear in MW. It appears in Apte as one of the words with 'su' (meaning 'good') as the prefix. You will get it there if you scan through the long entry for 'su'. Both these learned lexicographers expect the user to have a level of basic knowledge. MW does not give the word as he presumes that the user can break the word down into its easily comprehended components that mean 'good' and 'bow' and work out the meaning from it. Apte is a little more helpful since he actually does the breaking, but the user still has to know where to look for the word in the dictionary.

  

\<Also there are names of Gods and Goddesses which don't seem to appearin the online Sanskrit dictionaries.>

  

The same answer. The user should have some idea as to where to look for the word. All such names do have meanings.

  

\<Is there a proper resource for finding Sanskrit words and names (suchas other names for various Gods/Goddesses) online?>

  

I do not think there is any unified resource like this. However, likeविष्णुसहस्रनामस्तोत्र, there areनामस्तोत्रs for other gods that you may look up. An informedacquaintance with epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, Indian mythology, classical Sanskrit literature is helpful.

  

\<we have been told that same thing by twopriests in the NY Area.That KIMAYA originates from "kim ayaH">

  

Ordinary priests are hardly an authoritative source for Sanskrit erudition. Many such, found in Western countries are 'Sunday warriors'.
In my opinion, even professional priests do not know much beyond what they have learned by rote. You only have to listen to their chants to judge for yourself how much out of what they chant they really understand.

  

to sum up, if you want to give the name 'Kimaya' to your to-be-born child, you may do so. It is not a bad name in itself. If you are looking for a modicum of 'Sanskritness' in it, then 'Kimaya' is not the name for you.
