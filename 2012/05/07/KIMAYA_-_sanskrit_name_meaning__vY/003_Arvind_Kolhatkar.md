I do not think that 'Kimaya' is a Sanskrit word. It is not found in Monier-Williams.

  

As to the Online Dictionaries (more correctly name-suggesting websites) - and the perils of relying them - there have been several discussions in this group, which please see.

  

Most probably Kimaya is a derivative of of the Arabic word for Chemistry, which also gives 'Alchemy'. (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy>)
