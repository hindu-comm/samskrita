1. Sudhanva does exist in Monier Williams under page 1225, you may want to first learn how to search Monier Williams in particular, and any Sanskrit dictionary in general. Many a time names are given under entry of the prefix as explained earlier.  
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1225-suduHzrava.jpg> - see the entries "-dhanva" and "-dhanvan" in middle column (these are under the word "Su").  
  
2. Please be specific, which names you did not find in which dictionary? Most likely it is because you did not search the right way.  
  
3. I don't see how kim + ayah may mean a miracle, does not sound correct. You should ask your priests the same question if you are very keen on a Sanskrit name. Can they cite its usage in some ancient work or in any old or new dictionary?  
  
4. Rather than Kimayaa, Kimaaya, Keemaya, and other variants, can you please spell the name in Devanagari instead of Latin characters.
