Whether among Hindi speaking families or families speaking other Indian languages, there are a lot of common Hindu names that are not pure Sanskrit - they are either Tadbhava (तद्भव) forms of Sanskrit words (like Bimal in Hindi-speaking regions from Vimala, Karsandas in Gujarat from Kṛṣṇadāsa, Manogaran in Tamil Nadu from Manoahara, etc) or are what you call Deśaja (देशज) names like Munnelal in Hindi-speaking regions, Chiman/Chimanbhai in Gujarat, Basava in Karnataka, or Senthil in Tamil Nadu. More people are now shifting to pure Sanskrit names, especially in urban regions, and some are even adopting names from foreign languages, not to forget embellishing with the extra E, K or A for numerological reasons.
