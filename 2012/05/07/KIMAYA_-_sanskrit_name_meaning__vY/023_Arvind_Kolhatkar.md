Sudhanva,

  

If by KAMAYA you mean कामया,then it is the instrumental case (तृतीया विभक्ति in the language of grammar as taught in schools) of कामा (will).
कामया means 'atwill' or 'by will' as inकामयाब्रूहि '(you may) speak at will'. कामया is not a stand-alone noun and, in my view, is not appropriate as a name.
