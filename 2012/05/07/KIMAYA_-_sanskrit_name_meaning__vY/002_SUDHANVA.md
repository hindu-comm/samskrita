Namaskaar Dr. Hari Narayana,  
  
Thanks for your prompt reply. That has been the problem. Some online  
dictionaries list it as a Sanskrit name meaning DIVINE. And yet,  
others do not. Also we consulted with four priests in the New York  
area -- each having a different idea of this name.  
  
For example, the name SUDHANVA is a Sanskrit name that is NOT listed  
in some Sanskrit dictionaries though we know it is.  
  
And we also know that in certain communities (Marathi and Gujarati)  
the name KIMAYA is given to girls. But again, as we are more  
interested in SANSKRIT NAMES, we just want to check with you all. If  
anyone else has thoughts on this, please advise. We would be most  
thankful.  
  
Peace from New York,  
Geeta and Sudhanva Sharma
