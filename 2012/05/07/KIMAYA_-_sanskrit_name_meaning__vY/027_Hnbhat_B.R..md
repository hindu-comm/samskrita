Thanks for pointing out the error. It was the error in the text entered in the dictionary itself online Apte: which was meant for the example of कामयाना in the feminine gender. But of the quoted source, no idea :

It is quoted in another source completely as following:

  

मृगयुरिव कपीन्द्रं विव्यधे लुब्धधर्मा

स्त्रियमकृत विरूपां स्त्रीजितः कामयानाम् ।

बलिमपि बलिमत्त्वावेष्टयद् ध्वाङ्क्षवद्य-

स्तदलमसितसख्यैर्दुस्त्यजस्तत्कथार्थः ॥

  

as I had noted in the last line to my previous message. The text was quoted in a document named गौरगोविन्दार्चनापद्धतिः seemingly a चैतन्य cult text. It is found in उज्जवलनीलमणि also of रूपगोस्वामी. Now the meter is also perfectly मालिनी. It seems to be mistaken in the reference in the Bhagavata text also as I found it in another page as 10.47.7 which seems to be the perfect source asBhāg.1.47.17 as in the [vedabase.net](http://vedabase.net) also.

  

Thanks for the correction. Of the other abbreviations also no idea as they have not given the full form for the abbreviations of the quoted works.
