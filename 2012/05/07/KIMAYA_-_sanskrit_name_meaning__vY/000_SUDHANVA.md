Namaskaar Samskrita folks,  
  
We have been in email touch with you but were advised to post this  
request to this group.  
  
Is the name KIMAYA a Hindu Sanskrit name?  
What is the meaning of the name KIMAYA?  
  
We researched it and found it means DIVINE. However there are a few  
that doubt this is a SANSKRIT NAME. We need clarification as we are  
expecting our first baby and want to be sure before we select this as  
a possible girl's name.  
  
Thank you for your help with this.  
With appreciation,  
Geeta and Sudhanva Sharma
