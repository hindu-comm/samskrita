Dear Smt and Sh Sharma  
  
Can you be more specific please? Which online dictionary lists it as a Sanskrit name? If it is one of the numerous name meaning sites, it may not be reliable and it would be better to consult some standard print or online Sanskrit dictionaries. Neither किमय/किमया nor किमाय/किमाया are listed in M Monier Williams', V S Apte's or Radhakant Dev Bahadur's dictionaries.  
  
As far as Sudhanvaa is concerned, it is a very common Sanskrit word and it exists in most Sanskrit dictionaries. Sudhanvaa (सुधन्वा) is the nominative singular form of the base (प्रातिपादिक) Sudhanvan (सुधन्वन्). So in a Sanskrit dictionary you will find it under "Sudhanvan". Most Sanskrit dictionaries list the word, including Monier Williams and Apte (Apte lists it under the "Su" entry as **-dhanvan** or **धन्वन्**).  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
