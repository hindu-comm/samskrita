***Namaste  
I am studying Sanskrit for a lot of years knowing that I am slow in learning languages but my love for this sacred language and literature has the one that moves me forward with great intensity. All I try to discover by myself, with your so great support, all your e-mails and books I read, and this because I try to leave you free from my doubts, but I am always with and among you. It is good, in this years, how all you have advanced; to see your success. It is in fact a Blessing.  
My doubt goes in this attachment with the symbol of the letter that I am looking for. I know I saw it many years ago but now, re-reading the Siddhanta Kaumudi, this appears again, at the really beginning, and I don't remember: if is a simple and ancient letter or a compound one and how is in fact pronunciated.  
Independently of your answer I want to deep thank you all and show my proud to be among you.
