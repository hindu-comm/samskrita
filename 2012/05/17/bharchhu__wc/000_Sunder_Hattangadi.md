In a commentary on Lakshmidahra-kavi's Advaita Makaranda, the following appears:



puruShAparAdhamalinA dhiShaNA niravadyachakShurudayApi yathA \|

na phalAya ***bhR^iShTaviShayA*** bhavati shrutisambhavApi tu tathAtmani dhIH \|\|



In another version the word ***bhR^iShTaviShayA*** has a pAThabheda (variant)

***bharchhuviShayA*** and ***bhartsuviShayA.***

****

I would greatly appreciate any explanation of the above verse. Thank you.





Regards,
