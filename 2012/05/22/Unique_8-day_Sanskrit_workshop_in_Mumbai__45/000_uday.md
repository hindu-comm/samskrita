"It was a great experience. The sessions were really intense and organised. This workshop would definitely help me to explore Sanskrit literature further…I highly appreciate the research work Dr. Mishra has done for this workshop and the learning material he has prepared for participants…"

"I must say, as hard as it is to find a good teacher, it is harder to leave once you have found one. For years I had been searching for a true and devoted Sanskrit guru and now I am glad that I have found one in Sampad. One could feel his passion for this beautiful, ancient language. Ancient it may be but archaic it is certainly not. Given time, I am sure I could be proficient in Sanskrit under the guidance of Sampad..."
