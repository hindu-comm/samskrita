Hello Everyone,

I have a littleAsTAdhyAyi - Sutra Patha book published by Chaukhabha
SuraBharati publications. Written by Gopaaladatta pAdeyaH

  

1.  **वृद्धि**रादैच ३ 2.  अदे**ङ्गु**ण: ३ 3.  **इको गुण वृद्धि ३** 4.  न धातु-लोप आर्ध-धातुके ६ 5.  etc 6.  दीधी-वेविटाम्

  11**. इदूदेद** द्विवचनं **प्रगृह्यम्** १२,१९

I was wondering if anyone in the group has same book and if they know anything about the number thats given in front of सूत्र, and the meaning of bold letters. Some sutras do not have any numbers as in 6th.

Only part of the sutra is highlighted, I am trying to see if they want to tell how far adhikarasutra goes etc but could not come to a conclusive understanding because first two sutras are SanGyA sturas.

  

I would really appreciate your help

Raama
