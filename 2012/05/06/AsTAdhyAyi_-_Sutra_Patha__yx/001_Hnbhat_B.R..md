You have to look in introduction for instructions how to use the book. The numbers at the right may refer to the numbers the सूत्र-s are quoted in the edition of सिद्धान्तकौमुदी he has referred. If he has said it as अधिकारसूत्र it may be. But it may be the extent up to the सूत्र follows and only at after it, next number will appear if it is to be taken in the following sUtra-s. It is called अनुवृत्ति and not अधिकार as you have suggested. It simply suggests the word/words have to be taken from this in the following सूत्र-s up to the sUtra starts a new topic. There may or may not be अनुवृत्ति of any सूत्र depending on the need of the syntactical requirement for the formation of the rules which can be usually understood by their order and the topic dealt with. This is provided by the वृत्ति-s generally and their commentaries.

  

Anyhow, I do not have the edition and you have to look in the introduction for the hints for using the book. The above is what it appeared from the portion you have quoted.
