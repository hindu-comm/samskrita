Sri Raama,  
  
I have the book that you have mentioned. The explanation for the usage of bold letters is given in the "bhUmikA" section in Hindi by SrI gopAlaSAstrI darSanakeSarI . As Sri Bhat mentions, these represent anuvRtti - it means that if a pada "x" is given in bold in a sUtra along with a number "n" at the end of it, then the pada x can be used to form the meaning of any subsequent sUtra till the sUtra numbered "n".How the meaning of a sUtra has to be formed is explained beautifully by SrI gopAlaSAstrI darSanakeSarI in the "pUrvapIThikA" section (again in Hindi).  
  
Please note that there are also sometimes numbers with parenthesis (1),(2) etc at the end of sUtra-s. These are meant as aids for memory - you find these numbers at the end of every 20 sUtras. For example, in the first adhyAya, first pAda, the (1) marker will be at the 20th sUtra "dAdhA ghvadAp", the (2) marker will be at the 40th sUtra "ktvA-tosun-kasunaH" etc. At the end of a pAda, the first pada-s of the 1st,21st,41st,61st.. sUtra's will be recited - e.g for the first pAda of the first adhyAya, you will find "vRddhir-Adyantavad-avyayIbhAvaH-pratyayasyaluk-pancadaSa", where pancadaSa indicates the last 15 sUtra-s of the first pAda.  
  
Regards,  
Shyam
