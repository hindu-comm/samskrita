"The introduction is written in Sanskrit and my Sanskrit reading comprehension is not good."  
  
I remember my teacher who used to say, if one wants to read and understand and go into the depths of AsTAdhyAyi or Mahabhashya ones level of classical Sanskrit should be good enough to read those books in original Sanskrit a short cut may not help. Understanding correctly and properly AsTAdhyAyi is not meant for all. Ideally must be studied with a teachers or guides help who should be competent to teach the same.  
  
I am not an expert but that my opinion.
