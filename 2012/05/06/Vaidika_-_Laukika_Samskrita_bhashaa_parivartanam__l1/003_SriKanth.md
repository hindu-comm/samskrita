Dear Hnbhat ji,  
  
I came across this piece of information about Vaidika - Laukika bhasha  
in a book called "संस्कृत - व्याकरणशास्त्रेतिहासविमर्श:" by Sri  
Ashokachandra Gaur Shastri., published by Bharatiya Vidya Sansthan,  
Varanasi. I find this book explaining about the Samskrit language and  
grammarians etc in a lucid Sanskrit which I find easy and intriguing  
to read with my little Samskrit knowledge. I am not gifted with a Guru  
in person so far, hence only through these books I come to know about  
Acharya Annambhatta, Acharya Bhattoji Dikshita etc.  
  
Before reading this book, I have not come across any book or article  
that gave some basic information about how the Vedic bhasha differs  
from Laukika bhasha.  
  
I have just been learning Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi and to cross this to  
Siddhanta Kaumudi itself looks like years away. I may not even reach  
the end of Siddhanta Kaumudi in this life time, yet at times when  
information like this gets tossed at the front portion of a book,  
kindles the curiosity like fire to take a look ahead; hence I inquired  
here.  
  
Thanks,  
Srikanth.
