First you have to learn basic Classical Sanskrit Language from सिद्धान्तकौमुदी or its primer editions सिद्धान्तकौमुदी। Then you will enter at the end of the all the topics come across the वैदिकप्रकरण in सिद्धान्तकौमुदी itself. That is how you can cover all of the differences between भाषा and वैदिक छन्दस्.

  

The other way is you can browse through the अष्टाध्यायी and its commentaries where you find the rules where the rules deviate from those for normal लौकिकभाषा.

  

You can search by Google if there is such an article or book yourself if you want just to know whether there is any such article of publication. Depends on your intention and its intensity of knowing the difference only. There may be articles published online in blogs which is less likely as many are interested in लौकिकभाषा and still less are satisfied with translations either in English or any readable languages.
