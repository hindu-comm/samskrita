Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has this dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Sakalya:



<http://www.celextel.org/108upanishads/brihadaranyaka.html?page=3>

III-ix-1: Then Vidagdha, the son of Sakala, asked him.  
‘How many gods are there, Yajnavalkya ?’ Yajnavalkya  
decided it through this (group of Mantras known as) Nivid (saying),  
‘As many as are indicated in the Nivid of the Visvadevas –  
three hundred and three, and three thousand and three’.  
‘Very well’, said Sakalya, ‘how many gods exactly are there,  
Yajnavalkya ?’ ‘Thirty-three’. ‘Very well’, said the other,  
‘how many gods exactly are there, Yajnavalkya ?’ ‘six’.  
‘Very well’, said Sakalya, ‘how many gods exactly are there,  
Yajnavalkya ?’ ‘Three’. ‘Very well’, said the other,  
‘how many gods exactly are there, Yajnavalkya ?’ ‘Two’.  
‘Very well’, said Sakalya, ‘how many gods exactly are there,  
Yajnavalkya ?’ ‘One and a half’. ‘Very well’, said Sakalya,  
‘how many gods exactly are there, Yajnavalkya ?’ ‘One’.  
‘Very well’, said Sakalya, ‘which are those three hundred  
and three and three thousand and three ?’  
III-ix-2: Yajnavalkya said, ‘these are but the manifestation of them,  
but there are only thirty-three gods.’ ‘Which are those thirty-three ?’  
‘The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras and the twelve Adityas –  
these are thirty-one and Indra and Prajapati make up the thirty-three’.



The implication is that any word other than 'One' is metaphorical, and 'sahasra'

indicates infinite, just as in Gita 11:12 the divine brilliance is compared to a``thousand suns.
