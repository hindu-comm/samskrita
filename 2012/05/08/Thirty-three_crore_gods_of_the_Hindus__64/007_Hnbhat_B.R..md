I could not understand the attempt the meaning of every word to Vedic Usages to be authentic. The meaning of Vedic Vocabulary is related to Vedic passages only. The Comparative method attaches the meaning with the parallel passages to the words in Vedic Literature while tradition attaches the meaning following Nirukta school.

  

Now coming to the instances cited, he cited only to specific usages from literary texts and not from any गणित texts for the use of कोटि in which he has the meaning crore or शतलक्षसंख्या. Now coming to the question of त्रयस्त्रिंशत् कोटिः for the देवता-s NUMBER, confused for meaning numeral word कोटि for the word

  

He now asked Yajnavalkya, ‘Yajnavalkya, are you indeed the best Vedic scholar among us ?’

Yajnavalkya replied, ‘I bow to the best Vedic scholar, I just want the cows’.

  

The above line is the guide line before any attempt to solve the riddle. The above conversation is between the Royal Scholar Asvala and the sage Yajnavalkya (the greatest of the philosophers who contributed to Shatapatha, and Brihadaranyaka). We can see the humbleness of Yajnavalkya and the royal voice of the interrogator.

  

This being pointed out, I just attempt to have look at the problem with my limited knowledge. As the above passage has the possibility of the variable of numbers from one to one crore which is explained by the short expression in English "manifestation". Note it is the English translation and not the original word from the text.

  

As the statements in Vedic corpus are concerned, they could be explained away as "meaningless statements" and "self-contradictory" as put by Yaska, the extant commentary of the Vocabulary of Vedic corpus,"अनर्थका हि मन्त्राः १,१५" "अथ अपि विप्रतिषिद्धार्था भवन्ति १,१५ः \`\` एक एव रुद्रो अवतस्थे न द्वितीयः \`\` असङ्ख्याता सहस्राणि ये रुद्रा अधि भूम्याम् " and dismiss them as meaningless. On the other hand, we can reconcile them along with the traditional commentators after Yaska.

  

In the same way, the statements in Brihadaranyaka and Shatapatha have two different views to be reconciled. Otherwise, the same with the Upanishad-s also happen; there are mutually contradictory statements :

  

which once says सदेव सोम्य इदमग्र आसीत् .... and again the same poses
*असद्वा*इदमग्र्म आसीत् ततो वै सदजायत तदात्मान हुम स्वयमकुरुत तस्मात् तत सुकृतं उच्च्यते इति

  

Now coming to the confusion about the word कोटि. It is used as numeral in mathematics and geometrical apex point in geometry. The second is literally used to refer to the highest point or supreme position in any field or group which could be interpreted as superiority. Now it is not seen used as adjective as guessed by the writer of the article to be interpreted as "The wordकोटि should be interpreted as 'supreme, preeminent, excellent'. Here is the extract of the entry in MW:

  

[TABLE]

  

as can be seen in

  

यदा यदापरां कोटिम्अभ्यारोहति यौवनम् / वल्गन्ति सरसाः कामास् तदा नाशाय केवलम् // योगवासिष्ठ//

  

This is the position those who follow the dictionary and Classical Sanskrit for understanding the Vedic Passages. I cannot comment anything on the interpretation otherwise. But I have seen the basic गणदेवता are 33 which are grouped as named in the शतपथ. which later has become enlarged at the time अमरकोश listed them:

  
( १. १. १९) आदित्यविश्ववसवस्तुषिताभास्वरानिलाः॥ 

१. १. २०)महाराजिकसाध्याश्च रुद्राश्च गणदेवताः॥

  

of which only three are enumerated आदित्य (१२) वसु(८) रुद्र (११) plus द्यावापृथिवी (२) = ३३

  

पुराण-s enumerate the remaining groups of देव-s.

  

"आदित्या विश्ववसवस्तुषिता भास्वरानिलाः।  
महाराजिकसाध्याश्च रुद्राश्च गणदेवताः॥"

  
आदित्या द्वादश प्रोक्ता विश्वेदेवा दश स्मृताः।  
वसवश्चाष्टसंख्याताः षट्त्रिंशत् तुषिता मताः॥  
आभास्वराश्चतुः षष्टिर्वाताः पञ्चाशदूनकाः।  
महाराजिकनामानो द्वे शते चापि विंशतिः॥  
साध्या द्वादश विख्याता रुद्राश्चैकादश स्मृताः।  
एते च संहता देवास्तत्रादित्याः स्वनामतः॥" इति जटाधरः  

  

Anyhow, there is एकदेवतावाद and also अनेकदेवतावाद both variant views accepted in निरुक्त of यास्क who explains them.

  

अयुतं प्रयुतं चैव शङ्कुं पद्मं तथार्बुदम्।

खर्वं शङ्खं निखर्वं च महापद्मं च*कोटयः*।। 2-88-3a 2-88-3b.

मध्यं चैव परार्धं च सपरं चात्र पण्यताम्। एतन्मम धनं

  

The numerals listed for betting in the gambling. The exaggerated expression indicated by the word कोटि as in:

  

सेवार्थमागतास्तत्र ब्राह्माणी ब्रह्मकोटयः ।।  
लक्ष्मीनारायणानां च कोटयः समुपागताः ।  
गौरीकोटिसमेतानाम् रुद्राणां मपि कोटयः ।।  
मन्त्रिणीदण्डिनीमुख्याः सेवार्थ याः समागताः ।  
शक्तयो विविधाकारास्तासां संख्या न विद्यते ।।

  

Arvind asked for the association of त्रयस्त्रिंशत् wth the wordकोटयः or कोटि in usage confused for crore the numeral. and no where in the article or any messages in reply it was not taken up. Only this can give guess for the confusion theory and not the existence of confused usage. Even the confusion could be with the superior state and not the adjective superior was meant for the word as claimed to be the real meaning in the article for which also no usage is found on a general search.

  

This is message is just in view of Aravindji's recent message. Otherwise, much has been said about the article in different messages and the different meanings from vedabase data has been offered recently from the Vedic usages for the वर्ड कोटि.

  

Thanks for all who contributed to the discussion of the topic.
