Dear Group,

  

I came across a paper at<http://www.namami.org/kriti%20rakshana_7vol/11/pdf/final%20newsletter.pdf>that suggests that originally there were 33 gods (8वसु, 11 रुद्र, 12 आदित्य, 2 द्यावापृथिवी,total 33.) In support is citedशतपथ ब्राह्मण ४.५.७.२.

  

I traced शतपथ ब्राह्मण ४.५.७.२ at<http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/2_bra/satapath/sb_04_u.htm>, where the text is in the Roman script asaṣṭau vasavaḥ \| ekādaśa rudrā dvādaśādityā ime eva dyāvāpṛthivī trayastriṃśyautrayastriṃśadvai devāḥ

  

I transliterate it in DevanAgarI as  

अष्टौ वसव:। एकादश रुद्रा द्वादशादित्या इमे एव द्यावापृथिवी त्रयस्त्रिंश्यौ त्रयस्त्रिंशद्वै देवा:...



(The concept of 33 gods is also shared by the Avesta.)

  

The paper goes on to suggest that the misinterpretation of the wordकोटि to mean 'a crore' has led to the idea of 33 crore gods. The wordकोटि should be interpreted as 'supreme, preeminent, excellent'. This, indeed, is one of the senses attached to this word in MW. The paper suggests that I-Tsing and Tibetan masters who translated Buddhists texts till the 8th century used this meaning for the wordकोटि. At some stage thereafter this meaning was forgotten andकोटि became 'a crore'. leading to 33 crore gods of the Hindus.

  

I request scholars here to comment on this interpretation.
