Thanks for your comments, yes it requires proof reading. I did not do it year but I will do as I progress with my studies of Kaumudi and correct the mistakes I find along the way.

yes the red numbers are siddhantakaumudi.

The links do not work because the workbook part of the document is missing and as I wrote earlier as well this is the index of the workbook, thats how the hyper links came.
