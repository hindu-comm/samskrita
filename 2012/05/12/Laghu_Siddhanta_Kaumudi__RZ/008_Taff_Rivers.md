where the various formats available for downloadingare listed to the right.



The.pdf there, downloads without any problem.



Those interestedshould perhaps be made aware, of twothings:



-   The 'pdf' is notthe text as one would expect, unless specifically
    told otherwise, butis disappointingly onlyscannedpages of same,
    something which does not lend itself toeasy extracts fortaking
    notes.

  

-   It is entirely in Devanagari, which restricts its usefulness
    somewhat.





Hope this helps.
