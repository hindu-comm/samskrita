Shri Sita Raama Mohadaya  
  
Thanks for this, it is useful as a quick reference even if one does not print it. However at a first glance it does require some serious proofreading for mistakes of spellings and compounds. E.g. लघु सिद्धान्त कौमुदि should be लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी. उपदेशेऽ न्त्यं should be उपदेशेऽन्त्यं.  
  
Are the red numbers the index of the Sutras in Siddhantakaumudi?  
  
The links in the PDF do not work, I do not know why you have them there.  
  
Can you also please share the LaTeX source for the document, if you don't mind.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
