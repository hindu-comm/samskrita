Namaste,

I saw few scanned copies of laghu, so thought of creating a book with sutra and its vrutti. I am not sure if this is of any help but just posted it on archives.

here is the link

<http://ia601208.us.archive.org/2/items/LaghuSiddhantaKaumudi/Laghu_Siddhanta_Kaumudi.pdf>

  

What different numbers mean is shown on the last page.

I was working on creating a workbook for LSK - this is index of that book. The work book contains sutra, its vrutti, padachcheda, space to write meaning and notes about each sutra and space for examples. it turns out to be 700 page document. then realized people can not print such large book.

  

regards

Raama
