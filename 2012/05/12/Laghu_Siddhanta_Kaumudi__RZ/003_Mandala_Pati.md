I started to study LSK (in English) along with three my friends. We understood that we need exercises with answers. It will help a lot. Because without practice it will be difficult to keep whole material. If You have exercises (sandhi, supanta-prakarana and so on), please share. If You know any book with such exercises, please give the name of the book.  
  
Thanks You.
