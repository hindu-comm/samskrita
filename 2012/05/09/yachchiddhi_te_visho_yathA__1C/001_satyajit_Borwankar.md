Dear Sirs,



further to my earlier mail,

following meaning was obtained by me elsewhere, which is at variance with Griffith which I have copied, hence the request for help.



Thanking you once again,

Satyajit



Oh Varuna, just as the subjects, (in this world), ignore their duties similarly we may, every day, demean the acts meant to please you, (by our ignorance or conceit) Please pardon us for that.  
Oh Varuna, to annihilate the one who dis-honours you, do not direct your anger at us, and with terrible anger do not hate us.  
Oh Varuna, just as the Lord of the chariot takes care of the tired horses (by feeding them etc.), similarly we try to please your mind by (appropriate) hymns.  
Oh Varuna, just as the birds return to their nests, similarly, my intellectual faculties which were endowed with anger (and ill feelings) when they went out of my mind, may they return to my heart for a prosperous life  
Oh Varuna, when shall we have you in actions leading to our happiness, you who are the strength personified, who are powerful, who knows everything, and who is known by the name Varuna.
