Better yourself learn Vedic Grammar from European Grammarians of Sanskrit or Traditional Grammarians of India like सिद्धान्तकौमुदी and try yourself splitting the words. Or please be content with the translations so that the time and effort of other members can be saved.

  

Or you can refer to any commentary of Sayana, Skandasvamin or Dayananda if available online or otherwise.

  

This is my sincere opinion and not intended to discourage your attempts.
