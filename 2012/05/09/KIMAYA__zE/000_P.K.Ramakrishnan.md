I recollect this incident which took place some 60 years ago. There was a swami who engages one inhumor. This

is as he narrated to me.

  

His younger sister who became a mother of a son approached him to suggest a name for her son. Her one condition

was that the name should end in "sh". He suggested MAHESH, RAMESH, DHANESH, VISWESH and so on. The

lady contented that those were very popular and wanted something new.

  

Then the Swami suggested that she could choose from any of the following - IDIKKESH, KUTHESH, MUTTESH,

MERATTESH, or KOLLESH.

  

The swami did not mention what finally happened to his suggestion.
