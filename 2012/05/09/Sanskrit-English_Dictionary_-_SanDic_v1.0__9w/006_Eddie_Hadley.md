Guys,



The instructions are in the small print.



Just beneath the large green “Download” box you can will see some blue text “*Browse All Files*”.



That is the link to the directory with the database file.

But read the README.txt there, first.



Download the *sandic_w32s.exe*.

Download the db - [*sandic.zip*](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/sandic.zip/download "Click to download sandic.zip").



You won’t, need [*Sandic_v1.0.zip*](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/SanDic_v1.0.zip/download "Click to download SanDic_v1.0.zip"), as its only the source code.



Unzip, and place the extracted db file in the same directory as the exe.



Run the exe.

It does take a while to load, but it does get there.



Regards,

 Eddie
