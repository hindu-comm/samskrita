****You must go to*** ***<http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/>*** ***and download SANDIC:ZIP,*** ***[README.txt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/README.txt/download "Click to download README.txt"), [SanDic_v1.0.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/SanDic_v1.0.zip/download "Click to download SanDic_v1.0.zip"), [SanDic_v1.0.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/SanDic_v1.0.zip/download "Click to download SanDic_v1.0.zip"), [sandic_w32s.exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic/files/sandic_w32s.exe/download "Click to download sandic_w32s.exe")  
After to unzip put the folders and the exe in one new folder and after click in the exe and all will begin working but take a little time to appear the dictionary. It is not a program of installation, each time you will open the dictionary you must click in the w32s.exe.  
When you unzip is normal that you will get two w32.exe but one comes, I think, in the file readme.txt that instead of you get the readme, you get another .exe. Is a repeated for to be deleted.
