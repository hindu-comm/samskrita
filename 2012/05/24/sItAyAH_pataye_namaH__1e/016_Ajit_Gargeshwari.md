E karanta pullinga it always PRONOUNCED AS  पतये , HARAYE  
  

I have never heard पत्ये pronounced as पतये unless one doesnot know the word or its usage in classical sanskrit. It has been clearly shown in this thread that as per Panini grammar used in classical literature पत्ये is correct. The word सीतापतये as a compound word is correct. One can justify पतये if you consider puranas do use archaic words and vedic usages and is allowed in Panini's grammar though not used.  
  
I don't know about the verses metrical accuracy.
