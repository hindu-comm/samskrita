I think आर्ष प्रयोग and अपाणिनीय प्रयोग are different sets though they overlap. आर्ष means used by the Rishis or used in Vedas but it need not be incorrect as per Panini, for Panini's grammar is a system for both Vedic and Laukika grammar. In fact Panini has himself used the word अनार्ष in the sense of Laukika Samskrita in the following Sutra  
  
सम्बुद्धौ शाकल्यस्येतावनार्षे  
  
If आर्ष means अपाणिनीय, then the above Sutra would mean "In the system of Panini, in the opinion of Sakalya, .... " which would be redundant since this is the grammar of Panini.  
  
आर्ष प्रयोग may or may not be पाणिनीय प्रयोग. क्षेत्रस्य पतिना, दिशां च पतये, सीतायाः पतये नमः are both आर्ष (Vedic) प्रयोग as well as पाणिनीय प्रयोग. Some आर्ष प्रयोग may not be पाणिनीय प्रयोग though they might have confirmed to the eight old grammar systems which preceded Panini's system.
