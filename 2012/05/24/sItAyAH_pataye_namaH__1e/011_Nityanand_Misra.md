Dr. Bhat, I think you are partly correct and partly incorrect.  
  
You are right in saying that सीतायाः पतये नमः is not an instance of अलुक्समास since the अधिकारक्षेत्र of अलुक्समास does not cover this case. षष्ठ्या आक्रोशे (6.3.20), ऋतो विद्यायोनिसम्बन्धेभ्यः (6.3.22) and विभाषा स्वसृपत्योः (6.3.23) are the relevant Sutras here and there being an absence of गम्यमान आक्रोश, and ऋकारान्तत्व, an अलुक्समास is not possible. Thanks for correcting me.  
  
However, I don't agree when you say that क्षेत्रस्य पतिना वयम् (and similarly सीतायाः पतये नमः, which I will come to in a bit) is incorrect. Immediately following शेषो घ्यसखि (1.4.7) and पतिः समास एव (1.4.8) is the Sutra  
  
षष्ठीयुक्तश्छन्दसि वा \[पतिः घि\] (1.4.9)  
  
"In the context of *Veda*s, *pati* (पति) when combined with a word ending in the genitive case optionally gets the *ghi* (घि) nomenclature." (Translation is mine, and is far from perfect).  
  
1. क्षेत्रस्य पतिना (तैत्तेरीय संहिता 1.1.14.2) being Vedic is correct, where पति gets the optional घि संज्ञा  
2. दिशां च पतये (माध्यन्दिन संहिता 16.17) being Vedic is correct, where पति gets the optional घि संज्ञा  
3. Two examples where पति does not get the घि संज्ञा (when combined with a word in the genitive) in Vedas are कुलुञ्चानां पत्ये (माध्यन्दिन संहिता 16.22), पत्ये विश्वस्य भूमनः (17.78)  
  
Now coming to original question about सीतायाः पतये नमः - by the rule षष्ठीयुक्तश्छन्दसि वा (1.4.9), it is correct Vedic usage, an example of छान्दस पाणिनीय प्रयोग and is definitely not an अपानिणीय प्रयोग. For more details on both क्षेत्रस्य पतिना and सीतायाः पतये नमः, one may refer the चन्द्रलेखा commentary on अष्टाध्यायी by पण्डित ईश्वरचन्द्र (Chaukhambha Surbharati Prakashan, Varanasi, 2004).  
  
Remember that by tradition, the श्रीरामरक्षास्तोत्रम् was instructed in a dream by शिव to विश्वामित्र (बुधकौशिक) - as the Stotra itself says (Rāmarakṣāstotram verse 15)  
  
आदिष्टवान्यथा स्वप्ने रामरक्षामिमां हरः  
तथा लिखितवान्प्रातः प्रबुद्धो बुधकौशिकः  
  
"Just as Śiva instructed this Rāmarakṣā in \[his\] dream, the arisen Budhakau sika wrote in the morning.\[15\]" (My translation from [here](http://sites.google.com/site/nmisra/raamaraksaastotra.pdf), again far from perfect).  
  
Hence the Rāmarakṣāstotram is believed to be Apauruṣeya, especially in the Rāmānanda Sampradāya. Being an Apauruṣeya or in other words "Alaukika" work revealed to a Mantradraṣṭā (just as the Vedas were revealed), a Vedic or Alaukika usage is not surprising.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
