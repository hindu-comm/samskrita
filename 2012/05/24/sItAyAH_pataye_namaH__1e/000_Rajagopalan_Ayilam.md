namaste,  
  
I have a doubt in the following verse  
  
  
रामाय रामभद्राय रामचन्द्राय वेधसे ।  
रघुनाथाय नाथाय सीतायाः पतये नमः।।  
  
in the above sloka सीतायाः पतये is wrong. It should be सीतापतये or सीतायाः पत्ये  
About this a discussion is done in Samskrita Bharati's book Shuddhi Koumudi. But I am not satisfied with the explanations given there. In fact some more similar examples are given in the book.  
  
I would like to know the opinion of experts of this group.  
  
PS:- I don't know whether a discussion on this has happened before. If so, could anyone point me to the link.  
  
  
Regards
