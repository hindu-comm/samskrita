Poets are well known for composing in meter and still being grammatically correct. The composer of this particular verse would have used a 'filler' to complete the meter had he / she chosen to useसीतायाःपत्येorसीतापतये.  

  

This meter aspect is only incidental, and not a reason or justification for the usage ofसीतायाः पतये \|

  

An observation.
