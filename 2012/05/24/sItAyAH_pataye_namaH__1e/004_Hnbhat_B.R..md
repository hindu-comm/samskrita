I don't think you memory is correct. Because the word पति and सखि are dissimilar with other masculine words ending in "i" and still they are given their declension as special words.

  

The technical problem I have already explained in my post. You can refer to any list of declensions of words online for the declension of the above two words. In other words, the word पति is declined like other words only in compound as it is specially mentioned in a rule "पतिः समास एव" and only words like भूपति and other compounds formed as तत्पुरुष are declined like other words ending in इ and excludes the usage of isolated word पति like them for derivation process.
