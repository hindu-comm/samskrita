Respected sir  
As i discussed with my guru  
सीतायाः पतये is correct because as you count the line (रामाय  
रामभद्राय रामचन्द्राय वेधसे) it contains 16 letters  
the next line(रघुनाथाय नाथाय सीतायाः पतये नमः) should also contain 16  
letters according to CHANDASSU and other vyakarana factors.  
सीतापतये is also correct but not suited here becase it counts 5  
letters  
पत्ये will not come becase E karanta pullinga it always PRONOUNCED  
AS पतये , HARAYE
