I agree with Nityananda. It is not only definition of आर्ष given by Apte that would explain all the usages. आर्षप्रयोग is very popular in usage as :

  

आर्षं धर्मोपदेशं च वेदशास्त्राविरोधिना।

यस्तर्केणानुसन्धत्ते स धर्मं वेद नेतरः॥ (मनुस्मृतिः १२/१०६)

  

which has been explained as ऋषिप्रणीतम् धर्मोपदेशं - which does not not include only Veda, and शास्त्र, but any teaching taught by the sages. आर्ष refers to one of the 8 varieties of विवाह also as per याज्ञवल्क्य.

  

The आर्ष in the case of usages other than Veda-s also like धर्मशास्त्र, स्मृति etc.  
and need not necessarily mean अपाणिनीय. In the case of Veda-s mostly Panini uses "छन्दसि बहुलम्" and many times explains the deviation.
