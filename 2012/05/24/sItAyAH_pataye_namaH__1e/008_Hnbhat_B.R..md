Not any compound, but तत्पुरुष compound only. Therefore, in बहुव्रीहि it is differently declined as in isolation. So, परमश्चासौ सखा - परमसखः -परमस, परमः सखा यस्य सः - परमसखा, परमसखायौ - परमसखायः।

and also declined like कवि परमसखिना, परमसखये, परमसखेः, etc.

  

So It is only in तत्पुरुष and कर्मधारय सखि takes ending अ and not in other compounds and in different compounds, it takes different declensions in certain cases.
