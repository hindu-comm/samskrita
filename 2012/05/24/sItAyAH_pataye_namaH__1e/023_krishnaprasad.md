I saw this dispute long back but not in the net, among my friends,  
some of my friends said, this sloka comes in PadmaPurana So this is  
Arsha Prayoga but some said it is not found in padmapurana,  
Also  
शशिनीव हिमार्तानां धर्मार्तानां रवाविव \|  
मनो न रमते स्त्रीणां जराजीर्णेन्द्रिये पतौ \|\|  
here पतौ is called arsha prayoga, i don't know the original author of  
this sloka but it comes in Hitopadesa 5th story 110 sloka
