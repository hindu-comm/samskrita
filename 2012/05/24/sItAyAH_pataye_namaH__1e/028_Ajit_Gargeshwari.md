आर्षः प्रयोगः is a term for usages which are not correct as per Panini, are still considered valid on account of these words having been used by rishis. Literally, word Arsha has following derivation: ऋषेरिदम् (अण्). Its meaning as per Apte's Dictionary is: Used by a rishi only, relating to or belonging to sages, archaic, Vedic (opp. लौकिक or classical). In all probability these usages were existent before Panini composed his grammatical rules.  
  
So if one searches the Puranas or ancient Smriti texts one can find several such आर्ष usages and may also find usages which are not is Paninian Grammar but are used by other Grammatical schools. Whenever such usages are found commentators and experts go at length either to defend the usage or censure such usages.
