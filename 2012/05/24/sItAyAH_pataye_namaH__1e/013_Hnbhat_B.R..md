Thanks for bringing to my notice this rule. It is enough if Panini says both forms are valid due to the optional application of the preceding rule in आर्ष usages in the case of used with षष्ठी.

  

With the argument of being आर्ष all the archaic usages like पतौ, पतये etc. could be justified as quoted in स्मृति texts and पुराण-s as many of the स्तोत्र-s are taught by one or other ऋषि-s, at least by वेदव्यास himself as the author of the पुराण-s.

  

Only the point is, in spite of these usages, it is better for us to follow Panini's rulings for our daily usage in our writings. This is my sincere opinion.
