Namaste  
  
This comes somewhat late, but hopefully not too late. A seven-day discourse series on Gopīgītam (Śrīmadbhāgavatam 10.31.1-19) by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya is currently underway in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. The discourses are primarily in Hindi with portions in Samskrita, and include musical rendition of the Kanakamañjarī verses, investigation of each word with multiple Paninian interpretations and detailed exposition with Pramāṇas from commentaries on Śrīmadbhāgavatam, lexicographers, grammar, and other scriptures and texts.  
  
For those interested, the discourses are being telecast live on Sanskar TV from 4 PM to 7 PM India time. Today was the third day and the Guru has so far covered from the first verse (*jayati te'dhikaṃ ...* *dhṛtāsavastvāṃ vicinvate* 10.31.1) till the eighth verse (*madhurayā girā ...* *pyāyayasva naḥ* 10.31.8). The remaining nine verses will be covered over the next four days.  
  
*yacchṛṇvan vipaṭhan vicāraṇaparo bhaktyā vimucyate naraḥ

Thanks, Nityananad
