Kalpa Heritage Trust is organising a 2-day National Seminar on SHULBA SUTRAS at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bangalore on the 1st and 2nd of September 2012. As you are aware, Shulba Sutras are part of Kalpa Sutras and deal with specifications for the construction of Vedic Sacrificial Chitis(Altars). Specifications are drawn based on the use of Shulba(String) to arrive at different shapes such as Rhombus,Garuda,Kurma etc. It is believed that the Sutrakaras had comprehended the principles of the Pythagoras theorem, the value of Pi and approximations of Root of 2, conversion of square to rectangle,circle etc.

  

There are eight Shulba Sutras presently extant namely, Apastamba, Baudhayana, Hiranyakesi, Manava, Varaha, Maitrayaniya, Vadhula and Katyayana.Varaha and Vadhula are in manuscript form while the rest are in the print form.  

The trust invites traditional scholars as well as academicians/research scholars to present papers on various aspects of Shulba Sutras..Mathematicians with knowledge of the Sutras are welcome to participate to interact with traditional scholars. Vidwan Venkatesh Avadhani of Mathur who helped conduct Paundarika Soma Yaga as per Apastamba Shulba Sutras at Vijayawada recently has consented to participate and elaborate on the moulding of bricks, construction of the Chaina Chiti and the conduct of the Yaga.In order to provide sufficient time to each scholar, the number of presentations will be limited to eight. There will be a key note address by an eminent scholar.

  

Last date for receipt of papers being presented is 31st July 2012.

This is the second seminar being conducted by Kalpa Heritage Trust after the successful organisation of a National Seminar on Vivaha Samskara at Mysore in October 2011.

Looking forward to responses from scholars,

With best regards,

Dr.V.R.Anil Kumar
