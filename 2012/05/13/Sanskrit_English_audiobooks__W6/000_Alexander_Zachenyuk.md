Namaste everyone. Do u know where i can get scriptures with sanskrit and english audio. My sanskrit is not good enough to understand plain sanskrit without translation but if its sanskrit audio then english audio translation and in this way the whole book is read that would help a lot. It may be any scripture written in sanskrit . DhanyavadaH in advance .
