I have heard that the first mantra of rigveda can be pronounced in two ways -

  

१. अग्निमीडे पुरोहितम्

२. अग्निमीळे पुरोहितम्

  

What about Kalidasa?

  

Though it is written कालिदास it is pronounced as काळिदास

  

There is a place in Calcutta (Kolkatta)

called Kalighat where there is temple for

Kali. It is pronounced by everyone including

Bengalees as काळिघट्ट. It is not in South India.

  

I have heard long ago ड ळ योरभेद: /

  

Bengalees always pronounce व as ब.
