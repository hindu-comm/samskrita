This topic has already been discussed please our group archives. The question is not how one pronounces how it should be pronounced. Many English words a pronounced by different non native speakers differently but that doesn't mean it is correct. So when one teaches rhymes to young children it is important to tech them the phonetics as laid down in phonetic books so that that they can accurately learn how to pronounce.
