\>\> Many English words a pronounced by different non native speakers differently but that doesn't mean it is correct  
  

English is probably a not useful defence in this context. Which English phonetics (or spelling) is correct? The American, Australian, British? Even if one tries to get the phonetics right, the accent skews the phonetics.
