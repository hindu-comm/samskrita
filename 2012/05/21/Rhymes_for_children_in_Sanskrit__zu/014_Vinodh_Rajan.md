What am I trying to say is:



There is an established convention of the usage of ळ inclassical Sanskrit as used in Tamil Nadu. (I presume the same for other parts of South India )



Words like नामावळी are quite common in traditional Sanskrit books printed inTamil Nadu (using theGrantha Script). Even Sanskrit printed in Tamil Script makes use of the retroflex l.



It may not conform to \*strict\* Grammatical rules, but that said its a convention that has been in vogue for long. And it cannot be just brushed aside as \*improper\* Sanskrit.
