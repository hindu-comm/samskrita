I think I can add an very old rhyme:

  

का त्वं बाले काञ्चनमाला. कस्याः पुत्रि कनकलतायाः।

हस्ते किं ते तालिपत्रम्.*कावा रेखा*क ख ग घ ।।२।।  
  

This had been developed in such a way to include all the alphabets in the अक्षरमाला by सुधर्मा daily:

  

<http://sudharma.epapertoday.com/2010/02/02/2796/>

  

This has been completed with this old verse as the second.

  

This one also old one has got one more more parody:

  

जम्बू फलानि पक्वानि*पतन्ति विमले जले*। कपिकम्पितशाखाभ्यः गुलुगुगुलुगुग्गुलु॥

jambū phalāni pakvāni patanti vimale jale\| kapikampitaśākhābhyaḥ guluguguluguggulu\|\|

  

which runs as follows:

  
The poet says:  
जम्बुफलानि पक्वानि  
पतन्ति विमले जले \|  
तानि मत्स्या न खादन्ति  
जालगोलकशंकया \|\|  
  
The scientist says:  
जम्बुफलानि पक्वानि  
पतन्ति विमले जले \|  
तानि मत्स्या न खादन्ति  
निर्मत्स्यजलकारणात् \|\|  

  

and one more suggestion by Jaideep Joshi:

in his comments. But not much of rhyme as in the original verse.

  

Though these two might have been included in the links already posted, just I was reminded of these two verses I had learnt in my younger days.
