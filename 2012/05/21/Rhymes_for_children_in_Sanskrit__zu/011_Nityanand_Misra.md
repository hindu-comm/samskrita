Apologies, but there is nothing called South Indian Samskrita and North/East/West Indian Samskrita, it's only Paninian Samskrita. Samskrita does not have dialects, Prakrits do. Classical Samskrita and Paninian grammar do not have the retroflex ळ neither do the standard dictionaries. We have had several threads on this in the past on this group which discussed how this consonant is present only in some Rigvedic प्रातिशाख्यs and absent from other Vedic literature and also from classical Samskrita.
