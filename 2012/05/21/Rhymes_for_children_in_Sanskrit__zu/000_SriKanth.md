sabhAyai nama:  
  
I am wondering if there is any web page having a collection of rhymes  
in Sanskrit for children.  
  
I have put in some here:  
  
<http://www.sangatham.com/simple-sanskrit/sanskrit-rhymes/aksharamala>  
<http://www.sangatham.com/simple-sanskrit/sanskrit-rhymes/rajiv-unusual-dream>  
<http://www.sangatham.com/simple-sanskrit/sanskrit-rhymes/lets-fly-in-airplane>  
<http://www.sangatham.com/simple-sanskrit/sanskrit-rhymes/lalana-geetam>  
  
I am sure there must be many more but not easily available in  
internet.  
  
I thought of posting this query in the Amarchitra katha thread, but  
did not want to sidetrack there hence separate email.  
  
dhanyavada  
Srikanth.
