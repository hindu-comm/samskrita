Namaste Cynthia  
  
This is a very valid feedback.  
I would give this suggestion to the distributors so that there is  
always a "bundled with English version" option for buying a Samskritam  
comics book.  
This idea works irrespective of whether the book is purchased from a  
book store or from the online store.  
Thank you for this idea  
  
Regards,  
Venkatraman U
