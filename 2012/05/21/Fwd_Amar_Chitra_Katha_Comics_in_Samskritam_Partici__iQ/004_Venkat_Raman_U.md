Namaste  
  
I have just joined this Google group.  
I am the one who has put up the Amar Chitra Katha Samskritam readership survey. The number of responses we've got till now is 324.  
This is quite encouraging given the fact that its just 1.5 weeks since it was put up.  
  
But we have a long way to go and so please encourage everyone in your Sanskrit circles to take up the survey.  
This group has 298 members, and it would help if everyone here takes up the survey.  
We'll wait for some more time before we meet Amar Chitra Katha again so that we get a better survey response count by then.  
  
Thank you Sai for posting the survey link in this forum.  
  
In the survey, many supporters have indicated interest to participate in the translation work.  
So, we're setting up a detailed process with which all of us can collaborate effectively to translate as many comic titles as possible into Samskritam. With this process we aim to enable beginners to experts to contribute as much as they want/can to the volunteered translation work. We've been doing this translation as a group for 2 years and it has been such an exciting and fun thing to do, and also the result is very valuable. We'll send more details to the mailing list formed out of the email ids collected in the survey.  
  
धन्यवादः  
Venkatraman U
