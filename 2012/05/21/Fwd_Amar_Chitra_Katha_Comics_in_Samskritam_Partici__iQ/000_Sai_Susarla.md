Samskrita Bharati Ulsoor, Bangalore folks have been doing a great work, namely, translating Amar Chitra Katha's Ramayana into Samskritam.  
  
They've been posting it in a website periodically, e.g., page 49:  
<http://sites.google.com/site/ramayanasanskrit/page49>  
  
It's really cool.  
  
For Amar Chitra Katha Publications to do it in a bigger way, they need to do a readership survey.  
Here it is:

Please click on the survey and fill it to show your support for this awesome effort by Samskrita Bharati.
