Dear sanskRuta Lovers,  
 namaskaara.  
 I am very happy to learn that Amar Chitra Katha Comics are being published in sanskRuta text in devanaagaree Script.  
 I can support this activity by the way of Purchase of a number of such books and didtribute them as Presents/Gifts to High School Children who have taken SanskRuta as the First, Second or Third Language Option.  
  
** How many Titles are already Printed and available in a Place like Bangalore (and in which Book Shop) and  
  what is the Price of each such book,  
 will be a relevant information useful for Supporters & Well Wishers like me.**  
  
 With regards and Best Wishes to all of you especially in your Volunteering Activity of Translation of English and other Amar Chitra Katha Titles in sanskRuta_devanaagaree Versions,  
 Dr. Ghare, Wednesday, 30th May 2012, Seattle USA
