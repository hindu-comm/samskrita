The above is the extract from the वाचस्पत्यकोश.

  

The text is from Act I.36/37 from the dialogue of विट. There is a corresponding word as कणेरा in Monier williams.Here is the word explained in Apte's Dictionary:

  

  
f.{ii-stem}  
  
[1.an](http://1.an) unchaste or faithless woman;  
  
[2.an](http://2.an) unmarried woman

  

Hope this will be helpful in understanding the meaning.
