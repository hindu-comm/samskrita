Hi all,  
  
I was reading the text मृच्छकटिकम् and came across the word काणेलीमातृ and came to know that it means a bastard. It means that one whose mother is a काणेली which probably means a prostitute or courtesan. But [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) or monier williams dictionary doesn't have काणेली as an entry. Can any one explain what is the origin of this word?
