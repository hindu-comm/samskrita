This is apart from the discussion on the correctness of सीताया: पतये नम: .

  

I have heard in a kathaakalakshepam by the well known Anantharama Dikshitar theexplanation of why these different names are used denoting one person i.e. Srirama.

  

रामाय रामभद्राय रामचन्द्राय वॆधसे /

रघुनाथाय नाथाय सीताया: पतये नम: //

  

रामाय -  his mother Kausalya calls him Rama.

रामभद्राय - other members of his family call him Ramabhadra.

रामचन्द्राय - his friends call him Ramachandra.

वेधसे -  Vasishtha calls him as Vedhas knowing him as the incarnation of Vishnu.

रघुनाथाय - People of Ayodhya who remember Raghu calls him Raghunatha.

नाथाय -  Sita calls him Natha.

सीताया: पतये - People in Mithila, Sita's birth place, call him as the husband of Sita.

नम: - applicable to all the names.
