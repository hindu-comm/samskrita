It will be directly the quiver where the arrows sit. इषवः आसते अत्र - इष्वासः ।

  

but अस् क्षेपणे = to throw, shoot here. "हलश्च" इति करणे घञ् संज्ञायाम्। अत्र इषवः अस्यन्ते अनेन - the weapon used for shooting arrows, which cannot be none other than the bow as already recognized by the lexicographers and the commentators and in usage it is the word denoting the bow and nothing else.

  

आसनम् आसः - it can be seat, chair or any furniture to sit derived from आस उपवेशने। At the best it can be used also for the quiver in which the arrows are seated. But the equipment to shoot arrows could be only the bow.

  

There is another root also.

  

अष गति-दीप्त्यादानेषु - असन्ति इषवः अस्मात् - the equipment from which arrows shoot themselves or are taken. The same घञ् can give both the meanings either quiver or bow.

  

Only one has to takeinto considerationthe conventional meaning in which a word is used for giving etymology and not all the verbs that make up the stem.
