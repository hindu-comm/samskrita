Gentlemen,



Quote

English translation  
That \[instrument\] by which arrows (इषुs) are thrown (shot) are called इष्वास (meaning a bow). Those whose bows are great are called महेष्वासाः.  

End quote



That English translation simply says that anyone who has a top quality bow is a great archer.

No practice or skill required!

Like the bow must be bit special, magic bow, perhaps?



But I rather think something is lost in the translation there.



I am not sure of the internal saṃdhi of maheṣvāsa

but wouldn’t maheṣu + iṣv-āsa separate out as maheṣ + vi + ṣv-āsa

or is my maheṣu at fault.



Anyway, translation wise, *maheṣvāsa* is a “great archer“



maheṣvāsa

 • m. a great archer, MBh. (also -tama), R.

 • N. of Śiva, Śivag. \[802,2\]



And even इष्वास means an archer, so no bows, magic or need come into the frame.



iṣv-āsa

 • mfn. throwing arrows.

 • m. a bow.

 • an archer.

 • a warrior, AV. xv, 5, 1, 7, MBh. R. &c. \[169,1\]



So, the sloka from Bhagavad Gita, (1.4)

  
Atra sura Maheshwasa Bhimarjuna Samayudi\|  
Yuyudhano virata: cha Drupada: cha Maha rathaa:\|\|  

then becomes, as it is rendered in English by Juan Mascaro in the Penguin Classic of 1962:



 Here can we see heroic warriors, *powerful archers*, as great as Bhima and Arjuna in battle:

 Yuyudhana and Virata and king Drupada of the great chariot of war.
