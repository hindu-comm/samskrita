Dear Sh. Radha Krishnan  
  
Did you refer any of the standard translations or commentaries of Gita which give the अन्वय and the meaning? There are several such resources online, including this one  
  
<http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-01-04.html>  
  
Anyway, coming to the term, it is a बहुव्रीहि compound meaning "those with great (महा) bows (इष्वास)".  
  
इषवो बाणा अस्यन्ते क्षिप्यन्तेऽनेनेति इष्वासः. महान्तः इष्वासाः येषां ते महेष्वासाः  
  
English translation  
That \[instrument\] by which arrows (इषुs) are thrown (shot) are called इष्वास (meaning a bow). Those whose bows are great are called महेष्वासाः.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
