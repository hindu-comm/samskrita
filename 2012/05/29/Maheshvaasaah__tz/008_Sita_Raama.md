Its a बहुव्रीहि समास (Bahu Vrihi samasa) which is anya pada pradhanya (Something different than the described object).

In Maheshwasa the bow is not important, its the holder of the bow is important. They can attribute any amount of magic to the bow but still after the samasa its the person that matters. Since its the person who isdescribed then lot of practice and a good reputation is required to earn this title.
