Multiple interpretations are possible. "Those with great bows" (mahāntaḥ iṣvāsāḥ yeṣāṃ te) is the meaning in several old and new traditional Sanskrit commentaries as Ajit Ji has pointed out. This can mean both "archers having great bows" and "great archers". It is similar to the case where **mahāmanas** (having a great mind), **mahāyaśas** (having a great fame), **mahātman** (great Self), **mahāśaya** (having a great disposition) are all used for a "great or noble person". Part for whole and whole for part, it is called transferred epithet in English.  
  
Below are four possible meanings or **iṣvāsa**I can think, and with these four meanings we parse the compound **maheṣvāsāḥ** in four different ways. As you are averse to Devnagari, I will use IAST throughout. This is just a glimpse of what all is possible in the magical world of Samskrita, and a Guru can derive and parse terms like these in hundreds of ways. Hope this will satisfy you.  
  
***Meaning One*  
**  
The most common meaning of iṣvāsaḥ is the bow as listed in the Amarakośa which Sh. Kolhatkar has also pointed out (Kṣatravargaḥ, verse 83).  
dhanuścāpau dhanvaśarāsanakodaṇḍakārmukam  
**iṣvāso**'pyatha karṇasya kālapṛṣṭhaṃ śarāsanam **  
**The derivation is **iṣavaḥ asyante anena iti** **iṣvāsaḥ**. With this the meaning, **maheṣvāsāḥ** is parsed as a **bahuvrīhi** compound - **mahāntaḥ iṣvāsāḥ yeṣāṃ te maheṣvāsāḥ**, literally "those with great bows". "Those with great bows" can mean "those with magical bows" (not necessarily with great skill) or "those with bows that are difficult to break or cut or stop" (with great skill) as mahāmanas, et cetera, above, can also mean "great man"  
**  
*Meaning Two***   
  
As you rightly pointed out, iṣvāsaḥ can also mean the archer using the same derivation as above. The Hemakośa says **iṣvāso dhanvadhanvinoḥ**, meaning the word can be used for both the bows and the archers. If this meaning of iṣvāsaḥ is taken, then the word **maheṣvāsāḥ** will be parsed as a **samānādhikaraṇa tatpuruṣa** (**karmadhāraya**) compound - **mahāntaḥ ca ime iṣvāsāḥ ca iti maheṣvāsāḥ -** meaning "great archers". Of course great archers have "great bows" since there skill makes it difficult for their opponents to break or cut their bow into two.  
  
***Meaning Three***  
  
iṣvāsam also means, in the neuter gender, the act of throwing or shooting arrows as Monier Williams confirms. **iṣūṇāṃ āsamiti iṣvāsam** as the **ṣaṣṭhī tatpuruṣa** compound. If this meaning is taken,
**maheṣvāsāḥ** will again be a **bahuvrīhi** compound - **mahānti iṣvāsāni yeṣāṃ te maheṣvāsāḥ** (note now mahantaḥ becomes mahānti and iṣvāsāḥ becomes iṣvāsāni in neuter gender). This would mean "those whose act of shooting arrows (archery skill) is great". In this interpretation, there is no doubt that it it the skill which is great. Again if skill of shooting arrows is great, they are also "great archers" and their "bows are great" since due to their skill, opponents find it difficult to break or cut their bows.  
  
***Meaning Four  
***  
In Samskrita the word **āsāḥ** can also mean a bow. This is confirmed by Kirātārjunīyam 15.5 - **sa sāsiḥ sāsusūḥ sāso** where **sāsaḥ** means "with a bow". The derivation of **sāsāḥ** by Mallinath is given as **asyante kṣipyante śarā anenetyāsau dhanuḥ akartari ca kārake saṃjñāyām** **iti ghañ āsena saha vartata iti sāsaḥ sacāpaḥ***.* Now that **āsāḥ** means bow and **iṣu** means arrow, there can be a **dvandva compound** between the two - **iṣavaśca āsaśca teṣāmitaretaradvandvaḥ iṣvāsāḥ** - then **iṣvāsāḥ** means a collection of arrows and bow. Then again the compound **maheṣvāsāḥ** will be a **bahuvrīhi** with the same vigraha as in meaning one - **mahāntaḥ iṣvāsāḥ yeṣāṃ te maheṣvāsāḥ** meaning "those whose arrows and bow are great", so they have great arrows and great bows. They have great arrows if the arrows are divine/magical (not necessarily with great skill), or if the arrows always hit their targets (with great skill). They have great bows if the bows are divine/magical (not necessarily with great skill), or if the arrows always hit their targets (with great skill).  
  
So you see, a compound can be interpreted in many ways as long as it makes the correct sense. What I gave below is the primary vigraha and derivation in commentaries, but other vigraha and derivations are also possible.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
