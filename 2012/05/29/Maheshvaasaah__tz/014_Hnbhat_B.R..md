Too much of discussion has gone on the compound अत्र शूरा महेश्वासाः भीमार्जुनसमा युधि। with wrangling with literal meaning than literal meaning of इष्वास and महेश्वास being agreed by all the commentators equivocally बहुव्रीहि and in the context it suits very well.

  

I can't understand the whole exercise of Seetha Rama splitting bit by bit the great archers into pieces in the light of dictionaries and etymology.
