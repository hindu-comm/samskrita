Mahāmanas Nityanand,



It is interesting to note that the English ‘archer’ is derived from ‘arc’.

Arc as a verb. *To arc* is to move in a curve suggestive of an arc.



And remarkably, the same with **dhanus**, where the ‘arc’ is the noun.



dhanus

• n. (m. g. ardharcādi; cf. dhanu) a bow, ṚV. &c. &c.

• a measure of length = 4 Hastas or 1/2000 Gavyūti, Mn. Yājñ. &c.

• (geom.) an arc or part of a circle.



Regards,



Eddie
