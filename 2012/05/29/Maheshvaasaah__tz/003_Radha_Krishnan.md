Dear Sri Nityanand-ji,

\> इषवो बाणा अस्यन्ते क्षिप्यन्तेऽनेनेति इष्वासः. महान्तः इष्वासाः येषां ते  
\> महेष्वासाः  
\>  
\> English translation  
\> That \[instrument\] by which arrows (इषुs) are thrown (shot) are called इष्वास  
\> (meaning a bow). Those whose bows are great are called महेष्वासाः.

Thank you very much for the explanation. iShwaasaH means bow. and  
maheShwaasaH means the person who is holding great bows. This  
difference I could not appreciate and hence I asked the question.  
Now, It is clear. It is bahuvreehi samasa.

With regards,  
Radhakrishnan.
