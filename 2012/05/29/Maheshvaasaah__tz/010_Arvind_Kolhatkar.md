Dear Group,

  

One could also treatमहेष्वासा: as a qualifier forशूरा: in which caseअत्र शूरा: महेष्वासा: could be rendered as 'here are brave (warriors) who carry large bows.

  

Also, couldइष्वास be rendered as the 'seat of the arrow', suggested from अमरकोष 2.8.84.2 इष्वासोऽप्यथ कर्णस्य कालपृष्टं शरासनम्?

  

(This verse also tells us that, just as Arjuna's bow was named 'गाण्डीव', Karna's was named कालपृष्ट, a detail that at least I was not aware of!)
