I attach an excel sheet giving the calculation of the total strength of men, horses and elephants in 18 akShauhiNIs that fought on both sides.
I have presumed that each chariot needs two horses and each elephant and each chariot will need two men - one to drive and the other to fight and, on this assumption, calculated the total number of men, horses and elephants in 18 akShauhiNIs. 

  

This gives in all 3,93,660 elephants, 3,93,660 chariots, 11,80,980 horse riders, 19,68,300 foot soldiers, 47,23,920 total men and
19,68,300 total horses.

  

This creates several difficulties in visualizing whether the numbers can be real. We know the tremendous amount of time and staff-work involved in gathering such enormous numbers of men and animals at a given time in a short space, arranging for the food for men and animals and a myriad other requirements that necessarily follow as a sequel of a war. Even with modern means of communications and transportation this will be well-nigh impossible. Added to this consideration is also the fact that India of 3000 and odd years ago was not as populous as it today is.

  

I would think that when MahAbhArat went on expanding over centuries and underwent embellishments, someone gave a free rein to his imagination and put in these exaggerated and unreal numbers, which have caught the imagination of the trusting believers, just as 33 crore gods did.

  

The propensity of old Indian writers to weave in ever-expanding tables of numbers in their writings - witnessed in Manu's scale of time, division and subdivision of small quantities of time, classification and subclassification of Alankaras in Alankarashastra to cite a few examples - appears to be the cause for the 18 akShauhiNIs of MahAbhArata.
