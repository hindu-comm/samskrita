I agree it is a vartika and not a sutra.  
  
Panini, Arthsastra, Ramayana, Amara the concept Akshauhini is not clear. But a vartika hints at the word Akshauhini.  
  
Panini knew the four fold division of army. There is a grammatical rule saying that the names of army-divisions when compounded take singular number, ex a combination of charioteers and horsemen was called rathikasvaroham; and the former and foot-soldiers asthikapadatam. The compounds must have had their origin from the prescribed grouping of these different units for the purpose of military operations.  
  
Panini knows of a Bharata and Mahabharata and refers to three principal characters, Vasudeva, Arjuna (IV.3.98) and Yuddhisthira (VII.3.95)  
  
Now lets see Mahabharata  
  
The Army was divided into Patti, Senamukha, Gulma, Gana, Vahini, Pratana, Camu Ankini and Aksauhini. Patti meant one chariot, one elephant, three horses and three footmen. The next was senamukha, the four arms of the patti multiplied by three. In this way one can arrive at the figure of for Aksauhini as 21,870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 65,610 horses and 1,09,350 foot-soldiers.  
  
In the udyogaparva there is a different enumeration of the army units. There is a mention of sena, prtna and Vahini. Sena consists of 500 chariots, 500 elephants, 1500 horses, and 2,500 foot-men. Ten senas constituted a pratna and ten pratna one vahini (Udyoga 155, 22-24)  
  
In Adi Parva there is a different enumeration of the army units.

If we consider, akshauhiNi, anikini and chamu to be one and the same then the army size comes to:  
  

|                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | |--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 1 chamu / anikini / akshauhini | = 729 chariots; 729 elephants; 3,645 soldiers; 2,187 horses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | | Paandav army (7 akshauhini)    | = 5,103 chariots; 5,103 elephants; 25,515 soldiers; 15309 horses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | | Kaurav army (11 akshauhini)    | = 8,019 chariots; 8,019 elephants; 40,095 soldiers; 24,057 horses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | | Total (18 akshauhini)          | would have about 170,000 people. (including 2 people per chariot, 3 people per elephant, and 1 rider per horse). Considering another 1000 people per akshauhini as support staff; there were about 180,000 people in Kurukeshtra. Considering that about 5% of the force was killed in the war, about 9,000 people must have been killed in the war. |

  
These figures seem realistic. Many kings had sent 1 akshauhini force to help the Pandav / Kaurav. Kings of Sindh / Punjab / Bengal / Gujarat sending an infantary of about 3,000 is a possibility that can be considered. (As against 10,000 infantry.)  

  
Details of how many people were killed in the war is not clearly mentioned in the Mahabharata epic. Please see

From this it is clear that the constituents of an Akshauhini is not an exaggeration and might have been possible.  
  

Please note  
  
The historicity of the Kurukshetra War is unclear. There have been a number of theories put forward

I agree with rest of the information Dr. Bhat and Arvindji have provided.
