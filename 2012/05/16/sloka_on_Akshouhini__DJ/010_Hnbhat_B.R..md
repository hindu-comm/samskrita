I don't think Panini had mentioned this word anywhere in his अष्टाध्यायी text.

  

It appears only once in a वार्तिक to the best of my knowledge, as "अक्षादूहिन्यामुपसंख्यानम्" which extends the operation of वृद्धि between अक्ष+ऊहिनी, resulting in the form अक्षौहिणी which otherwise would be अक्षोहिणी by the normal rules operating in this case under the सूत्र[६।१।८६](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/6.1.86)

of अष्टाध्यायीand here it has nothing to do with its meaning whether it means a unit of army with a fixed number as described in the Mahabharata text and other texts or meant as a general term used for the army which is not a mandatory condition for the grammatical operation "sandhi" in this word.

  

Please provide reference if you have met the occurrence by Panini mentioning the meaning. I could not find in the whole text of अष्टाध्यायी on a search in the document containing the text.

And I am not sure about the other texts using this term to mean a generic term for army. Amara lists some of the names in the genereic names:

  

ध्वजिनी वाहिनी सेनापृतनानीकिनी चमूः।  
वरूथिनी बलं सैन्यं चक्रं चानीकमस्त्रियाम् ।।२-८-७८।



before proceeding the deployment of the force:

  

व्यूहस्तु बलविन्यासः - which forms the part of अक्ष+ऊहिनी - ऊह which makes it the distinct number consisting of 10 units of अनीकिनी which is again as it can be seen is included in the generic words used for the military force in general along with two others highlighted above. By his time the term was not used as the generic term to denote force military in general or Amara might have missed which could be a wild guess work as he has included the terms generic and specific units classified in two classes in verses 78 above and in verse 80 below quoted in my previous post. Thoughhisdatesare uncertain but he is unlikely to have flourished before the 5th century ce. much earlier than Alberuni(973-1048 AD)
