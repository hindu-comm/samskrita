It is the point in question whether Panini knew the word or not. But only the Vartika mentions the word, but without any commitment about the meaning attached to it.

But Amara is in agreement with the enumerated usage as with that in Adiparva of महाभारत which also gives the same total number of components of अक्षौहिणी a Amara is certain of it. He didn't consider अनीकिनी as synonym with सेना and has separate mention of दशानिकिन्यक्षौहिणी after the common triple multiplied units up to अनीकिनी is finished.

This is in agreement with the account given by Amarasimha and seems to be in place as far as the total number of each given in further verses of the portion in Adiparva as I have given in my post.

Here I could not find it under the precise reference number the enumeration as you have given in the DCS data base corresponding to the number given. Unless we have some other source to concord with the enumeration that differs from the units given in Adiparva, we have to double check the source.

  

  

The account given in the table below is also in accordance with the verses cited by Amara and those in Adiparva and there is no difference.

Up to this no difference from the enumeration quoted by Amara and in the total numbers given for the अक्षौहिणी in the आदिपर्व. If it is multiplied by 18, would exactly give the above numbers in the table.

  

Now the question is the total number of soldiers and elephants and horses.

There above count given counts infantry (the foot-soldiers) and cavalry (used by horse-back soldiers), and elephants in an unit. It is clear it does not consider in the above enumeration, the chariot and his rider among the soldiers number and the horses yoked in the chariots used for fighting in the unit. Excluding these the above enumeration holds good.

About this I have given the opinion of Amara, who considers चमू and अनीकिनी are used as synonyms also in addition to their use for the units of the force as given by him, for सेना which is not included in the enumeration in the आदिपर्व. So far everything in order. Only the enumeration as given by you needs checking with the original verses from the source. I could not find it in the DCS corpus.
