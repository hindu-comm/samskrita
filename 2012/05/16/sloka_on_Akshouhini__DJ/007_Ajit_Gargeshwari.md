Nothing is said about what number makes a Akshouhini in older texts  
  
The word Akshouhini is used by panini in his sutra to mean an army  
  

  
  
  
The word Akshouhini, is mentioned clearly mentioned in Ramayana to mean an army**.** It is also mentioned in Arth Shasta **.  
**

The word of Akshauhini is also used in the Bhagvata and other puranas.  
  
I am of the opinion that it was during the time of Alberuni that an exaggerated number to mean Akshouhini was in use.

Composition of Units here is a different opinion  
  

There were 9 divisions in the army namely patti,sEnAmukha,gulma,gaNa,vAhini,pruthana,chamu ,anIchini ,akshauhiNi . The largest division is a Akshouhini.

  

  

Patti - 1 Elephant, 1 Chariot, 3 Horses, 5 foot Soldiers (chaturanga Sene)

sEnAmukha - Patti X 3 - 3 Elephants,3 Chariots, 9 Horses, 15 Soldiers

gulma - sEnAmukha X 3 - 9 Elephants,9 Chariots, 27 Horses, 45 Soldiers

gaNa - gulma X 3 - 27 Elephants,27 Chariots, 81 Horses, 135 Soldiers

vAhini- gaNa X 3 - 81 Elephants,81 Chariots, 243 Horses, 405 Soldiers

pruthana- vAhini X 3 - 243 Elephants,243 Chariots, 729 Horses, 1215 Soldiers

chamu- pruthana X 3 - 729 Elephants,729 Chariots, 2187 Horses, 3645 Soldiers

anIchini - chamu X 3 - 2187 Elephants,2187 Chariots, 6561 Horses, 10935 Soldiers

akshauhiNi - anIchini X 10 - 21870 Elephants,21870 Chariots, 65610 Horses, 109350 Soldiers  
  
  
For a different Statistical account please  
  
<http://www.mahanbharat.net/mahabharat/the-war/statistics>  
  
About 2,000,000 infantry had gathered Let's see the army maintained in the same area in later times. In 300 BCE Chandragupta Maurya's army was an incredibly large force of 700,000 men, 9,000 elephants, and 10,000 chariots. In Ashoka's time, the army consisted of 600,000 infantry, 130,000 cavalry, thousands of chariots and elephants. Still later in 16th century, Ibrahim Lodi, the sultan of Delhi, maintained an army of 100,000.

Please note:  
Details of how many people were killed in the war is not clearly mentioned in the Mahabharata epic. Please see

From this it is clear that the constituents of an Akshauhini is not an exaggeration and might have been possible.
