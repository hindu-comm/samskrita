The Pandanus website does not provide a download feature but only search by keyword or line number. I had to download the entire text three lines at a time for which I used an Autohotkeys script (works similar to the DLI downloader). Some verses missing compared for which Nārāyaṇa's commentary is available, which I have typed in. I am attaching the text in IAST format for those who may be interested.  
  
*naiṣadhaṃ vidvadauṣadham

Thanks, Nityanand
