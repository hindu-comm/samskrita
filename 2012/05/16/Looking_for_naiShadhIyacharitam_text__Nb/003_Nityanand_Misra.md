Thanks for your email. A scan of the work in available under the Sky Drive of Sh. Ajit Krishnan's sky drive [http://tinyurl.com/samskritam](http://tinyurl.com/samskritam) , however I already have that. I am interested in the text of the work in ITRANS or IAST or Devnagari format. So even after scanning one needs to run some kind of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which has been done on some old Samskrita books by Google.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
