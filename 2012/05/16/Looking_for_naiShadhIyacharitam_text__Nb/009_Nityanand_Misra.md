Thanks Dr. Patel.  
  
I noticed quite a few mistakes in the text so it would be great if some volunteers can come forward to proofread this for everybody's benefit - I would have liked do it but do not have the time.  
  
One way to ensure correctness would be to parse the text into the long-short sequence to detect metres. This helps in detecting errors which are often caused by typos (e.g. r in place of ṛ) and which violate the meter. I wrote a flex parser in Linux three years ago to do the same and am willing to share it with volunteers who can take this up.  
  
Same holds true for many GRETIL texts for epics - typos and missing syllables are not uncommon.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
