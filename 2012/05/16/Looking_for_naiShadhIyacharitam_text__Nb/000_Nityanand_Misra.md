Namaste  
  
I have come across digitized PDFs of Naiṣadhīyacaritam by Śrīharṣa but could not find the text (in IAST or Devnagari) on the Internet. It is not at sanskritdocuments, sanskrit wikisource, GRETIL or Digital Corpus of Sanskrit. I also tried searching on Google with some verses in Devnagari and IAST but got no results.  
  
Does anybody have the text or know of a source for this?  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
