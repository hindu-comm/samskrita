Dear sirs

  

Incidentally, I happened to browse this page;I was reading the book by Late Ra.Ganapathy sir by name Deivathin kural and in that I came across about this book; Ramakrishna mutt has replied that they do not have this edition. I got the abridged one downloaded from sringeri mutt site. I think Dr.Bhat sir can get the copy from University of Pondicherry.

  

I was a student of Philosophy during my college days; after the materialistic pursuit since then, got freed some time ago to get back to basics \[ am 59 years old now\] for the rest of life, GOD willing.

regards and pranams

Ramasubramanian s.k.
