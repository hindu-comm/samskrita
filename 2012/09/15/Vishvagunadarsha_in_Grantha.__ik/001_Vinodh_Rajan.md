Hi,

  

The attached PDF is an old typeset. 

  

It is true that there are no modern printing presses in Grantha (atleast in Tamil Nadu). Most of the Grantha books being printed (like Tanjore Saraswati Mahal Library) are just fascimiled reprints of the old books.

  

But Grantha is still actively used for Sanskrit by Sri Lankan Tamils. I presume that would imply some sort of printing press which may function in Sri Lanka.

  

Recently people have also started using Grantha fonts to digitally publish magazines/books in Grantha script.
