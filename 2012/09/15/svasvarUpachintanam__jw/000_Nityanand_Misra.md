Namo Rāghavāya  
  
*Svasvarūpacintanam* (स्वस्वरूपचिन्तनम्) is a Muktaka composition by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya in 18 Samskrita verses. 17 verses are in the Bhujaṅgaprayāta metre while the Phalaśruti is in the Anuṣṭup metre. The work addresses questions like what I am, what I am not, what God is and what the relation between me and God is, from a Vaiṣṇava perspective.  
  
The Samskrita original text of the work is attached in the email. *Svasvarūpacintanam* has been published by Tulsi Mandal, Ghaziabad, in the book *Ṣaṣṭipūrti (Abhinandana Grantha)*, ISBN: 978-81-923856-0-0, the details of which can be found in my post on *Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā* on this forum. A poetic translation (*Padyānuvāda*) of *Svasvarūpacintanam* in Hindi has been done by Ācārya Divākara Śarmā, which is also published in *Ṣaṣṭipūrti (Abhinandana Grantha)*.  
  
Readers willing to translate this into other Indian languages or English are requested to get in touch with me over email.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
