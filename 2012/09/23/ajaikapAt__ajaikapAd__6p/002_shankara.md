Bhat Sir,

  

Thanks you very much for the explanation. Now, I understand the difference between the two forms.  

  

I would like to know how Siva came to be called 'ajaikapAt'. Is there any story of Siva having only one leg/feet?  

  

One more request - Is there any traditional commentary on the Siva Sahasranama Stotram from Mahabharata? I could not locate any, through Google search.  



regards  
shankara
