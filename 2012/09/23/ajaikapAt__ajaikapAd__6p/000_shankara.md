Pranams to all,

  

अजैकपात्/अजैकपाद् is a name of Bhagavan Siva as given in 73rd verse of Siva Sahasranama Stotram from Mahabharata -  

अजैकपाच्च कापाली त्रिशङ्कुरजितः शिवः 73

  

In the Siva Sahasra Namavali, the corresponding mantra is given as अजैकपदे नमः in some editions and as अजैकपाते नमः in some others. I request the scholars of this group to explain which of these is correct, or if both are correct. In short, my query is which of these is the dative case of अजैकपात्/अजैकपाद्?



regards  
shankara
