Can some one explain the grammatical aspect of गमः in this shloka - क्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ - from the Geeta (IInd Chapter, 3rd Shloka)?

In GeetaPravesha published by Samskrita Bharati, it claims it to be लुङ्लकारः गम् धातुः, मध्यमपुरुषः एकवचनम्. Is this correct? Isn't अगमः the लुङ्लकारः form?

  

It is correct explanation and correct form. Why doubt?

  

Please check this link for the correctness of form under the rule it is prescribed.

and also

Even if it is लुङ्लकारः, how can it give the meaning intended because लुङ् is supposed to be भूतकालः while here the meaning is intended to be an order (equivalent to लोट्)? 

  

Please read together with the highlighted portion to get the meaning given as per the phrase.

  

  

*"मा स्म* *मालं च*वारणे ।। ३.५.९१३ ।।" is the meaning for the phrase with the लुङ्.

  

Hope this makes clear the meaning. मा स्म, मा, अलम् all are these are used in prohibition. With the first, only लुङ् is used and with the last, only क्त्वा when used in prohibition अलं गत्वा will convey the same meaning. Don't go astray. मा क्लैब्यं गमः -
