Please see Murthy's explanation with declension. If you do not know the conjugation nor the rules, it will be difficult to make you understand.

The above goes to Murthy's reply wherein he has given the conjugated forms and the brief explanation of the rules without quoting them.

  

In short, मा + स्म demands the लुङ् लकार, and in which collocation, "अ" is not applied to the लुङ्. And the meaning is as given in the prohibition for the whole phrase inclusive of the verbal form in लुङ्.  

  

Hope this is clear.
