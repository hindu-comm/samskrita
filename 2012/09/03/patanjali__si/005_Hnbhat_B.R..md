Dear Madam, \\

  

I know that. But the question was about the identification of the three works mentioned in the verse and so far as the composer of the verse at least, should have been convinced of the identity. Here is a link to the discussion about the source and identify of the verse in another scholars' group:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bvparishat/UPPDjxJj_TQ/discussion>

  

Please check and feed back. Many reasons have been put for the emergence of the identification from different sources also. No body had raised any doubt in this group about this identity and hence I kept silence.

  

Thanks for raising the issue.
