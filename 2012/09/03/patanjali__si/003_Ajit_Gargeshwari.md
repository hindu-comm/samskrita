On yoga he composed the Yoga Sutras, on Grammar he wrote Mahabhashya he also wrote on Aurveda. These are the books ascribed to be written on Patanjali. Hence this verse is sung in his praise. For a view on this one can read Dasgupata's book Patanjali available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). One can also recollect Govindabhagavatpada's legend in this context. All his treatises ascribed to him are available on the internet.
