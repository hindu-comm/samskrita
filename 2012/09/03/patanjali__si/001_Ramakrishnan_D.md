Dear Sirs,

  

Yogena chittasya cha shareerasya cha malam, paanineH ashtaadhyayee-vyakaranasya mahaabhaashyam likhitwaa

vaachaam malam api dooreekrutavantaH patanjalimaharshinaH.  tam munim savinayam namaami.

(Shri Patanjali maharhi by his "Patanjali-yogasutras" removed the dirt of the mind and body, and by his "Mahabhashyam" onthe great Samskrit grammarian's Shri Panini's "Ashtadhyayi" removed the dirt of the speech

of the human beings.
