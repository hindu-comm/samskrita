Thank you all.  
  
I was reading about Kavadi worship of Murugan (Subrahmanya) in Tamil  
Nadu. I came across references to Indus Valley ideograms where a  
person carrying a pole with water pots on either end of the pole.  
  
The scholar Iravatham mahadevan thus refers to it:  
<http://murugan.org/research/mahadevan.htm#.UEYYKLIgeG4>  
//  
It is possible to interpret the Paharpur plaques depicting sepearately  
the ‘yoke-bearer' and the ‘skeletal ascetic' in terms of the  
BrahmĀnical legends of Bharadvaja (lit., ‘the bearer of victuals') and  
Dadhica (famous for his gift of his own ribs and bones) respectively.  
This is indeed more likely as the Harappan symbols from which they are  
ultimately derived would have been long forgotten when these plaques  
were made. However the extraordinary combination of the two motifs in  
one composite figure strengthens the hypothesis that they are the  
survivals of the two related motifs depicted in the Indus ideograms  
(Nos.15 and 48).

Here he says the name Bharadvaja is ‘the bearer of victuals'. I was  
confused if this has anything to do with the Rshi Bharadvaja either by  
meaning of the name or the actual Rshi in fact carries a yoke.
