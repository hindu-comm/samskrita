I don't think अनुस्वार has anything to do with anything to do with धातु-s. Otherwise it is the common feature of any धातुपाठ to give the description of the list at the beginning noting the extent of the list and the accentuation system of the items of the list at the list including the principal function common to them as परस्मैभाष or आत्मनेभाषाः for clarity, even though it is conveyed by similar terms एधादय अनुदात्तेतः उदात्ताः provided others ङित्, ञित् themselves the indicators of both the varieties.

  

And for Raam, it can be used restrictively, and only the अनुनासिक अच् is not noted separately for each धातु like other इत् markers, ञित्, ङित्, ट्वित्, etc. as they are themselves indicators of functions attached them, like इदित्, उदित्, which are dependent on उपदेशेऽजनुनासिक इत्, which is इ, उ, ऋ, लृ, etc. These last ones are marked in the Devnagari version, for the convenience of the readers.

  

If Katre's work was published in Devanagari font, it should be available somewhere. As far as I know, it was published in Roman diacritic marks with accents and I had the Index part with me. Otherwise, the symbols used as अनुदात्तेत्, etc. in the Devanagari files are already available in the list of the धातु-s.

The अनुनासिक-s are highlighted by the rules:

  

इदितो नुम् धातोः,

पुषादि-द्युतादि-लृदितः,

निष्ठाश्व्येदिताम्,

*ओदितश्च*(पा०सू० ८/२/४५)

7-2-56*उदितो वा*.

ट्विथोऽथुच्,

ड्वितः क्त्रिः,

etc. whatever not seen in the present stem or actual finite verbal stem is considered as इत्. In the case of vowels, it is needed for accentuation.
