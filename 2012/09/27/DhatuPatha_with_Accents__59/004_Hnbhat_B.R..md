Both the Sutra-s governed by the accents of the Dhatu-s and their actual appearance in the written धातुपाठ are interdependent. Not stand alone apps by themselves for a reverse engineering.

  

About the usage of these, one has to know the correct knowledge of the सूत्र-s and by reading through the accented marks, one cannot deduce the forms by looking at the marks. On the other hand, if one is conversant with the प्रक्रिया method in the regular course as laid down in the traditional texts, base on प्रक्रिया beginning from रूपकौमुदी, प्रक्रियाकौमुदी and latest and popular in the series सिद्धान्तकौमुदी a comprehensive grammar with commentaries and sub commentaries, it is one no use with accented marks or not.

  

This is my opinion. Of course, a software Engineer may try these to the maximum possible extent to derive forms, but so far the attempts are of only limited use compared to the traditional learning.  

  

One can reconstruct only the text with the help of the rules and the धातुपाठ notes on the accent system. But derivation of the forms from them, needs some more effort. Ready made tools are available on the net in numbers and one can use them instead of reconstructing the text for its own sake.

  

People may differ with generation gap, but Paninian grammar has remained unique in its application for 20 centuries. It has been said "प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्याः पाणिनीयाः" as the general norm in oral learning. If the teacher or the text says it is उदात्त, अनुदात्त, स्वरित, or अनुनासिक, it can be easily deduced that it entails the needed functions warranted by the related to the context. It has been said -
"प्रयोजनमनुद्दिश्य मन्दोऽपि न प्रवर्तते।"

  

With regards
