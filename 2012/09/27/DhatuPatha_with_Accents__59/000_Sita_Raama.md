Namaste All,

I just wanted to check with the group if anyone ever came across DhatuPatha with accents. I found one on SanskritDocuments website<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/dhatupatha_svara.pdf>

which was encoded by "Mihail" who used a book by [M S Katre](http://books.google.com/books?id=iSDakY97XckC&pg=PA1173&lpg=PA1173&dq=S.Katre+dhatupatha&source=bl&ots=ufJgTs50Zd&sig=xuEwWJAoOywhR08itMkwa8jh15o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0D5kUI20DoXe9ASuwoGwAQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=S.Katre%20dhatupatha&f=false) which was not in devanagari.

That document needs to be proofread and it would be a good idea to have a book with devanagari print for proofread.

  

I was wondering if anyone came across devanagari DhatuPatha with accents in any book format.

I would appreciate your help
