A publisher friend of mine is keen to publish an up-to-date and well-produced translation of several of Asia's most important mathematical texts including those from the Sanskrit tradition - please see his notes below for more information. He is looking for experts on these texts from each of the different language traditions.

If you are a mathematician as well as a Sanskritist and would be interested in working with him on this project, please let me know and I will put you in touch with him.

Best,

Venetia

  

Notes:

The book would be something like an Asian mathematical prequel to*[On the Shoulders of Giants](http://www.amazon.com/On-Shoulders-Giants-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0762413484),* which is a collection of the important works (in their entirety, in English) of Newton, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Einstein put together by Stephen Hawking.For the "Asian maths" version I was thinking it would be good to include, at least,[Brahmagupta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta), [Bhaskaracharya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_II), [Al-Khwarizmi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%E1%B8%A5ammad_ibn_M%C5%ABs%C4%81_al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB), and [Zhu Shijie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Shijie); maybe a few more depending on the length of these; and market it similarly, as a sort of collector's edition aimed primarily at Asian math & science professionals.
