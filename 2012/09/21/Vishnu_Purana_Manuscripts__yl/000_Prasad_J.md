Dear Members,  
  
I wanted to read Vishnu Purana in Sanskrit for my studies and I got some books by NAG publication, Gitapress, and also H Wilson's translation however there are a lot of various readings in these books. Does anyone know where will I get some authentic versions of Vishnu Purana, mostly with commentaries to understand.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad J
