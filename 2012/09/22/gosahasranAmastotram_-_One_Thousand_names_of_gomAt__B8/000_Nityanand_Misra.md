Namo Gomātre  
  
**Gosahasranāmastotram** (2005) is a composition by Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya in 111 Anuṣṭup verses and one Āryā verse. The Stotram was composed by the Guru at the Godhāma Mahātīrtha, Ānandavana. The Stotram gives one thousand names of the Gomātā, the sacred cow mother. I am pleased to share with you the Samskrita original text, the Nāmāvali and the Havanavidhi (Caturthyantanāmāvali) of the Gosahasranāmastotram.  
  
***About Godhāma Mahātīrtha, Ānandavana***  
Godhāma Mahātīrtha, Ānandavana, is one of the biggest Gośālās (cow-pens) in India. It is located at Pathmeda (पथमेड़ा), in the Barmer district of Rajasthan. Traditional accounts say it is here in Ānandavana that Aniruddha, the son of Pradyumna and the grandson of Lord Śrīkṛṣṇa, established a giant Gośālā in Dvāpara Yuga. In modern times, the ancient Gośālā was revived several times and was witness to events like Maharaja Shambhu Singh's sacrifice in 1240 AD, and the penance by Yogi Rattan Dev who campaigned for Gorakṣā during the 1857 war of independence. In 1993, the nation-wide Gosevā Abhiyāna was started from this place. As of 2005, the Gośālā was spread over 1600 acres and housed more than 55,000 cows. The lifetime devotion of Svāmī Dattaśaraṇānanda has made this place into a modern-day Vṛndāvana.  
More information about Godhāma Mahātīrtha can be obtained from their website under [www.godham.org](http://www.godham.org) and [www.pathmeda.org](http://www.pathmeda.org).  
  
***About Gosahasranāmastotram  
***Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya delivered a Kathā in the Balotara city of Barmer district of Rajasthan in February-March 2005. At the insistence of Svāmī Dattaśaraṇānanda, he stayed at the Godhāma Mahātīrtha on the night of March 5, 2005. A disciple of Svāmī Dattaśaraṇānanda, Jñānānanda Mahārāja, remarked that he had not come across a Sahasranāmastotra devoted to Gomātā in the Sanātana Dharma scriptures and literature, and requested Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya to compose one. Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya composed the *Gosahasranāmastotram* over the next few days which was written down by Jayaprakāśa Nārāyaṇa Gautama, who was the Antevāsin scribe of the Guru in 2005.  
*Gosahasranāmastotram* has been published by Tulsi Mandal, Ghaziabad, in the book *Ṣaṣṭipūrti (Abhinandana Grantha)*, ISBN: 978-81-923856-0-0, the details of which can be found in my post on *Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā* on this forum.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
