Namaste,

I came across this publisher (Ramlal Kapoor & Trust)

<http://rlktrust.org/docs/BOOKS%20DETAILS.pdf>

I got # 93 in the above mentionedcatalog. It is written by **Shri Brahma Dutta Jigyasu**. It explains Ashtadhyaayi structure in a very simple and easy to understand format. I did not come across any book which describes like this.

Prathama Vrutti written by same author is a must have for serious students who wants to learn Astadhyaayi (comes in 3 volumes).

  

**All these books are in Hindi.**

  

Poorly scanned version is available on scribd as well.

Since its in print, its a good idea to support these publishers. Anyways they do not charge a fortune for these books.

  

There contact information is as below
