Does anyone have an editable (ie: in text or Word) version of Patanjali's Yogasutras which they could send me - preferably in Unicode Devanagari? There are plenty of PDF versions available on the internet but it is not possible to copy and paste into Word. The Sanskrit Documents site has a Devanagari HTML version but it is not in Unicode. There are also transliterated versions available in text format but I do not know how to easily convert transliterated Sanskrit to Devanagari.

  

Any help would be much appreciated.
