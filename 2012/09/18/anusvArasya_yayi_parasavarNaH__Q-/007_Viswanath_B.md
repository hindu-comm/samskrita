Namaste SitaRamaji,  
  
No silent letters is probably not the same as what-you-pronounce-is-what-is-written. There are vedic verses where the pronunciation is slightly different from what is written,  
  
1. When you get a double g, (gg) you need to pronounce nasal, and not literally with two ggs. (The mantras during Sandhya-vandana, just before arghya pradana come to mind).  
  
2. When you have a visarga, you pronounce it half except when a ksha comes in immediately after it, in which case you are required to stop a little while at visarga, pronouncing it fully, before commensing again with the word staring with ksha. (couple of such occurrences in Namakam come to mind ).  
  
As long as one learns from guru, memorizes and recites, there are no issues. We have a problem only if we start looking at the script and try to pronounce.  
  
I don't know if this is because of the script we use is unable to cater to these requirements, or something else.  
  
Thanks,  
Vissu
