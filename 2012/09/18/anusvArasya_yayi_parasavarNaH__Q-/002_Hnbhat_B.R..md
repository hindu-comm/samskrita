There is no simple derivations also, why there should be any case for
परसवर्ण. The possibility for अनुस्वार is म् at the end of a word which usually be the case ending, अम् or आम् and in the middle both न् and म् would take अनुस्वार. If there is no indication of this अनुस्वार from these two sources, and instead, they are taken as having अनुस्वार naturally, as used in Hindi, I think same holds good for Sanskrit also. But strictly speaking, even if it is अनुस्वार, it should take परसवर्ण.

  

"मोऽनुस्वारः and नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि" are the two cases for अनुस्वार originated by transformation.
