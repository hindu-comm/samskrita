Vissuji

Thanks for your detailed mail however you have to excuse my itrans readingcapabilities.

here is a link to Sandyawandanam

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/Sandhyavandanam.pdf>

  

can you please point me to devanagari text. it's my personal opinion others can have their own but I do not read anything thats written in itrans or in roman fonts.

So I can not appreciate your description. For me Sanskrit is Devanagari text only and so far I did not come across the disconnect you mentioned. In devanagari text the nasalization is clearly represented.

If the discussion is going of the topic please let me know we can go over this separately without involving the group.

  

regards

Raama
