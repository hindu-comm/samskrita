Hi Sitaramaji -  
  
Here are some examples -  
  
1. For the double gg -  
  
TS : Kanda 7 - Anuvaka 1 - sarvagghyasthUriNA ....  

  
Here the double 'gg' should be pronounced with nose, almost as if it is 'gn'.  
  
2. For the visarga & ksha -  
  
TS : Kanda 4 - Rudradhyam (4-5-4)  
  
....mahadbhyaH KshullakEbhyascha....  
  
Here the visarga needs to be fully pronounced, the flow of mantra-uchcharaNa needs to be stopped for a very little while (so that it is not continious).  
  
Likewise, if there is a visarga right before a 'ka' or a 'pa', they only need to be pronounced in half.  
  
And other visargas (well, from what i read so far) are combined using sandhi, and shouldn't be pronounced explicitly.  
  
3. Another example - (sandhya vandana, right before arghya pradana )  
  
hiraNyavarNA shshuchayaH pavakA.......agniM ya....bhavantu.  
  
In this the 'agniM ya' should be pronounced as 'agniyya'  

  
This is the sandhya vandana example i mentioned incorrectly under double gg. Its not a double gg, but another example of such a rule.  
  
I am not sure i am able to explain these perfectly and correctly. All i am trying to say was that whats being written, is not exactly the same as what is to be pronounced. It is more retrofitting the speech to a written form. Matches 99.999999% but not 100%. It will mostly work for all practical spoken/written purposes.  
  
Thanks  
vissu
