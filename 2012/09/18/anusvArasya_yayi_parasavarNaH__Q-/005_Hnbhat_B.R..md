"Yamaka" and "shlesha" have many times to override grammatical rules of "sandhi" which is the licence of the poets to play with words and have nothing to do with Grammar. In Yamaka काव्य-s you can find thousands and hundreds of such formations, with splitting or without splitting, that doesn't grant automatically for any body use licentiously overriding the Paninian rules.

  

Thanks for your observations.
