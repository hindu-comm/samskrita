Here is the specific mantra I was referring to in Sandhya Vandana in deva-nagari lipi. This mantra (and some others) are missing from the vidhi as mentioned in your link. (these mantras are from taittiriya samhita, 5th kanda, 6th prasna).  

  

  

सन्ध्यावन्दनमन्त्र-s are compiled from the Vedic Texts मन्त्र-ब्राह्मण-s and not form as a part of a separate section of Vedic Literature, tailored to needs of the people from time to time. And it need not be the same, but according to the शाखा, सूत्र, गोत्र of the students of वैदिकसंप्रदाय. No point in generalizing the practices as applicable to whole of Sanskrit Literature.

> But, as I thought about this topic for some time, it occurred to me > that what-you-write-is-what-you-pronounce is kind of marrying a given > lipi (in this case, deva-nagari) with a language - sanskrit. So if we > are probably talking about the limitations of deva-nagari here, than > anything about sanskrit. This is my passing thought only and is likely > because of my limited knowledge of the lipi.

The deficiency is in the Unicode fonts used to represent a general notation for all the शाखा-s, but in print they were used in the print in the regional prints for the मन्त्र texts or संहिता texts. Now we are discussing only the Unicode alphabets, may the correct statement. Still, there have been attempts to reproduce, ardhavisarga, rotated ardhavisarga, जिह्वामूलीय, उपाध्मानीय, etc. vedic signs by the scholars in the fields gaining access software technologies. One discussion had been there in our group, about these signs long ago and I think I had given the link. If not noticed, here is the same reproduced:
