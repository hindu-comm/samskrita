Respected Scholars,



I am not conversant with Sanskrit grammar rules, let alone a grammarian. I love Sanskrit but my efforts to learn Sanskrit sufficiently failed due to inability. However, by virtue of my Travel across India I offer the following observations:

Panini's grammar related to speech and not to script. His rules are not applicable as to whether the *bindi* should be used in a particular context or *halanta ma, na, nga, nja* etc.

I observe that generally in the South writers and publishers are inclined towards use of *halanta nga, nja, Na, na* and *ma* while writers and publishers are inclined towards use of *anuswara.* In speech, in the Hindi speaking belt,*anuswara* is pronounced without a clear *na* or *ma* as in the words '*hansna', 'gaon' 'haim'* etc. Many from the South who learn Hindi or Sanskrit from books substitute it with full-fledged *ma.* First take the name of the Language - it is Samskritam in the South and even pronounced as *Sam**a**skritam,* while it is *Sa(n)skrit* in the North and perhaps, Sanskrit for the foreigners. The *ma/ na* interchange is there for all anuswaras before स, श ह. Amsam or ansh, vamsam or vansh, samsthanam or sansthan, simham or sinha. The regional influence is there in some other context also, though they may be treated as Regional Languages or अपभ्र्ंश. कुमार् of Sanskrit becomes *ku(n)war* in Hindi and कुमर or कुमरन् in Tamil.

If the substitution of *anuswara* for the halanta nasal is eliminated completely, many puns will lose their beauty.

गंगाजलंकेशवनारिकेतु: नगाह्वयो नाम नगारिसूनु: which is apparently गङ्गा, जलं, कॆशव, नारि केतु: but in fact गङ्गाज, लङ्केश, वनारि केतु: is possible only by use of \[the optional\] anuswara instead of the halanta nasal.

Similarly in

अगजानन पद्मार्कं गजानामहर्निशम्।

अनेकदंतं भक्तानां एकदंतमुपास्महे॥ एकदन्तं but अनेकदं तं

Scholarly members of the group know hundreds of such instances.

With reverence

R Subrahmanian
