Pranams to all,

  

It is said in Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi, Gita Press edition that as per the sutra 'अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः', it is wrong to write गंगा. It should be गङ्गा. I request the scholars of this group to explain whether this is a 'vikalpa vidhi' or 'nitya vidhi'. While I was reading Bhagavad Gita published by a reputed ashram, I saw that in the first chapter it is printed 'न कांक्षे विजयं कृष्ण'. Should it be काङ्क्षे in place of कांक्षे?

shankara
