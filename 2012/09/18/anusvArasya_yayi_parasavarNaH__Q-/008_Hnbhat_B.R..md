I don't know the purpose of this writing.

  

If it is to show, incompatibility of Script and Vedic recitation, it has been long ago said one who recites looking at the written material is the worst of the पाठक-s:

  

*गीती शीघ्री*शिरः कम्पी तथा लिखितपाठकः ।

अनर्थज्ञोऽल्पकण्ठश्च षडेते पाठकाधमाः ॥

  

along with the other defective readers, which imlies that it was customary to read from the written texts and was not approved and considered as lower grade ones as the purpose of this write up seems to convey.

  

Otherwise, there are many symbols used in different print outs used according to the Vedic recensions which carry the specific symbols needed by the users/teachers of the recensions after the invention of the printing convention at least. All may not need the same set of representations, as many are governed by प्रातिशाख्य of the recension and regional users at least in manuscripts form even though not available in public printing texts in general. 

  

This is my experience.
