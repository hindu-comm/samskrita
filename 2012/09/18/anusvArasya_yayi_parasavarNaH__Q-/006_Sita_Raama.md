Namaste Subrahmanianji

  

your statement - "Panini's grammar related to speech and not to script."

  

I would like to point a fact - In sanskrit there are no silent letters like english and other language. Its pretty straight forward. You write what you pronounce and youpronouncewhats written, there is no disconnect between the two.

Sanskritam is not like English where you write Walk and pronounce without "L"

Colonel - There is no "R" but you pronounce it as "Kar-nal"

  

However if you find some disconnect inpronunciation,thats because of influence of regional language be it Hindi, telugu, Tamil etc etc.

Wrong is wrong no matter where and how many are pronouncing it.
