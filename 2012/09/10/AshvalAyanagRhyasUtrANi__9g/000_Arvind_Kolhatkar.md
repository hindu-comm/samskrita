May I request the scholars to clarify whether the author of theआश्वलायनगृह्यसूत्राणि and ofआश्वलायनश्रौतसूत्राणि is अश्वल or आश्वलायन. Monier Williams on p. 116 (for अश्वल) and 159 (for
आश्वलायन) appears to suggest both possibilities. Apte on p. 237 mentions आश्वलायन as the author. His entry on अश्वल at p. 184 does not mention any attribution to these works.

  

Secondly, what would be the position under Panini ifआश्वलायन is explained as derived fromअश्वल? Would that be possible, and if so, how?
