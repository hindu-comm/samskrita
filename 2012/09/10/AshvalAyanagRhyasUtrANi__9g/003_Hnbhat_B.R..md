According to the Panini's rule, cited by MW, it can be anydescendant of the गोत्र of अश्वल. आश्वलायन is known as the author of the works mentioned and there is nothing to identify by that name personally. This is the position according to Panini. Anyhow it is not a personal name. But like Panini himself, it is popularly the name of author of अष्टाध्यायी and also जाम्बवतीविजय.
