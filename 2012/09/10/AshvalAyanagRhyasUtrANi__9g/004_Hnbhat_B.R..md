Sorry I posted my earlier before giving the Paninian derivation:

  

अश्वलस्य गोत्रापत्यं पुमान् - आश्वलायनः -

  

*पौत्रप्रभृति गोत्रम्*४।१।१६२is the technical definition, the descendants beginning from पौत्र onward would be called गोत्रापत्य. So it can be any descendant after the third generation, in the lineage of अश्वल.

  

As it can be seen in the list, नडादि, it is अश्वक as entered in the databases online. It may be अश्वल also. But the list is fixed and has got some specific restrictions.
