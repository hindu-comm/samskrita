If you mean the above, in the 3rd line of the 1st story![Inline image 3](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/fdb3ad88f7bd026c/image.png?part=0.4), it is perfect as आत्मनेपद root, कत्थ श्लाघने and not of कथ वाक्यप्रबन्धे which is in the tenth conjugation group.

  

If anything has to be said, some space given are missing :![Inline image 4](https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita/attach/fdb3ad88f7bd026c/image.png?part=0.2)or some more attention may be given in a second revision.

compoundsand अघघत such ambiguous expressions could be avoided, if possible.  

  

Anyway, thanks for Jagannatha's attempt to provide some original short stories to children.

  

With thanks and regards
