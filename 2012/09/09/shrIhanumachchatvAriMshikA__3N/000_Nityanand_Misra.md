Namo Hanumate  
  
Greetings to all Hanumān Bhaktas on the forum. I am pleased to share with you the Samskrita original text of the Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā (श्रीहनुमच्चत्वारिंशिका), a stand-alone (Muktaka) Samskrita composition in praise of Lord Hanumān by Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya. It consists of forty Catuṣpadī (Prakrit: Caupāī/चौपाई) verses, with two Dvipāda (Prakrit: Dohā/दोहा) verses at the beginning and two at the end. It has the same structure and prosody as the Hanuman Chalisa in Awadhi by Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa - the only difference is that there are two Dohās at the end instead of one. It can be sung in the same tune, e.g. like the popular rendition of the Hanuman Chalisa by Hari Om Sharan. Though inspired by the Hanuman Chalisa, it is not an exact poetic translation.  
  
***About the metres  
***Caupāī and Dohā are Prakrit metres. Both are Mātrika (मात्रिक) metres.  
A Caupāī consists of two parts of 16 instants (मात्राs) each, with a caesura (Yati) after the eighth instant in each part. Sometimes the Yati can come between two instants of a long मात्रा, in which case there is no caesura. The two parts rhyme at the end.  
A Dohā consists of two parts of 24 instants each, with a caesura after the thirteenth instant in each part. Both parts end with a trochee (long syllable followed by short) and rhyme at the end.  
  
***Hanum****ān and Samskrita  
***In popular belief, Hanumān is a great Vaiyyākaraṇa, singer of Sāmaveda and the author of Mahānāṭaka (also called Hanumannāṭaka). The Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa and other traditions describe him as a speaker of refined Samskrita. The Vinayapatrikā (stanza 28) describes him as great expounder of Nigama, Āgama and Vyākaraṇa and singer of Sāmaveda. Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā also addresses him as the jewel amongst grammarians and the singer of Sāma (शाब्दिकमणिसामश्रुतिगाता****).  
  
***Hindi translation  
***Śrīhanumaccatvāriṃśikā along with its Hindi translation by the poet is published by Tulsi Mandal, Ghaziabad, in the book *Ṣaṣṭipūrti (Abhinandana Grantha)*, which was published on the occasion of 60th birthday of the poet.
