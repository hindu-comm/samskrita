hariH OM,  
Dr. Kolhatkar,

  
  
Yet none of them have the foggiest idea of what India's ancient tradition has been, nor are the interested in finding it for themselves."  

 I think the above sentence of yours is out of touch with current reality. I can see a clear cut difference in erudition between the past and the present generation regarding our traditions. If you think what is dished out by the likes of pollock are in tune with Indian traditions, we have no quarrel with you.

  
  
"The upwardly mobile internet generation is flocking to temples to obtain 'Prasad' and to Babas/Gurus for spiritual comfort and is swelling the ranks of extremist political parties."  

 I personally don't find anything wrong in people going to obtain prasad to temples, and "Babas / Gurus" for spiritual comfort. It will suffice to say that this is the innermost urge of many (if not all). Nor is there any quarrel with people joining "extremist" parties because the words that you are using have "foggy" definitions. Secondly, we live in a democratic setup which gives us ample freedom to join any party we wish (no matter how "foggy" their ideologies).

  
  
" India's economic policies from Independence to the current information age and which he wrote after retiring from his very well-paid job as CEO of Proctor and Gamble India. That should give one an idea of his intellectual breadth."  

 This is the exactly what we are against: the alarmist comments about samskR^itam and samskR^itam learning by an otherwise well-read person (following up on the alarmist comments of someone who has a stake in peddling a certain scare).  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
