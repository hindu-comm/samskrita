hariH OM,  
shrii jaiswal,  
  
 Please don't heed the call of alarmists like sheldon pollock. We have to just continue learning samskR^itam regardless of what others say. They have a vested interest in scare mongering. The original article appeared here:

I had recently written a critique of the article here:

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
