"To be truly ‘whole’ is to realize that mythical themes are universal and portray eternal truths of mankind, and can help us to cope with life at different stages."

One of the problems of thinking objectively is the concept that many Indians hold dear and repeat such as- "eternal truths". What is wrong in regarding mythology simply as mythology? Just stories and fables and then moving on.
