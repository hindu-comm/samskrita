That's true.  But still, even those who know a little of Samskritam and others who are scholars, must feel free to talk in Samskritam to make the language popular (janabhasha), thereby the common literate persons get themselves interested to learn and speak like we start conversing in English when we meet in the bazaar or in offices.

Regards.
