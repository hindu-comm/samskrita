Dear Group,

  

I have read the above responses to the article contained in the original post, which is authored by Gurcharan Das, in which he has quoted an observation of Prof. Sheldon Pollock of Columbia University. That observation has brought forth righteous anger, as, for example, in the blog cited above.

  

While one may or may not agree with Sheldon Pollock's views, it is also necessary to look at the other serious observations of Gurcharan Das. I personally tend to agree with what he says. The upwardly mobile internet generation is flocking to temples to obtain 'Prasad' and to Babas/Gurus for spiritual comfort and is swelling the ranks of extremist political parties. Yet none of them have the foggiest idea of what India's ancient tradition has been, nor are the interested in finding it for themselves. This is the burden of what Gurcharan Das says. He is not mainly talking about the quality of the education imparted in institutions that specialize in teaching Sanskrit and related subjects.
Some of them are truly excellent and the same is true of the output of some of the modern-day scholars. However, those exception should not divert our attention away from the general rot from which awareness of India's cultural richness suffers.

  

I, for myself, always read with attention what Gurcharan Das writes in his pieces. He is one among the few Indian writers who can write with felicity on divers topics concerning Modern India. One should read his celebrated best-seller 'India Unbound' in which he traces shifts in India's economic policies from Independence to the current information age and which he wrote after retiring from his very well-paid job as CEO of Proctor and Gamble India. That should give one an idea of his intellectual breadth.
