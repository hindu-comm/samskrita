In order to preventfalse opinions or hearsay on Samskrta( which
equalisehigh level vakyartha scholarship withtemple-going-mentality-

or prostrating in front of babas / gurus for \`\`prasadas'' ) we have to do these:



1.Instead of useless Sanskrit festivals, (in which the ignorantpersons glorify Samskrta in non-Samskrta languages) wehave to arrangeSamskrta programmes, Please don't call these programmes \`\`Sanskrit festivals''.Focus should be on more Samskrta programmes and not mere nonsensical talks.Seminars on Modern Shastric works (including commentaries)and Sahitya works is a desideratum.

Needless to say, Modern Samskrta book exhibition is a must.



2.Pressurising the government to release sufficient funds to public libraries for purchasing modern Samskrta works (including Shastric works) is needed very urgently.



3.The harsh reality is there is no publisherof Modern Samskrta literature. Yes, there are somepublishers like arvaachiinasamskrtam.But whether they are in\`\`publication business'' is hundred dollar question. Simply printing the works and distributing them is not
publication business. At present, the modern Samskrta writers are spendingmoney from their own pocket and get their works printed. They usually gift the books freely to the friends. This is notgenuine publication process. We, as readers, have to make ahabit of purchasing
modern Samskrta books. This is very common in the languages other than Samskrta.(That's why the authorsof non-Samskrta languages can depend on writing for their livelihood)



I have been hearing the talk that we have to resort to foreign countriesto study Samskrta in near future sincesome thirty years.But here the question is what will the foreignersteach? Will they teach us how to write Shastric works in good Samskrta ?



Scholars from foreign countries visit our institute frequently.I must say thatin most of the cases, I felt disappointed by observingtheir
level of knowledge. I do not want to generalize. Yes, there arethousands of top ranking scholars in foreign countries. This is true even with Indian scenario.



Overgeneralizing is very dangerous habit.
