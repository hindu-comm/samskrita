Author of the article does not have least knowledge about the writers of Samskrta and it is proved by his mentioning only a fewscholars of yesteryear who wrote in English.The authorcan be advised to readthe article ofDr.V.Raghavan on Modern Samskrta literature in the book **Contemporary Indian Literature(**pub.Sahitya Academy). There are several publications of this kind.Most of the Samskrta students at Dr. HariSimha Gowr University, Sagar havebeen choosingmodern Samskrta literature to write thesis for their Ph.D.Samskrita is not surviving because of some research productions in English.This language
issurviving because of writers in Samskrta. New commentaries and research works are being written in Samskrta. One can find students ofUttama, Madhyamaor Adhamain every subject and Samskrta is not an exception. On seeing a few Adhama students, do not conclude that Uttama students of Samskrta are not existing anywhere in our country. In the publication **Sixty Years of Sanskrit Studies** Vol 2(Pub.Rashtriya Samskrta Samsthana) it is clearly stated that in some countries(ex. Germany) Samskrta is being sidelined in some universities. Any language can be survived in daily conversation plus pure literature of that language itselfand not mere research works in different languages. Literary part of Samskrta is not less in modern days.With the effort of SamskrtaBharati, Samskrta conversation circle is widening day by day. Short stories, novels, padya, gadya,stotra and even Shastric works are being composed in Modern Samskrta.

Literary patrimony of Samskrtadoes not need Gurus of abroad.
