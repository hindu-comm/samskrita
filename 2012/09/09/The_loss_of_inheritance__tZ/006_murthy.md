Yes. Certainly a lot of first rate literature is being produced in Samskrit even today. Those who have some doubts in this matter could have a look at "Arvacinasamskritam" a quarterly published by Devavani Prishad Delhi. However, it is also true that amongthose who have a command over Samskrit only a very few try to create new literature. Most are content to flaunt their knowledge or end up composing stotras. It is also to be admitted that contribution of Western scholars generally has greater depth than those of their Indian counterparts.It is a pity that even among Sanskrit-enthusiasts a large number is only interested in devotional or religious texts.
