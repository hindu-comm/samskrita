**1.Writing started in India only after development of Praakrta.**

Please consider these points:

**uta tvah pashyan na dadarsha vacham uta tvah shrnvan na shrnotyenam\|**

**Uto tvasmai tanvam visasre jaayeva patya ushatii suvaasaah \|\|(**Rigveda 10.71.4)

*dadarsha vaacham*. Darshana of a language means seeing a script. Otherwise there is no seeing. \[*shronotyenaam*. Shravana of this(=language ) means hearing a voice\]

Creation ofpadapaatha, ghanapaatha, and even very complicated jataapaatharequire a vedic text in written form.

Composing Nirukta of Yaska necessitates a vedic text in written form.

Governance of Kings in Vedic era needed a script for issuing written orders /messages .

**2 Grantha is not used in print.**

Thousands of books are printed.I downloaded soft copyofvishvaguna darsha champu printed in grantha script.
