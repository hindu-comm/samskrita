Very simple answer is that when Sanskrit became to be called देवभाषा, the script used for writing is also called देवनागरी. Like, the same variation used to write ग्रन्थ साहिब् - of गुरुनानक is called गुरुमुखी, though the Language is Punjabee. A variety of ग्रन्थ script, commonly developed for writing Sanskrit in Malayalam and Tamil mixed, script is called Thulu script used to write Sanskrit in Tulu language speaking area, and the same is designed as Tigalari script in north Karnataka, where Tulu is not the regional language. In Malayalam speaking area, it is read fluently as well as Malayalam script and in Tamil speaking area, it is popularly known as Grantha script, though there is minor script.

  

Now the question again comes, why Devanagari is only called as such, while Sanskrit was written in different scripts, even in another variety of Devanagari, called Nandi Nagari, which is used in the South Indian Inscriptions and palm-leaves to write Sanskrit only.

  

All are evolved from Brahmi script or Indus Script accordingly modified and named in different regions according to their emotional attachment, as Nandi Nagari, Devanagari etc. And for antiquity, though Panini namesयवनानीas the name of the scriptलिपिof यवन-s, he doesn't even give any derivation or mention toदेवनागरीscript we are fond of using to write Sanskrit today. How to prove the antiquity? Panini only names भाषाand छन्दस्.
