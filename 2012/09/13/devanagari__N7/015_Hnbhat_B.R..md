Without much to be added in detail by Mr.Shambhu, it is enough to say "सर्वे दृश्यर्था ज्ञानार्थाः" is the accepted maxim in the field of Grammar and which the bold declaration,

  

  

शिवसूत्र (वार्तिका)

न सोऽस्ति प्रत्ययो लोके यः शब्दानुगमादृते । ।

अनुविद्धमिव ज्ञानं सर्वं शब्देन गम्यते । । वार्तिका१.४:५ ।

  

which is followed by traditional interpretations. The same is followed by modern interpretations so as to include every achievement of mankind in the Vedic Heritage or Vedic Science which is a recent trend.

  

It is a common usage in English also, I see - meaning to I understand, or I can physically visualize or mentally visualize both can be meant. The same case with this.

  

I have no further comments on modern Interpretations either scientific or by ब्राह्मी vision of the seers.

  

Depends on the appetite of the reader.
