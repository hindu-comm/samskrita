A comparatively good analysis. The paleography deals with the different writing systems and technical science dealing with the scripts used for inscriptions. The other usage of script for writing Sanskrit depends on the script used by the regional languages, if they have any independently developed script or common offshoot of one pair like Telugu and Kannada and Tamil and Malayalam.

  

Here is an account of the development of modern Devanagari script, but not attested with proofs:

Here is the Vikipedia articles page Devanagari development from original Brahmi:

Here is an article in Hindi or Marathi:

Thanks for many responses and especially the recent one by Mr.Jagannath. The prohibition of reciting by looking into the written material, appears in Paniniya shiksha itself:

  

  
गीती शीघ्री शिरःकम्पी*तथा**लिखितपाठकः*।अनर्थज्ञोऽल्पकण्ठश्च षडेते पाठकाधमाः ॥।। ३२ ।। माधुर्यमक्षरव्यक्तिः पदच्छेदस्तु सुस्वरः ।

धैर्यं लयसमर्थं च षडेते पाठकाः गुणाः ।। ३३ ।

  

which attests the practice of writing prevalent at the Time of writing Paniniya shiksha itself.

  

Many speculations may be made why it is called देवनागरी, in contrast with नागरी, and नन्दिनागरी and only any written proof would settle the matter, other than mere etymology which may vary according to the speculations.
