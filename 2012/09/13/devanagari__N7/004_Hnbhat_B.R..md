Please quote the lines of the grammarian who has said it with precise reference. The meaning can be derived by anyone who know Sanskrit.

  

नगरे भवाः नागराः, तेषामियं नागरी, देवानां नगरम् - देवनगरम्, तत्र भवा देवनागराः, तेषामियं देवनागरी, but such derivations do not say anything about the script. It can be said of any thing belonging to a city of देव-s. If there is any specific Grammarian quotes any source, that would be enough. Grammar has nothing to do with the script as far as I know and hasn't anything to do with the script in which it is written. Grammar is independent of the script used to record the spoken language (as a written language).

  
Anyhow thanks for the information. Waiting for the precise information.
