 As Dr.H.N.Bhat says, all scripts are evolved from Brahmi script. Gradually, several variations were developed from this Brahmi. Broadly these variations (ofour country ) can be classified as Southern Brahmi and Northern Brahmi. All the Northern Indian scripts like Sharada, Ranjana,Kutila, Bengali, Oriya, Gurumukhi, Nagari are offshoots of this variety.

Nagari is a script of city as the name itself suggests. Devanagari
is a variety ofold Nagari. The word Deva here means (most probably) Mahadeva. (Naamaikadeshagrahanena naamagrahanam) According to the popular belief, Mahadeva dwells in Kashi. Devanagara means Kashi. The script which was in vogue in and around Devanagara(=Kashi) was called Devanagari.



The correct word derivation of Nandinagari is disputable.



Vatteluttu, Koleluttu, Tamilu, Grantha, Kannada, Telugu, Tigalari and Malayalam-these are offshoots of Southern Brahmi.



Grantha means Samskrta Grantha. Samskrta cannot be written correctly in Tamilu because of lack of some phonetic symbols (particularly, some ghosha varnas of grouped consonants). In order to tackle this problem, Samskrta scholars of Tamilunadu invented a separate script which is used exclusively for writing Samskrta and that is Grantha script. This Grantha is still in use in some places of Tamilunadu. Even today some places of Tamilunadu. like Kanchi and Kumbhakonam have some letter presses of Grantha script.

Malayalam is evolved from Grantha. In between Grantha and Malayalam, a sub variety emerged which is called Tigalari. It was very popular in some areas of Karnataka( Kasaragodu, Honnavara, Udupi etc..) Tigalari script was used to write Samskrta profusely. But a few Kannada works and Tulu works are available in this script. Hence, the nameTulu script is a misnomer.(I do know that there is an entry Tuluscript in Wikipedea.The name is wrong according to Sri Gundajois of Keladi who is specialist in Tigalari script).



Samskrta can be written in several scripts. (Outside of our country- Bhota or Tibetan, Simhali, Khmer etc.) Now everywhere people are using Devanagari for writing Samskrta. In the days of manuscripts, all the scholars used the scripts that were in vogue in their living region. Even while printing the Samskrrta works, printers used scripts of their
region. The reason why Devanagari is used widely for writing
Samskrta now a days is obvious: Firstly, there were more letter presses in Northern India in the places like Kashi. It was quite natural that they were printing the books of both Hindi and Samskrta in Devanagari. Secondly, the letter presses like Nirnayasagara useda wide variety of sizes in fontsas well bold, italic and the like. They used very good
quality paper in the books. But in letterpresses like Vidyamudraksharashaala in Mysore, only one font without varieties was used. Even the paper quality was not praiseworthy. Gradually scholars of non-devanagari belt were attracted to Devanagari and started to learn Devanagari.



But, even today, writing Samskrta in non-devanagari scripts is not uncommon as all of us know. It is not correct to say that Samskrta shall be written in only Devanagari. If you want to write Samskrta in Oriya script, write in Oriya script, that’s all.



Devanagari is widely used while writing Samskrta and it is because of practicality. The Devanagari version of Shabdakalpadruma which we are now seeing is of second edition. In the first edition, Vanga script was used to print it.



Some of the scripts like Sharada Kutila, Ranjana, Nandinagari andTigalari are not used now. Fortunately hundreds of scholars are available who know these scripts. But obviously they have learnt these scripts for research purpose and not daily use.



The popular belief that, one script for one language and vice versa is not correct. One(single)script can be used for writing several languages like Roman and Devanagari. One(Single)language can be written in several scripts like Samskrta.
