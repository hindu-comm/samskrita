अष्टाध्यायी

ASHTADHYAYI  
<http://www.navelgazing.net/2018/10/ashtadhyayi.html>

  

The Ashtadhyayi is a sutra-style treatise on Sanskrit grammar, estimated to have been completed between 6th and 4th centuries BCE by Acarya Panini. The 3,959 aphorisms on linguistics, syntax and semantics presented in "eight chapters" are the foundation of Sanskrit grammar.   
  
The Ashtadhyayi is the foundation of vyakarana (grammatical tradition). It is the starting point of Classical Sanskrit. Panini's analysis of noun compounds still forms the basis of modern linguistic theories of compounding in Indian languages.

  

The Ashtadhyayi takes materials from lexical lists (dhatupatha, danapatha) as input and describes algorithms to be applied to them for the generation of well-formed words. It is highly systematised and technical. Inherent in its approach are the concepts of the phoneme, the morpheme and the root. Its sophisticated logical rules and technique have been widely influential in ancient and modern linguistics.

  

The Ashtadhyayi was not the first description of Sanskrit grammar. But it surpassed its predecessor to such a great extent that all earlier works have faded into oblivion.

  

This seminal work played an important role in making Sanskrit the preeminent language of learning and literature in ancient and medieval India. It has attracted and continues to attract many excellent commentaries, among them Patanjali’s Mahabhashya and Bhattoji Dikshit’s Vaiyakarana Siddhanta Kaumudi. The classical works of Sanskrit grammarians which flourished during the 8th and 15th centuries (and a revival in the 17th and 18th) are essentially commentaries on Panini.

  

There are numerous works on the Ashtadhyayi available today. Here are some of the best and most useful books:
