Namaste,

I do not mean to create duplicate post but could find a proper previous mail to reply it to so starting a new thread.

  

I found this good link with nice & simple commentary on AshtAdhyAyi

<http://www.scribd.com/collections/3752296/Paniniya-Ashtadhyayi-Pravachanam>

  

For hindi speaking people or people who are fluent at Hindi, these books are a treat. I hope someone will find this useful.

It also gives a nice and simple one line explanation in Sanskrit as well.
