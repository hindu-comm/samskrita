Namaste All,

I came across this book "Sanskrit Pathan-Pathan ki anubhoot saraltam vidhi" by brahma duttaji jigyasu.

English version of that book is called "The Tested Easiest Method of Learning and Teaching Sanskrit" by same author.

In chapter 8 he talked nicely about the organization of Lopa sutras.

I am attaching my notes on that chapter I hope someone find it useful.

  

Red Number - Siddhanta Kaumudi

Blue Number - Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi
