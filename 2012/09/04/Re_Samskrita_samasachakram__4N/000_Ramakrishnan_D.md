Both are correct.

1\. It is a single person, if we take the first and second words as adjectives for Govinda.  For Govinda who is achyuta and also ananta, for him namaH.

  

2\. It is plural. For three persons namely, Achyutaaya namaH, Anantaaya namaH and Govindaaya namaH .

  

I wish to know from otherscholars. Thank you.
