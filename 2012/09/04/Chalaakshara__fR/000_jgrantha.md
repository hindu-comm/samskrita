Shree Satyajit Borwankar has asked about

the meaning of Chalaakshara.

I have attachedapiece from Vedalakshana, a Catelogue of

Vedic ancillary literature by Sri Kota Parameshvara Aital.

I think it is related to the question of Shree Satyajit Borwankar.

I sincerely apologize all the members

 in advance if it is unrelated.

S.Jagannatha.
