You have correctly grasped the meaning and it is a fact.

But whatever you see in print need not be correct according to grammar. Hence only your understanding is correct. The others not conforming to the above rule, are wrong.The two optional forms are available only in writing Sanskrit only and does not apply to Hindi writing, which does not have any strict rules for these two. Hence many do not care for this difference, in writing Sanskrit also and such forms need not be taken as authentic.

  

Hope this clears your doubt.
