and the article on it is to be found in this page:

  

<http://www.the-south-asian.com/aug2004/Gilgit_manuscript.htm>

  

It had not been decieferred for long.

  

> Some reference of the script and description of the sutras can also be > found in an eight-volume serialisation of the manuscript done by Prof. > Nalinaksha Dutt in the 50s. His work suggests that verses in the text > are composed in Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. The vocabulary is > derived from ancient Buddhist texts in Prakrit.

Does it look like present day Devanagari? The date of it is not uniformly confirmed and varies between at least 1000 years.
