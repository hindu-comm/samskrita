Namo Rāghavāya  
  
*Śrīrāghavāṣṭapadī* (श्रीराघवाष्टपदी) is a Muktaka composition by Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya in eight Samskrita verses. The eight verses are in the Āryā metre, and are followed by a concluding verse in a variant of the Āryā metre. The work was composed on the occasion of Vasantapañcamī in 2011 (February 8, 2011) during the Sarasvatīpūjana by the Guru. The Samskrita original text of the work is in the attached PDF. As some verses are difficult to understand without a commentary, I have attached snapshots of the Hindi meaning, also authored by the Guru, in the handwriting of Paṇḍita Vikāśa Kumāra Tivārī (currently known as Ujjvala Śāṇḍilya) who was one of the Antevāsin scribes of the Guru during 2011.  
  
The work is replete with the Anuprāsa and Yamaka figures of speech, rhyme and devotion to Śrīrāma. Hope both the lovers of poetry and the devotees of Śrīrāma will enjoy reading the poem.  
  
*Śrīrāghavāṣṭapadī* has been published by Tulsi Mandal, Ghaziabad, in the monthly journal *Śrītulasīpīṭhasaurabha*, Volume 11, Issue 9, published in the month of February 2011. The publication is accompanied by the Hindi translation by the Guru.  
  
Readers willing to translate this into other Indian languages or English are requested to get in touch with me over email.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
