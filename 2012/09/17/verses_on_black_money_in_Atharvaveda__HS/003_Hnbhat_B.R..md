Exactly the Atharva Veda is equated with Black magic and so the money referred to in should be also black, which supports the contention with the same token, black money was practiced to be hoarded since Vedic Times. Anyhow, one is free to interpret as one likes, if one knows some Sanskrit words. Wish you all the best.

  

I too add to this that bribery also practiced in Vedic Times, which adds to the black money hoarded so. I found match fixing today prevalent was also in practice. There is a शस्त्रमन्त्र appropriated with Ashvin-s and a legend is there in ऐतेरेयब्राह्मण how they got the शस्त्रमन्त्र in their name, though it shares with other deities also Agni, Indra and others. A running race was arranged from गार्हपत्याग्नि on earth up to सूर्यमण्डल for the देवता-s, in which a winner was announced to be awarded the शस्त्रमन्त्र. Aitereya Brahmana Chapter 17.2. Agni overtook them first in the race, Ashvin-s persuaded to withdraw on the agreement to give him a share in the शस्त्र. Then came उषस् devata-s and they also made to withdraw content with one mantra share in the शस्त्र. And so on, whenever some Devata overtook, Ashvin-s shared with him the शस्त्र with one mantra or two each. And at the end, they won the शस्त्रमन्त्र in their name. Hence it is called आश्विनशस्त्र and one or two मन्त्र-s are given for Agni etc.

  

How is it? One can find this episode with SayaNa-s commentary in the 17th Chapter, 2nd Khanda.
