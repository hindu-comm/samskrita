How I wish The composers of Vedic Hymns knew Black Money they might have know Black Magic!!. Coveting excess wealth greed are condemned in many verses of the Vedas. If verses talk against greed can be interpreted as black money one can have ones interpretation.  
  
I am not sure whether the composers of the vedic hymns or during the vedic age taxes were collected in the form of money. The word Bali is an Old word.
