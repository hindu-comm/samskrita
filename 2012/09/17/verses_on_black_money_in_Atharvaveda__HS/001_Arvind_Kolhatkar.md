Jaideep,

  

I do not pretend to understand the Atharva Veda text but found the following translation by Griffiths at[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av07115.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av07115.htm)



(७,११५.१अ) प्र पतेतः पापि लक्ष्मि नश्येतः प्रामुतः पत।

(७,११५.१च्) अयस्मयेनाङ्केन द्विषते त्वा सजामसि ।।१।।

Hence. Evil Fortune! fly away, vanish from this place and fromthat.  
We fix thee with an iron hook unto the man who hateth us.



(७,११५.२अ) या मा लक्ष्मीः पतयालूरजुष्टाभिचस्कन्द वन्दनेव वृक्षं।

(७,११५.२च्) अन्यत्रास्मत्सवितस्तां इतो धा हिरण्यहस्तो वसु नो रराणः।।२।।

Granting us riches, Savitar! golden-banded, send thou awayfrom us to other regions

That Fortune who, flying, abominable, hath, as a creeper climbsa tree, assailed me.



(७,११५.३अ) एकशतं लक्ष्म्यो मर्त्यस्य साकं तन्वा जनुषोऽधि जाताः।

(७,११५.३च्) तासां पापिष्ठा निरितः प्र हिण्मः शिवा अस्मभ्यं जातवेदो नियछ ।।३।।

One and a hundred Fortunes all together are at his birth bornwith a mortal's body.  
Of these we send away the most unlucky: keep lucky ones forus, O Jātavedas.



(७,११५.४अ) एता एना व्याकरं खिले गा विष्ठिता इव।

(७,११५.४च्) रमन्तां पुण्या लक्ष्मीर्याः पापीस्ता अनीनशं ।।४।।

I have disparted these and those like cows who stray on commonland.  
Here let auspicious Fortunes stay: hence have I banished evilones.



The above text condemns ill-earned wealth. 'Black Money', which is concept born out of modern-day taxation of income, is not co-terminuswith 'ill-earned money'. 'Black money' is income on which tax should have been paid but has not been paid. Ill-earned money, such as that from illegal activities is most likely not disclosed for tax purposes and may become black money, but that need not always be true.
A person who has earned income from an illegal activity may want to use it as a source of capital for some other activity and may decide to offer it for taxation as income derived from another legal activity. In that case even income from an illegal activity ceases to become black money.

As there was no taxation of income in the modern sense at the time of Atharva Veda, I think the above text refers to ill-earned wealth and not to 'black money'.
