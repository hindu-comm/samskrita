I’ve just received a letter from Anandashram-sanstha of Pune that they have opened a website on 30^(th) August, 2012 at

<http://www.anandashram-sanstha.org>



I checked it and saw that they have stopped publishing Sanskrit books.

Their Publications page shows that they have list for Marathi and English books. Sanskrit list is missing.

They have written that only reprints are made available on demand and the price is Rs. 3/page.
