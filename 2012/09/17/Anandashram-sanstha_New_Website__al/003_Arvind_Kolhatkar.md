Dear Group,

  

The name of 'Anandashram' brings up several several associations with the Chitpavan-Brahmin-dominated old orthodox Poona of the days of the late 19th century-early 20th century. Those interested in Sanskrit studies may find the following informative.

  

'Anandashram' was founded in 1887 by Mahadev Chimanaji Apte, B.A.LL.B., a prominent citizen of Poona, in order to protect and promote orthodox learning. He was a very successful pleader - he defended Vasudeo Balawant Phadke, who led an armed struggle against the British power in the 1880's and who ended his life in Aden as a convicted prisoner - and had gathered enough wealth, which he used to found 'Anandashram' and a printing press of the same name to print old manuscripts that he gathered. On many Anandashram publications of the early days, his name appears as the printer. Anandashram operated out of the Apte property located in the heart of old Poona. I attach below a photo of it, where Anandashram stil survives, a mere shadow of its old self!

  

Towards the end of his life Mahadev Chimanaji Apate had taken Sanyasa.
Upon his demise, a statue of his was put up by his descendants in the openquadranglein the middle of the Anadashram property, where it still stands.

  

It is my impression that Anandashram is a property of the joint family of the Aptes and someone from the Apte family has always been the chief person of Anandashram. With the decline in study of the traditional Sanskrit learning, the activitiy of Anandashram too slowed down considerably. As of today, they have a large collection - about 15,000 manuscripts according to a newspaper report - of unpublished manuscripts and a large inventory of unsold printed books. I suppose it is theseoldprints that they are offering to the interested buyers at Rs. 3 per page.

  

To my knowledge, this Apte family has contributed to the Society two other names that are recognized, one for a desirable reason and the other for an undesirable one. Mahadev Chimanaji's nephew Hari Narayan Apteunder the supervision of his unclestudied in and graduated from the Deccan College. Hari Narayanfelt very keenly about the social evils such as child marriages and the deplorable condition of widows in joint families. He wrote several novels and books on these issues. He was the most well-known progressive writer of his times and some of his works are now considered classics of Marathi literature. The other prominent Apte was Narayan Apte, hanged with Nathuram Godse as one of the assassins of Gandhiji. According to Manohar Malgaonakar's celebrated book, 'The Men Who Killed Gandhi', a veryreadablestudy of the assassination, Narayan Apte belonged to a branch of this Apte family.

  

Declining interest in the study of the traditional knowledge andconsequentlack of finance has made the management of Anandashram very difficult, according to newspaper reports. The large collection of unpublished manuscripts needs to be preserved but they do not know where the money is going to come from for it.

  

To conclude this small note. I may share a personal memory of Anandashram. Several years ago, I was trying to read and understand Bhaskaracharya's LIlAvatI. I knew that a Marathi version of it made by Khanapurkar Shastri was available in Anandashram. I paid a visit to Anandashram one day to procure it. I was directed to a large hall at the back of Anandashram. It was full of old printed books in total disarray and an elderly gentleman was sitting there. He could not find what I wanted but generously allowed me to rummage through heshelvesof books and take out what I fancied. I did find Khanapurkar Shastri's LIlAvatI and also a couple of other related books that I noticed. Those books were sold to me at the price printed on the books, though the price was by then several decades old!
