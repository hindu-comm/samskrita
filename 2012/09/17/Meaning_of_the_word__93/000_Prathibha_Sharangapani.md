namaste,  
  
I am a novice samskritam learner. I am also interested in music. I wanted to find out about the meaning of a verse in a song.  
  
paatita suraripu paadapa brinda  
paavana charita paraamritakhanDa  
natya rasotkata nanaabharana  
narayana teertharchita charana  
  
I searched for the meaning of brinda in all dictionaries. I could not find it anywhere. Why is it so? I know it means 'TuLasi' but I wanted to know the meaning in the context of the song. Learned members, please let me know the meaning of the above verse and also the reason for not finding the word 'brinda' in the dictionary.  
  
Thanks  
Prathibha
