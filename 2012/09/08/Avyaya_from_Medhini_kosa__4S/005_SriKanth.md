Sorry my mistake. I was talking to someone about Medhini Kosa and  
Vaijayanti Kosa and while writing the email wrongly wrote it.  
  
Unlike Amarakosa I see both medhini and vaijayanti has a lot chapters;  
some of them even classifying words as 2 letter words, 3 letter words  
etc. I still need to read through the vaijayanti.
