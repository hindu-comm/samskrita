Sushrutha is often quoted as being the same as Charaka, who lived almost in the same period as Varaaha Mihira (as quoted by various authors like Kaalidhaasa, Amara Simha, etc), although Sushrutha might have been a little older.

  

I doubt if we can take his reference as the origin as quoted by Varaaha Mihira; perhaps he might be quoting from the puraanas which were (traditionally) said to be much older to his life time. For example, Vishnu Puraanam is written by Vyaasa although the content was actually preached by his father Paraas\`ara which may be prior to Mahaa Bhaaratha war which is said to have happened some 5000 years ago.

  

At least there are references to 'graha' or planets in the vedhic times in "Nava Graha Sooktham" and the description of jyothisha nakshathras\[zodiacal starts\] in"Nakshathreshti".

  

However, neither of these talk about the origin either the 'graha' or 'nakshathra' so those details might have been given in some other puraana.
