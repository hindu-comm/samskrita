In बृहत्-संहिता, at the conclusion of chaper 1 (उपनयनाध्यायः), Varahamihira says:

  

प्रश्नप्रतिप्रश्नकथाप्रसङ्गान् स्वल्पोपयोगान्ग्रहसम्भवांश्च

सन्त्यज्य फल्गूनि च सारभूतं भूतार्थमर्थैः सकलैः प्रवक्ष्ये ॥ ११ ॥

  

.... I exclude details of origin of the planets ....

There is a commentary that the origin of the planets is discussed in the purANas. Could somebody point out the relevant purANas to me, please?

  

Thanks in advance for the reply.

(Question has been in draft stage since end of July!)
