Dear Samba ji,  
 This book is on astrology, a collection of astrology and its history related articles. There is only eBook copy available and the eBook costs Rs.250/- This was just one article from that book.  
 I plan to do a book on 'Astrology and Astronomy in Vedic Literature' but not now. As of now many work in pending. Before I touch I touch that subject, I want to do a translation of Atharva Veda Parisishta, but before that too many astrology works in pending. So I can only that this is is one of the subjects I might take up later.  
Love and regards,  
Sreenadh
