(The Guru, who dwells in) the lotus surrounded by the divine petals ham  
and sah, which reside in all beings and are the cause of the world,  
manifested the world in his own way and of his own free will. Meditate  
on the Guru, who reveals That, who is the expression of the shambhava  
state (Shivahood), who illumines like the flame of a lamp, who is  
eternal and all-pervasive, and who is a visible form of all letters.
