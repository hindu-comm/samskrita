It simply in accordance with the statement  

  

*इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां*वेदं समुपबृंहयेत् (१.१.२६७)

  

As it seems from the face value of the above quotation from Mahabharata, the purpose of Itihasa and Purana-s is to propound the theme of Veda-s (here it is plainly taken as to mean Vijnana and Vairagya) \[than to account for the history of the kings\]. I don't want to comment any more as it would draw undue arguments.

  

As per another reading वेदार्थमुपबृंहयेत्। बिभेत्यल्पश्रुताद् वेदो मामयं प्रहरिष्यति।

  

the reading of Purana-s and Itihaasa (Mahabharata) enlarges/reinstates the scope Vedic learning.
