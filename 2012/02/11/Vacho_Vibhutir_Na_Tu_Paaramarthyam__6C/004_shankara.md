Bhat Mahodaya,

  

Thanks for your kind reply. Could you please tell me, at least in a private mail (if you wish avoid controversy), whether "Vacho Vibhutir Na Tu Paaramarthyam" can mean that all the stories are merely fiction?  

  

A well known orator in Kerala recently interpreted this sloka to the effect that whole Bhagavata is only a fiction. I just wanted to get an expert opinion. Please help me.



regards  
shankara
