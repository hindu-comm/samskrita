At first reading the meaning that strikes me is roughly as follows:

"I have narrated to you these stories of the great who acquired fame and departed with a wish to inform you about the ultimate knowledge and an aversion to worldly pleasures. The splendour (wealth,grandeur)of words is not the ultimate." What is meant is: Story is not important , the moral of the story is.

Regards,

Murthy
