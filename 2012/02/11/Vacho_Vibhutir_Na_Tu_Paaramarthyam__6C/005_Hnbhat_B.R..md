Sorry for my hasty posting of the earlier message.

  

As it is, the dispute lies in the interpretation of पारमार्थ्य as the truth whether it is the Ultimate Truth (the purport of the Veda-s or Vedaanta) or the real account of facts of history. It is just like the Arthavada portions of the Veda-s and Upanishad-s as interpreted as arthavaada-s which are not consistent with their interpretation of the rest of the portion.

  

I have nothing to add. If you take the religious aspect and philosophical aspect as the main purpose of the composition of the पुराण-s one can interpret the word in his own way to defend the Ultimate Reality (सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म) or if one wants to take Purana-s as the poetical fancy of the poet/poets (ऐतिह्य) hearsay records, they are invented to expound the Ultimate Reality.
