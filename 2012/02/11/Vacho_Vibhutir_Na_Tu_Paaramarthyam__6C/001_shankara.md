Namaste!

  

Sloka given below is from Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.14

  

कथा इमास्ते कथिता महीयसाम् विताय लोकेषु यशः परेयुषाम्।  
विज्ञानवैराग्यविवक्षया विभो वचोविभूतिर्न तु पारमार्थ्यम्॥

  

Sukadeva Gosvami said: O mighty Pariksit, I have related to you the narrations of all these great kings, who spread their fame throughout the world and then departed. My real purpose was to teach transcendental knowledge and renunciation. Stories of kings lend power and opulence to these narrations but do not in themselves constitute the ultimate aspect of knowledge. (Its translation as given at <http://vedabase.net/sb/12/3/14/en2>).  
  
QUERY: Some scholars interpret the above sloka to mean that all the episodes described in the Bhagavata Purana are fiction. None of the incidents are real. They were made up by Sri Sukadeva/Vyasadeva. Is this interpretation correct as per Sanskrit grammar? Does "वचोविभूतिर्न तु पारमार्थ्यम्" mean that all these stories are creations of Sri Suka or Vyasa Maharshi?  
  
I request the learned members of this group to help me understand this sloka better.
