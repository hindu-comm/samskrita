The Apastamba Purva Prayoga document is in the "kalpa" folder of the skydrive. Note that this version is in kannada script only. This came from scribd, but the original link no longer renders properly.

  

The digital library of india also has the "apastamba grihya prayoga chandrika" in grantha script. I can upload the pdf to skydrive if anyone is interested in it. ( I generally don't upload documents in grantha script, since very few people can read them )

  

sasneham,

  

 ajit
