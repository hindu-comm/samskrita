It is downloadable in the lzipskydrive provided by Mr.Ajit. Only it requires to have a [live.com](http://live.com) account or [hotmail.com](http://hotmail.com) account. Otherwise audio is available for all the 8 chapters in the folder.

With regards  
  
Credits due to the original uploader "samskritapriya" and Mr.Ajit for giving the links here above in his message. Yousendit doesn't seems to require register with the site. In that case it is better to have it and the audio source also would be different than the one available here. There is another [wetransfer.com](http://wetransfer.com) where large files as of 2gb could be sent.
