namaste,

  

The digital library of india has several books from the bodhayana tradition. I'll upload them and send out a link in a few days time.

  

\(1\) bodhayana purva prayoga (in grantha script -- kerala tradition)

\(2\) kanakasabhapatiya bodhayana purva prayoga (in devanagari with swaras -- tamil nadu tradition)

\(3\) venkatesiya sanirnaya prayoga mala (in devanagari script, without any index -- karnataka tradition)

\(4\) bodhayana grihya sutras (mysore oriental series edition)

\(5\) bodhayana dharma sutras

  

sasneham,
