I have Third Sanskrit Course and Part I of Second Sanskrit Course written by Prof M S Gole, Principal Ferguson College, Pune. The books are of 1905 vintage. I would like to have First Sanskrit Course and Part II of Second Sanskrit Course of the series too (hard or soft copy). Will be grateful for any help.  
Regards,  
Murthy
