नमो नमः

  

\< There is not necessary to memorise the text. Amarakosha is there as a reference and you can refer to it whenever you want to.>

  

It may not be necessary for you, Vimala bhagini, in which case you needn't memorize it. But let's not underestimate the importance of knowing the Amarakosha by heart. It's not for nothing that this is a sine qua non for every Sanskrit student worth their mettle. This undertaking to memorize the Amarakosha is being carried out with the earnest belief that it will be a world of help to everyone who undertakes it.

  

Regards,
