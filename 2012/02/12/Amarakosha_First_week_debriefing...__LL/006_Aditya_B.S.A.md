नमो नमः

  

Dear Subrahmanya,

  

It has nothing to do with your poor memory. It's just the technique involved. If I might suggest what works for me, maybe you could experiment and see if it works for you, as well.

  

I already pointed out briefly in my previous post, and Ajit has put it in context as well, that repetition is the only way to commit things to your long-term memory.

  

Since we are not as lucky as the 10 year olds who studied at Mysore University, we must improvise. What they don't teach at Mysore University is the versatility of short term memory.

  

Consider the short term memory to be a scaffolding, which helps erect the structure of the twenty shlokas in your mind. Once it is erected, before removing the scaffolding altogether one must be confident that the structure is completely sturdy. That requires repetition.

  

The technique I use is as follows:

  

We started this effort on Thursday. Thursday and Friday were spent just repeating the shlokas, first one pada, next two padas. Needless to say, the lesser distractions the better while repeating. On Saturday, before repeating the full shloka, I picked up the rasala vyaakhyaa and read the meanings of the first 4 shlokas. There are twenty shlokas. Meanings of 4 shlokas per day (taking approximately half an hour/day), starting on Saturday, will have you complete the set on Wednesday.

  

Keeping a pen and pad, note down the meanings of the words. Like for example, 'nidhim guhyati iti guhyakah,' or 'paramE vyomani, chidakashe va vasati iti paramEshti.' After the meanings are written for each shloka, form associations to establish, first, the shloka, and then the order of the shlokas.

  

For example, first come the words describing svarga. Then come the words describing the residents of svarga, the amaras/devas. After describing the devas as whole, come the words describing the group-deities. The group-deities move around svarga in groups, hence they are cited next. (I know this is utter nonsense, but it helps me remember). Then come the lesser gods, who are like the working class of svarga. Then come the enemies of the residents of svarga, the asuras/daityas. They launch an assault on svarga. Buddha decides to come and sit in a secluded spot and watch the fun. While Buddha is sitting and observing this, Brahma becomes perturbed that svarga is in turmoil. He decides to approach Vishnu.

  

And there you have it, the order of the first twenty shlokas is established. This is only temporary, and by no means will this little story help you retain the material in your head, say, a month from now. But the point is that if you have it in your head today, you will repeat it (whatever portion you have learnt) at least 5 times. It takes a few minutes to repeat 4 or 5 shlokas. Once all twenty are in your head, say by Wednesday (as per schedule), you repeat the 20 once or twice everyday from Wednesday to Saturday. Then on Saturday start 'scaffoldizing' the next set. Then repeat the first set on alternate days, because you're learning a new set. Then 3 days once, when you're learning 3 sets. Then 4 days once. In that manner, once you've learnt Svargavarga, make sure that you repeat all the shlokas twice a week.

  

Even so they will not be retained in your long term memory. Repeating these shlokas twice a week for six months will ensure that the shlokas are sound in your memory, and then you can remove the scaffolding and move on. In this manner, when constructing the building of Amarakosha in your mind, you remove the scaffolding progressively from the foundation to the top.

  

Just like there are optimal ways to navigate a road bump or swim through water, I think the technique is of paramount importance, and learning at this pace is doable without much effort if one is inventive.

  

Regards,
