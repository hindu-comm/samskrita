नमो नमः

  

Sadagopan swami, that's great news! I hope you've downloaded the rasala vyaakhyaa from samskrita priya's skydrive. If you are able to make connections with the meanings of the words(roughly),from reading that vyaakhyaa, they are recognized in your short-term memory much faster. But, of course, for long term retention frequent repetitions are the only way.

  

If you're ready with the past week's set by Wednesday, we could skype and hear each other out. Let me know if it is possible.

  

I think it's of paramount importance that we keep up with the schedule because it generates a kind of momentum that will propel our effort further.

  

Regards,

  

BSA Aditya.
