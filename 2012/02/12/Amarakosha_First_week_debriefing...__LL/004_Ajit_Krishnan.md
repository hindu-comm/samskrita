namaste,

To put this in context, here are a couple of points from the paper  
"Primary Education in Sanskrit" (2002) which describes the methods  
used in Mysore Sanskrit College.

\(1\) At the age of ten, students study the amarakosha for one hour each day  
(2) Approximately 20 verses are memorized during each paksha (fortnight)  
(3) With \~18 fornights per academic year, it takes about 4 years

When memorizing texts, one is expected to repeat a selection more than  
100 times before it is fixed in memory. Moving on before then often  
means that the selection will be forgotten without constant follow-up  
practice.

sasneham,

 ajit
