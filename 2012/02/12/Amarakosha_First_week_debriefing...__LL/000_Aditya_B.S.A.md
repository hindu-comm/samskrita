नमो नमः

  

Now there are 3 videos up, and 3 sessions completed, wherein we've progressed from 1 pada to 2 padas and finally full shloka. Today's session will be the last for the first module of 20 shlokas (including the introductory four). These have to be learnt, by-heart, before the next class starts, next Thursday, i.e, 16th Feb.

  

Those who feel they can keep up with this schedule of learning 20 shlokas per week in a sustainable manner, kindly make your commitment known by addressing a mail to me. Going by the stats on the ustream page I'm sure this number will not be more than 5 or 6, and we can schedule a con-call between these members wherein each one recites what they've learnt, and is checked by another (we schedule this so that it takes no more than 15 mins of each person's time on a given day, after we figure out who will check who for the week). The point of doing this is solely for motivation.

  

I had mentioned that I would provide the link to the rasala vyaakhya. You can find it in the amara directory of the skydrive of 'samskrita priya.' ([www.tinyurl.com/samskritam](http://www.tinyurl.com/samskritam))

  

My heartfelt thanks to whoever this is for sharing so many resources on the web. A great, great service to Sanskrit students worldwide.

  

Coming back to the topic, the d-day for completing Svargavarga is March 8th. Let's keep it going!

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः
