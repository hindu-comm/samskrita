I am sure that learning Amarakosha by heart of great beneft and you are doing an excellent job. But I cannot memorise it and trying to do so will take up too much time (for me!). There are also other texts that ideally should be learnt by heart - shiva sUtrani and aSTadhyayi and dhatupAtha, etc. Perhaps I am not ready for memorising texts which can be referred to. I admire the students who can memorise things quickly.
I like your story on remembering the order of slokas.
