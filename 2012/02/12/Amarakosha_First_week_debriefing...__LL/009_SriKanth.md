On memorizing slokas, Let me add one wonderful, time-tested, simple  
technique for sustaining the shlokas in mind.  
This has been used for hundreds of years and is the most successful  
method.  
  
In Tamil, for memorizing Naalaayira Divya Prabhandham (4000 tamil  
devine songs) they use something called "Adivaravu" (don't know how to  
translate this in English).  
  
The idea is they will collect the first words of the stanzas and keep  
them separate. This will be 10 or 15 words at max. While reciting  
thousands of the devine songs, simply a look at the adivaravu they can  
bring the whole stanza from memory. Mostly people will memorize the  
simple adivaravu also; so in ghosti paaraayanam, if someone forgot  
whats the next song, they simply recite the Adivaravu and can bring  
the forgotten one to memory.  
  
Same way in Amarakosha also, I have written down the first words of 20  
shlokas learnt this week separately in a paper. Now simply by looking  
at the very first words, I could recite the full shloka. This helps in  
keeping the order. Sometimes same word appears in different places and  
we might lose track and jump shlokas. By having the order of shlokas  
in hand, I could verify I am following the path right.  
  
Hope this helps.  
- Srikanth.
