Namaskar.

\> For example, first come the words describing svarga. Then come the words  
\> describing the residents of svarga, the amaras/devas. After describing the  
\> devas as whole, come the words describing the group-deities. The  
\> group-deities move around svarga in groups, hence they are cited next. (I  
\> know this is utter nonsense, but it helps me remember). Then come the  
\> lesser gods, who are like the working class of svarga. Then come the  
\> enemies of the residents of svarga, the asuras/daityas. They launch an  
\> assault on svarga. Buddha decides to come and sit in a secluded spot and  
\> watch the fun. While Buddha is sitting and observing this, Brahma becomes  
\> perturbed that svarga is in turmoil. He decides to approach Vishnu.

I am happy to note this post. This gives the benefits of memorisation  
in a very exemplary way. Earlier when students memorised, it  
established links between various memory units in their brain.  
Later on we started relying on the printed material which is more  
like a secondary memory and naturally it has all the disadvantages.  
For example the nice knowledge structure that evolves in the mind of a  
person memorising the kosha is totally absent in the mind of a person  
who uses only the printed version.  
At the most what he can do is refer to the index and search a given  
word. But he totally misses the structure unless he puts in special  
efforts to study it consciously with the help of commentaries.  
  
Given the fact that there is an internal structure to such koshas  
which is not explicit, the commentators or the teachers make such  
structures explicit while commenting upon / teaching.  
  
In an effort to make such an implicit structure explicit, my student  
Dr. Shivaja Nair had undertaken a study of Amarakosha as a sample,  
she marked various relations between consecutive words in the  
Amarakosha such as synonym, janya-janaka, pati-patni, sevya-sevaka,  
AjIvikA, aparAjAti-parAjAti, avayava-avayavI, etc. She also tried to  
extend the Vaisheshika ontology further so as to classify the words  
into different categories.  
  
Thus given a word, and a relation, machine displays the relevant  
information, with a reference to kaa.n.da, paada, varga, shloka and  
gender for each of the word.  
  
The interface is available at <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/amarakosha/frame.html>  
  
Those who would like to have a pictorial view of various relations  
corresponding to a given word, try 'all relations' option.  
For example with 'विष्णु' and 'all relations' options, you get a graph  
showing the linkages with various nodes.  
  
(In one of the earlier posts, Dr. H N Bhat had pointed out some  
mistakes in the data, we will be fixing them. )  
  
Similar work for other koshas can be taken up.  
  
Finally, I would like to emphasise that the computer aids are not  
substitutes for memorisation, but are tools for those who find it  
difficult to memorise at an advanced age.  
  
With regards,  
Amba kulkarni
