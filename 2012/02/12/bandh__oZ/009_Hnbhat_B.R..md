Again it is not clear for me. You asked about the table of Dhatu-s and I gave the information and I pasted it from the scanned book available online.

  

If you are asking how I typed the rest of my message in Devanagari text, I used Baraha IME for typing the text.

  

And if your question is related to the rest part of the precise answer to his question is based on the standard Sanskrit grammar of Panini I had learnt and my knowledge of it. It is not culled out from any page on the web and not any verb generator or noun declension tools available online. There are many of them listed in this forum in earlier messages and also software list to type in Devanagari in different messages. IF you search, you also will get it.

  

Hope now my answer is clear to you.
