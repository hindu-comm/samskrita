I didn't expect this question from you who had endeavored to design a web page for Ramayana yourself.

  

Anybody can see the hyper links in the pasted portion leads to the pages numbered in the scan page available online which itself gives the details.

  

If you can go to any page hyper linked in the page numbers, you can see the other pages and more details of the book including a preface which should be able to give more details of the author and the book.

  

Anyhow, for your information, the book Madhaviya Dhatuvritti published long long ago and written by Madhava or the brother Sayana Madhava,
who authored many more works including his comprehensive Commentary on 4 Veda-s during 14th century and who is the founder inspiration for the establishment of कर्णाटकमहासिंहासन. 



If you know English or Hindi you can read more about him in this link:

Also you can read in Hindi more about the brothers Sayana and Madhava:
