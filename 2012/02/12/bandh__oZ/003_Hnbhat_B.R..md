Here is a pun with the form bandhum =

  

***बन्धुमिच्छति***यमेव सज्जनस्तं भवन्तमयि **बन्धुमिच्छती ।**

सा नियु/ज्य रशनागुणान् बहून् द्व्यङ्गुलोनमखिलं किलैक्षत ॥७॥

  

बन्धुम्-इच्छति as a relative,(they) desire

यम्-एव सज्जन:- him alone , the good people (virtuous persons - devotees)

तं भवन्तम्-अयि That Thee O Lord!

बन्धुम्-इच्छती to tie desiring

सा नियुज्य she using (tying together)

रशना-गुणान् बहून् pieces of rope, many

द्व्यङ्गुल-ऊनम्- by two fingers (long), short

अखिलं the whole length

किल-ऐक्षत indeed found

All good men want to bind themselves to Thee alone in devotion. That Thou O Lord! Yashodaa desiring to tie, found the length of the rope short by two fingers, even though she attached many pieces of ropes to lengthen it.
