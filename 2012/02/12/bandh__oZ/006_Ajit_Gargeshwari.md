Dear Ramma,  
  

'I was wondering how did you get nice Dhatu table? is it some standard reference or your own work?

I would appreciate your help"

  

  
I always do a good google search before raising questions. I also click on the links and hyperlinks provided in answers. A search within threads of this group will provide one with basic resources to learn Sanskrit. A little knowledge of primary texts in Sanskrit or in translations might be useful. Hope this elementary procedure will help.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
