Shaankara Vijnaana Vybhavam at Bangalore

Namaste All,

We have a group of persons pursuing diverse types of careers but  
deeply interested in Vedanta. They may be scientists, technologists,  
doctors etc.. but the element of mumukshatva in them has attracted  
them towards study of philosophy to understand the truth.This has led  
them to the light shown by Adi Shankara and his exposition of Vedanta.

A group of such persons have collectively proposed to have a programme  
organised to have a thorough and in depth view of the Siddhanta with  
the help of eminent Sanyasis and Vedantic scholors. The above  
programme is organised as part of Shankara Jayanthi from 10th May  
2012 to 12th May for the benefit of mumukshus only.
