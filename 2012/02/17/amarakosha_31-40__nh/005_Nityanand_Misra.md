Though he may be right at places, Itend to not trust Devadutt Pattanaik's work as a reliable source, and take him with several kilos of salt. Granted he is a bestselling author, but thats it. The very fact that the web page mentions vehicle of Ganga as dolphin (?) and not crocodile (makara) as seen in traditional paintings lowers the credibility of the article. He refers not to original Sanskrit texts, Khushwant Singh, who is another best seller but like Pattanaik or Wendy Doniger, can hardly be counted as an authority on Puranic texts or Hindu iconography. So I would always double check before taking these authors on face value.

  

Some of the stuff below (Balram drinking, having his way with Yamuna, et cetera) sounds like mental regurgitation and is sickening. Much like many of Doniger's readings into Hinduism.
