Here is the information related to Yamuna alias Kalindi, related to Balarama culled out of a web page dedicated to Yamuna:

>   
> Yamuna is visualized as a mournful, melancholy, dark goddess riding a > turtle, quite totally unlike her bubbly and cheerful sister Ganga > whose waters are white and who rides a dolphin. She is the embodiment > of Radha, pining for her lost beloved. It is said that when > Indraprastha was built Yamuna did not flow by its side. She forced her > way towards the city after an unfortunate encounter with Balarama.  
> Krishna’s brother Balarama, who was paying a visit to the area long > after Krishna had moved to Dwarka, felt like bathing in the river. But > he was too drunk and too tired to walk to the river. He ordered Yamuna > to come to her. She refused. Enraged, Balarama, raised his plough and > dragged the river-goddess towards him. Khushwant Singh, in his book > Delhi narrates the folk version according to which Balarama dragged > Yamuna by the hair and had his way with her. Her struggles gave rise > to the many bends of the river around Delhi. The story according to > some anthropologists is suggestive of canal irrigation by the Surasena > tribe. Balarama with his plough was their god of agriculture while > Krishna with his cows was their god of animal husbandry; together they > were the gods of the primary economic activities of a civilization > that according to archaeologists thrived as early as 600 BC.  
> After being dragged to Indraprastha, Yamuna begged Krishna to make her > his wife. Without him, no one cared for her. Nobody respected her. As > Kalindi, she became one of Krishna’s eight principal wives. But he > left her to flow in Vraj while he ruled far away in the island city of > Dwarka. Still she waits for him. Hoping that Dwarka-pati, the > Mathura-Nagar-Pati, will come back to Gokul. She hopes for the magic > of the moonlight. The romance of the flute. The secret dance of Radha > and the milkmaids. It is said that no man may join this dance. Shiva > wanted to join it. Arjuna wanted to join it. Yamuna asked them to > bathe in her, shed their masculinity, become women and dance with > Krishna accepting them, as she did, as their supreme lord.

  

  

Here is the complete information link which gives additional information on the episode from different source too:

  

<http://devdutt.com/by-the-banks-of-the-yamuna/>

  

These episodes should be traced to Bhagavata Purana itself 10.65, This diversion of the route of Kalindi, is reflected by the epithet of Balarama, as कालिन्दीभेदन, or कालिन्दीकर्षण.

  

There may be other sources also.
