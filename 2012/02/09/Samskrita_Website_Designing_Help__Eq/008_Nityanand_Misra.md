What format do you have the shlokas in? Have you already typed them in Devanagari? If not then you should be able to find the English transliteration at Digital Corpus of Sanskrit by searching for keywords, which you can convert to Devnagari using many tools like <http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/transkription-tool/>  
  
If you have them in Devnagari already, you can convert to IAST at <http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/transkription-tool/> as well.  
  
Google Labs had a tool sometime back to transliterate Devnagari text to other Indian languages which I had used to convert some Nagari text to Gujarati script. They no longer have it.
