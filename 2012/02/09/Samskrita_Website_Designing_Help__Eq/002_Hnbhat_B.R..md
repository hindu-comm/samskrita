Welcome to the creation of a new website dedicated to ValmikiRamayana. A Similiar one with audio, commentaries and translation, original text is already in progress for long:(some commentaries are already have completed data for whole kaanda-s only one or two are remaining to be completed.)

  

[Valmiki Ramayan - INTRODUCTION](http://valmiki.iitk.ac.in/index.php?id=introduction)

  

Another one with translation, word by word anvaya etc. is also available online:

Best wishes
