Upendra,

Thanks for the encouragement, honestly I did not like the way they presented the data. Its very slow.

I wanted to create it because I have all the content to create but lack the skill for good data organization.

I am talking to website designer if required I will hire a professional to create the templates and later fill the data.

Lets see how that effort goes.

  

Raama
