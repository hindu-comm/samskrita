Raama,  

Raamaayanam, and that too with explanations from various perspectives is going to consume thousands of pages and a lot of disk space, hence i would advise you to go with some CMS like drupal or joomla than writing your own web app. Also, don't try to write each page in html but create a LATEX, XML or some other template and upload the content into database which can be utilized by these cms to generate a web page dynamically. Store your content in database which offers more reliability and tools for backup and restore, etc. apache also works faster when it can fetch the data from the database rather than finding one of the thousands of files in the file system. CMS would help you manage the site more peacefully in the long run.
