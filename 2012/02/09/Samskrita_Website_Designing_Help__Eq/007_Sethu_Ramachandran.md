Dear all,  
GREETINGS.  
Thanks for all the points raised here and the worthy answers received.  
I have been requested to prepare a set of select slokas of Srimad.Vamiki Ramayana,  
in sanskrit with transliteration in English and in Tami along with meaning either in  
English or in Tamil. My Guruji has selected nearly 400 verses in sanskrit and  
I have to do the rest of the job. can anyone help me in getting the details of the site from transliteration  
for these slokas in English & in Tamil. This is intended for Ramayana Dyanam.  
Thanks,  
Sethu.R
