Dear Rama,  
  
Kudos to a great idea. Since the volume of the work is not small, any attempt to do in HTML directly would be error prone and very tough. I suggest the following -  
  
1. Create a HTML template for a shloka - like the picture you have shared. templatize this using xml or equivalent. The idea is that the raw content typed into an xml file (or others) can be auto converted in to webpages with all the formatting.  
  
2. Create / Use a UI application for typing in the content, which can take the user input and convert to the intermediate form, the xml file.  
  
This way, we end up spending some time upfront on the templates, but will spend almost zero time on the actual webpages, look and feel, and consistency.  
  
Hope this helps, Let me know if I have not understood you correctly,  
  
Thanks  
Viswanath
