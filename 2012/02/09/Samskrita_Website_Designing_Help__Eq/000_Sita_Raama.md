Namaste,

I am thinking to create an exclusive website for Valmiki Ramayanam. I am attaching my thoughts about the website on a page along with first chapter on Ramayanam.

  

I did not write the text, I took the permission Late Desiraju Hanumanta Raogaru who created this site.<http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/baala/sarga1/bala_1_frame.htm>

However there are many typos and the "Pratipadartha" is in english instead of devangari.

  

For those who arewonderinghow did i create the pdf, then I painstakinglyreformattedit in LaTeX.

  

I want to present this text along with, Rama, Tilaka and Govindaraja tika for each verse for all the 6 volumes of Shri Valmiki Ramayanam.

  

It may take years. Years is what I have, what I don't have is the technical expertise to create a good website like this.<http://nakula.learnsanskrit.org/texts>

  

Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.

regards
