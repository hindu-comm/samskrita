Hello All,

I would like it if the community can create some archive out in the open internet rather than under IIT to hold such a valuable research/ presentation.

I seriously doubt if we can leave it to the decisions of the govts.who may suddenly decide that this is talking about hindu religious figures and cut the grant(if this is under a grant) or simply close it off.
