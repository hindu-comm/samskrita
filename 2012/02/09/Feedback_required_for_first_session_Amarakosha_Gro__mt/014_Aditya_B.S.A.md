नमो नमः

  

Dear Subramanya,

  

The primary intention is to memorize the shlokas.

  

Subsequently, with every module of 20 shlokas learnt, there will be a session where the words are listed separately along with the corresponding linga of each. I'm not sure of the extent to which etymology is important from an applicability perspective. Since I'm a beginner myself, I don't have the expertise required to elucidate the etymology in detail.

  

However, reading the vyaakhyaa throws up some very interesting points that can make the words stick in your head, like for example, for the word त्रिदशाः -

However, deriving the word, pratyayas, samasas, et al, is an exercise in itself, which could be undertaken by individuals depending on their level of interest. For now, I will try to glean sentences like the above from a quick reading of the vyaakhyaa and share it with the group.

  

If anyone is interested in sharing their knowledge about the vyutpatti of the padas and can spare time over weekends or something, that would be great.

  

Regards,

  

BSA Aditya.
