Dear Adityaji ,  
  
It was a good experience. The voice quality was quite good , while the video was not so very good . Perhaps that is not required as well , as long as we can clearly hear the words , that were very well pronounced . Thanks a lot for the same .  
  
Is there any book where the explanation of the shlokas is available , so that it helps in clearing the doubt with the meanings  
  
Secondly , it is good to know that , each session , will be available in the archive also , since , I may not be able to join today during 8.30 p m to 9 , so I can watch it tomorrow ?  
  
Thanks a lot for your efforts  
  
regards  
  
Dipak ashar
