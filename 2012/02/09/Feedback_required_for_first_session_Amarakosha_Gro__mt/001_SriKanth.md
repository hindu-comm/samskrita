Dear Aditya mahodaya,  
  
I missed the timing by an hour but thanks to the technology, I could  
see the archived video. The first session was wonderful. Perfect  
timing in reciting the shlokas. I felt, without the book, if I just  
listen and recite with you, it was easier.  
  
Tomorrow I will join at the right time.  
  
dhanyavada  
Srikanth.
