Dear Aditya Mahodaya,  
  
I had been away for the past month.. Only today i noticed the mails regarding this study group. Something like this was exactly what I was looking for, and had made such a request to the group also, a few months back! I listened to the recorded video of the first session today.  
  
I have subscribed to the channel, but I may not be able to make it for every session since several times I work in field and dont have internet access at the stipulated time. Still, I shall try to make it as far as possible. Thank you so much for uploading the videos.  
  
The recording voice quality is very good. The mp3 of the original recording is also very nice.  
  
praNAm,  
Jaideep
