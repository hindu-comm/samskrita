नमो नमः

  

I hope whoever logged in was able to hear and repeat along. I definitely didn't expect to be broadcasting with video but when I logged in half an hour before and checked with a friend the audio only broadcast option didn't seem to work (though it had worked on previous occasion), so I had no choice. I will try to figure out how to make it audio only.

  

In the meantime, any feedback from those who were in the session would be appreciated. We've hit the ground running, and let's keep up the momentum.

  

I was a little rusty with mySanskritand was kinda jittery because I was looking at many things at once, though I'm sure that as the classes go on we'll get more comfortable.

  

Whatever you have to say, good, bad, or ugly, please say it here. Remember, this week, we have 20 shlokas to learn.

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः

  

p.s - I just made the video available to the crowd on the ustream page. Those who missed the live session can go check it out there.
