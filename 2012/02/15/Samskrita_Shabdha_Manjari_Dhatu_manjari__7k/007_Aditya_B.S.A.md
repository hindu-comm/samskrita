नमो नमः

  

Dear Dario,

  

The book by Vidwan Mahabaleshwar Bhatt is titled 'कारकम्'. It is in Sanskrit. The tingantasiddhih dvds contain the lectures of Vidushi Pusha Dikshita in Sanskrit, and so presuppose functional comprehension of the language. The lectures are broadly divided into two categories. सार्वधातुकलकाराः and आर्धधातुकलकाराः. She explains briefly (identifying common patterns) the forms of dhaatus belonging to all 10 groups, first in the former category, then the latter.
