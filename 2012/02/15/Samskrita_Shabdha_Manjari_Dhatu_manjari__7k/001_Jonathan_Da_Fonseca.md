***Let me see if I can give you a sample of the method we use in my community.  
Use the ways you normally walk. For instance from your home to work.  
Interior of your house  
The door of your house  
the street of your house  
a establishment in the stree  
an office post  
etc.  
select successive points from house to your job. If are enough points easily you can get twenty fix points.  
By giantism or by humorism visualize each, for instance, dhatu to each place. Observe that for to say twenty you just need mentally to go from home to work and the other way around you will be able to say all in inverse order. Now is just to select more ways able to have twenty easily identifiable points. Always make in groups of twenty.  
  
For me works.
