One method which I use to memorise what i want to is to record the  
thing to be memorised and listen to it even while doing some other  
works. One could also recite along with the recordings. It has done  
wonders to me. I was able to memorise in this fashion kiratharjuneeyam  
second sarga and some many other important slokas for one of my  
sanskrit exams.

Regards

Rajagopalan
