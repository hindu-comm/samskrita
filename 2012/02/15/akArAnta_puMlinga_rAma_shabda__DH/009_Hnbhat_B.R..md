Please give the reference to the "Sutra" you are referring. I\* don't remember any such rule of Panini. Only there is a maximum naapi kevalaa prakRutiH prayoktavyaa, naapi pratyayaH" usually quoted. Arthavad - dhaatur apratyayaH praatipadikam" and kRittaddhitasamaasaash ca" are the two rules governing the technical terms of "praatipadika" which excludes any meaningful string, except dhaatu, and pratyaya-s which is summarized by the above maximum. And praatipadikam is not translated as root, but as stem, specifically nominal stem.  
  
This my understanding. I don't know how do you arrive at the above conclusion  

> names should always be Vocative Singular  

> --  

  
There is no such rule I can remember.
