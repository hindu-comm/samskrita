As per my understanding names should always be Vocative Singular. Pratipadikam (Root) is not a padam until it associates itself with subanta or tinganta. Raam is not a padam until it gets attached to sup etc. Once it attaches then only it becomes pada.  
There is a sutra "apadam na prayunjita"  
  
others can comment on my understanding as well.
