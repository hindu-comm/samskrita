Hi,  
  
This is probably a bit unrelated - but by convention, are people given  
names according to the nominal root, the nominative singular case or  
the vocative singular ? eg  
  
1. aśvin (noun root and voc singular) and aśvī (nom singular)  
2. ṛtvij (noun root) or ṛtvik (nom singular and voc singular)  
  
I think it should be vocative singular, but not sure.
