There seems something more in the verse. as the translation or notes is missing on the above highlighted lines in the first two:

  

कसितकुवलया - कसितानि विकसितानि कुवलयानि यस्यां सा

  

Here apparent  विरोधाभास in the first line and the second line.

  
कञ्जतल्पालिमाला - भँवरसमूहों के कमलों में शयन करने के कारण  

  

As explained, above. The translation is missing for the first lines. Obviously, the first makes it कसितानि कुवलयानि - lilies and the next makes sense in this much that the mass of lilies are blossomed in the राका night and the lotuses कञ्जतल्प makes the bed for the अलि-s by closing the lotuses अलि-s inside them. But with this translation, it would make a repetition of the first line in the line just commented by Mr. Mishra.

  

कुमुदितकुमुदा - कौ पृथिव्यां मुदितानि कुमुदानि यस्यां सा कुमुदितकुमुदा

  

which again makes the lilies blossomed on the surface of the earth in the राका शर्वरी a second time. To avoid this, better in the first, to make the interpretation in the first, as कसितं - हृष्टम्, कोः - पृथिव्याः, वलयं यया सा, इति राकाविशेषणम्। This is one way. Mr. Mishra may have some other explanation.

  

"स्यादुत्पलं कुवलयम्" इति सामान्येन कमलकुमुदादीनां सामान्येनाभिधानात्,

  

अथ नीलाम्बुजन्म च।

इन्दीवरं च नीलेऽस्मिन् सिते कुमुदकैरवे॥

  

इति अमरकोशात्। 

  

The general poetic convention is that the lotuses blossom in the day break and the lilies close, and the lilies blossom in the nightfall and close in the daybreak. Hence the epithet of moon "इन्दुः कुमुदबान्धवः"
and the epithet used "पद्मिनीवल्लभः" for the sun.

This is the basis for the closure of the lotus and blossoming of the lilies during the full moon night described.

  

Hope we can get more explanation in this direction from Mr. Mishra. I just noted what I noticed in the beautiful verse.

  

  

Thanks for both his guru and him for providing a beautiful verse.
