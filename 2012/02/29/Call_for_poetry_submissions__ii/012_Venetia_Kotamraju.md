Namaste Dr Bhat,

Thank you very much for your two verses - the one comparing the night to a kapalika is very unusual, I enjoyed it a lot. They have been posted here: <http://www.rasalabooks.com/>the-anthology/ and you can follow the progress of your verses and others submitted by checking this page, or by signing up for our mailing list (for that either email me off list or sign up to the verse of the week here:
<http://www.rasalabooks.com/verse-of-the-week/>). 

Best

Venetia
