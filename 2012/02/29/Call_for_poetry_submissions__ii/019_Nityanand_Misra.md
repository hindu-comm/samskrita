The प्रातिपदिक कु means the earth - both Apte's and Monier Williams' dictionaries have this meaning. Consequently, कुपुत्र or कुज means the planet Mars. Here is the entry from M-W.  
  
कु  
(H1) कु 1 \[p= 285,3\] \[L=50905\]  a pronom. base appearing in क्/उतस् , क्/उत्र , कुव्/इद् , क्/उह , क्व्/अ , and as a prefix implying deterioration , depreciation , deficiency , want , littleness , hindrance , reproach , contempt , guilt  
\[L=50905.1\]  originally perhaps कु signified " how (strange!) "  
\[L=50905.2\]  as a separate word कु occurs only in the lengthened form 3. क्/ऊ q.v.  
(H1) कु 2 \[p= 286,3\] \[L=51238\]  f. the earth A1ryabh. VarBr2S. VarBr2. BhP. vi , 1 , 42  
\[L=51239\]  the ground or base of a triangle or other plane figure , Comm. on A1ryabh.  
\[L=51240\]  the number " one. "  
(H1) कु 3 \[L=51269\]  » √1. कू.  
(H2) कु \[p= 1324,3\] \[L=328060\]  (in comp.)  
  
Furthermore, Apte gives the व्युत्पत्ति of कुमुद as कौ (locative form of कु) मोदते इति कुमुदम्.  
  
If the first syllable is from क = water, the word would be कमुदितकुमुदा (with the विग्रह as के जले मुदितानि कुमुदानि यस्याम्) and not कुमुदितकुमुदा (which has the विग्रह as कौ पृथिव्यां मुदितानि कुमुदानि यस्याम्). Both forms preserve the meter and both make sense. जल and पृथिवी have the अवयवावयविसंबंध - so "the water lilies on the surface of the earth" implies "the water lilies in water bodies on the surface of the earth". In English this usage is known as the Synecdoche figure of speech (specifically *totum pro parte*, or using something to refer to a part of it), I do not know the Samskrit term for the same.  
  
Having said that, I am sure the composer said कुमुदितकुमुदा and explained it as कौ पृथिव्यां मुदितानि कुमुदानि यस्याम्.
