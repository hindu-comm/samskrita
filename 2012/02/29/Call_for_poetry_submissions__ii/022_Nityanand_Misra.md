Dear Dr. Bhat  
  
I believe the word कुवलय is used here for the "blue water-lily" (species *Nymphaea stellata L.*, shown [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_water_lilly_flower.jpg)), while the word कुमुद is used for the "white water-lily" (species *Nymphaea pubescens L.*, shown [here)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nymphaea_pubescens1MTFL.jpg). Apte and Monier Williams both confirm this. There is a post by Venetia on water lilies in Samskrita litearature which notes this distinction -  
  
<http://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/water-lilies/>  
  
I think even the verse you pointed Amarkosha makes the distinction as it uses सित (white) as a qualifier for कुमुद and कैरव.  
  
The two flowers कुवलय and कुमुद, though belonging to the same genus, are different species and both bloom at the night. I therefore do not see any repetition - the first quarter refers to the blue lily flowers and the second refers to the white ones.  
  
To double confirm, I reheard the voice recording of the session in which the Guru was explaining the verse. He explained कसितकुवलया in Hindi as "रात्रि के कमल जिसमें खिले हुए हैं" - which makes it clear that the flower referred to was indeed *Nymphaea pubescens L*., or the blue water-lily (also called the blue lotus in English and नीलकमल in Hindi). As you may already know, some lily species in the *Nymphaea* genus are called lotus in common parlance, though strictly speaking lotuses are flowers of the *Nelumbo* genus.  
  
Regarding your alternate parsing of कसितकुवलया, it could be a possibility. Interestingly, the व्युत्पत्ति of कुवलयम् is कौ वलयमिव. If कसितकुवलया is alternately interpreted as you have pointed out, then this is another instance of श्लेष figure of speech apart from शर्वरीशंवृणोति.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
