Dear Madam, Yes. You can see it on the net here in Uttara Megha asNo.29 in this site:

  

<http://nakula.learnsanskrit.org/translations-corresp/meghaduta-wilson/uttaramegha/26-30>

  

The numbers may change due to different editions and in some one may not be able to find. It is available in many blog sites on the net with different numbers. But the verse is there though they have not mentioned the editions they have used.

  

With regards
