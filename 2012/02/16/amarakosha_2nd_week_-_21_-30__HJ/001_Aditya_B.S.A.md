नमो नमः

  

I have the same doubt here... can someone please explain the derivation of the name 'अधोक्षजः'?

  

आदित्यः

  

p.s - for those who're learning the Amarakosha... according to schedule you should've gone through the first 4 shlokas of this set of 20 in detail today. It took no more than 30 mins. Hope you can spare the time.
