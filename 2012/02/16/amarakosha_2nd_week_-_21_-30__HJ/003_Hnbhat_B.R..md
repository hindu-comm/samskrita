Here is the derivation of the word Mukunda meaning विष्णु:

I too could not get the Puranic episode leading to this epithet. I know such a story, but could not locate it on the net.

  

<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte>

  

In the link there is interesting derivations of the epithets of Vishnu. The definition given for the above word is:

  

|                                                        | |--------------------------------------------------------| | adho na kṣīyate jātu yasmāt tasmād adhokṣajaḥ / (10.1) |

  

from Mahabharata.

  

May be in some Shaivapurana-s or Lingapurana, there is such a story. On search I found a similar story that Vishnu entered the stomach of Brahma and emerged out through his mouth. The story I heard was he emerged out of the adhoksha- excretory organ "paayu" and not "paada" as given in the version of Sarvananda. Lingapurana has the story.

  

<http://www.scribd.com/doc/61506110/5/Brahma-and-Vishnu>

  

  

May be the version of Sarvananda had "paada" as the adhaH indriya - the lower organ. The name adhokshaja equally applied in both cases, but not to the story given in the above link, as mouth is not the adho'ksha. but the mukha main indriya.

  



I am looking for more sources to affirm my version of the story.
