One of the meanings of सम is an even number.

  

One of the meanings ofविषम is an odd number.

  

There would be several references foe this. Tulsidas calls Kaamadeva asबिषमसर (Prakrit for विषमशर) at one place since he has five arrows, which is an odd number. In one of my poems, I used the wordसमेतरेषु for Kaamadeva.
