Namaste to one and all!

  

I recently came across the word 'ओज' with meaning as above. I read it as a Sanskrit term for 'odd numbers'. Could members of the group please let me know about the 'significance' of odd numbers? Is there a term for 'even numbers'? (I have come across a series of odd numbers inचमकम्(1 to 33). Also, this series isfollowed by multiples of 4 (4 to 48).)

  

Information, or, pointers to information, will be much appreciated.

  

Thanks in advance,

  

Vidya
