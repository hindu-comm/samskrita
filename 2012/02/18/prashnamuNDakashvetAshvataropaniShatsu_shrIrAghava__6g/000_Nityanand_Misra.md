Namaste  
  

Scanned copies of the Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam commentaries on the Praśnopaniṣad, Muṇḍakopaniṣad and Śvetāśvataropaniṣad are now available for free download. These are bilingual commentaries in Sanskrit and Hindi by Jagadguru Rāmabhadrācārya on the six questions, the three Muṇḍakas and the six chapters, respectively, of the Praśna, Muṇḍaka and Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad. The commentaries were originally released by Sh. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India, on April 5, 1998, along with commentaries on the Brahma Sūtra (about which I had posted on the group two months ago), Bhagavadgītā and eight other Upaniṣads. The current versions of the books were published in 2000 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas.
