Thanks for the commentary of Sankara and its sub commentary.

  

The sub commentator had to strive hard to defend the commentary as literary meaning for the adjective with the reading @धृक् - धृषे

and needs some more explanation with the dative case explanation of the compound महाद्रये धृष्णोति इति \*धृक् -

which is better explanation. As explained in my previous post, the proper word with the suffix क्विन् from the same root approved by Panini is दधृक्. With the reading \*धृत् so much explanation is not needed at all. In Geeta Press edition of the bhashya, it was clearly marked as

षान्तो ऽयम्, which confirms the reading to be \*धृक् as explained by the sub commentator, कवर्गान्तपाठ.
