Has anyone successfully configured (unrooted) Android device to view  
posts on this newsgroups?  
  
The problem is the apparent inability to add/use fonts that have  
glyphs for Devanagari, and lack of rendering support for it. If I can  
use a font that has Roman transliteration glyphs (so that the  
rendering always left-to-right), that would be enough. Chrome for  
Android is supposed to be able to do that, but the font issue seems to  
remain.  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
Nath
