You can install Hindi font in Android (without rooting) by installing Hinkhoj dictionary from Android Market.

  

Android 4.0 has Hindi font by default but it still lacks CTL (Complex Text Layout) engine support due to which Hindi is not displayed properly. Good news is that the web browser of 4.0 displays Hindi properly.
