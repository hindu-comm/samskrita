Namaste All,

If any one has information or scanned copies of (Dharma Shastra) works  
edited by Jagannath Raghunath Gharpure, please do share.

For starters, Gharpure JR Gharpure, edited many Dharmashastra Nibandha  
Granthas, Digests on Dharmashastra so to say; under the heading "Hindu  
Law texts" or something similar. These books were mostly printed at  
the Poona Law (Journal/College ?) Press.

Works that I atleast know are as follows  
Smriti Muktaphalam of Sri Vaidyanatha Dikshita (in 5 vols)  
Smritichandrika of Devanna Bhatta (Sanskrit text along with English  
Translation to some parts?)  
Bhagavanta Bhaskara of Nilakantha (Chaturdhara?).

To the best of my knowledge these editions represent finely edited  
specimens of the works in Devanagari. The Smriti Muktaphalam is  
available on the Digital Library of India and is probably the only  
extant edition (in Devanagari) other than the finely edited version in  
Grantha script along with a Tamil translation by Vidwan BrahmaSri  
Srinavasa Shastri of Kumbhaghonam, published in the early 20th  
Century.

If anyone has more information on the edited / compiled works of J. R.  
Gharpure, sharing them would be indeed useful.

Thank you.
