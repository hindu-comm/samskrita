If you enter search term in the 'Author' field as 'Gharpure' in the  
DLI website <http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/>, you will notice 11 books by  
JR Gharpure on Hindu Law. You could download any of them through the  
DLI Downloader software, available for free on the internet.  
  
Besides, I found the following at [archive.org](http://archive.org):  
  
<http://www.archive.org/details/hindulaw00ghar> (An English book Hindu  
Law by GR Gharpure),  
<http://www.archive.org/details/smritichandrika015336mbp>  
(Smritichandrika by DevaNa BhaTTa, published by the Mysore State).  
  
[books.google.com](http://books.google.com) and several libraries have GR Gharpure's books but  
they will have to be purchased.  
  
(An aside: GR Gharpure was a prominent lawyer, practicing in the  
Bombay High Court in the early 20th century, a founding member of the  
Indian Law Society (1924) and the first principal of the famous Law  
College, Poona. He was also associated with the Bhandarkar Oriental  
Research Institute and its President for some time.)
