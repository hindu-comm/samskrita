DearDr. AnilKumar,



Congratulations!



The Vivaha Samskaras which lay the foundation for a happy married life have a great social relevance and I am so very happy that you chose this subject for obtaining your Doctoral Degree.



If your thesis is available on the net, it will be interesting to read the same.



With best regards, and wishing that your studies take you to many such socially relevant spheres,



Sincerely,

Satyajit
