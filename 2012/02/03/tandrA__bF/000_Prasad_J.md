Namaste,



I was reading a description of different yuga from Bhāgavata Purāṇa and came across this verse:

12.3.30

yadā māyānṛtaṁ tandrā

nidrā hiṁsā viṣādanam

śoka-mohau bhayaṁ dainyaṁ

sa kalis tāmasaḥ smṛtaḥ

This is the description of Kali-yuga and in this ‘tandrā’ word is used. I was searching in Siddhānta-kaumudī (SK) how this tandrā made and got the following information.



SK 3138 (A 3.2.158): spṛhi-gṛhi-pati-dayi-nidrā-tandrā-śraddhābhya āluc. SK gives an answer that, originally it was tad + drā and ‘d’ irregularly changed to ‘n’. But how can we, in first place, add ‘tad’ with ‘drā’ dhātu? Does ‘tad’ work as an upasarga for drā dhātu?



Somewhere I heard that, ‘tandra’ is a sautra dhātu. Then, how can use sautra dhātu in common usage?



Regards,

Prasad J
