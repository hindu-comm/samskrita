Please avoid inferring your own etymology according to your knowledge. If you want please refer to classical lexicons which would help you to understand the context.  तद् द्रातीति तन्द्रा, तन्द्रा प्रमीला, निद्रा - Here it is used as noun derived from तद् + द्रा + क = तन्द्रा।

Hope you are conversant with the process of derivation according grammar as you have raised the question.

We are using only the word तन्द्रा as it is available with descriptions provided by Panini and it dowsn't mean we are inventing our own derivation or the use of the verb. Here it is derived from द्रा कुत्सायाम् धातुः, and as it is available in the word we explain it with possible ways. Who said tad is "upasarga"?

As you are aware, you are reading a Purana text and not a text in classical literature.

What made you to think tandrā is used as an verb in this context? Please refer to a dictionary first before posting your questions so as to save your time and others also spent on unwanted queries.

  

Mm. Vimalaji has given the dictionary meaning for the word which makes clear it is not a verb used here.

Even if you think it is used, it is a Purana text.

And you are not expected to use the Sautra dhatu, which is inferred from the sUtra, to be the verb deriving the word.

  

It is explained as derived from तन्द्र अवसादे verb, + भावे घञ्. + टाप्. तन्द्रा निद्रा इत्यर्थः।

The same Sautra dhatu used to derive the word तन्द्रा. That is the purpose of explaining it as सौत्रधातु and you are not expected to use it
as a regular verb as it is not listed among other धातु-s as the regular verb.

  

Hope this will satisfy your inquisition.
