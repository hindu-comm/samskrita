If out of track, I can add a beautiful wave from the waves of beauty (ocean) -

  

वितन्द्री माहेन्द्री विततिरपि संमीलति दृशाम्,

महासंहारेऽस्मिन् विहरति सति, त्वत्पतिरसौ॥२६॥  

  

The row of (one thousand) eyes without any closure of eye-lashes (without sleep) of Mahendra also closes at the time of the great destruction, O chaste wife, your husband alone roams (at this time) ... (while all other gods meet their end of life time).
