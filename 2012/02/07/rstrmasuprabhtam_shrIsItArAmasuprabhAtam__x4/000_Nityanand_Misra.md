Śrīsītārāmasuprabhātam (श्रीसीतारामसुप्रभातम्) (2009), literally "The beautiful dawn of Lord Sitaram", is a Sanskrit minor poem (Khandkavya) of the Suprabhātakāvya (dawn-poem) genre composed by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya in the year 2008. The poem consists of 40 verses in Śārdūlavikrīḍita, Vasantatilakā, Sragdharā and Mālinī metres. The Phalaśruti at the end is in the Vasantatilakā metre. The work was composed by the poet in the Āshvin Navarātra (September 30 to October 8) of 2008 when he was in Tirupati for a Kathā programme. Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University published the work with a Hindi commentary by the poet on March 14, 2009. A musical rendition of the work, set to music and sung by the Jagadguru himself in the Bairagi Raga of Hindustani classical music, was released as an audio CD by Yuki Cassettes in 2009.  
  
The musical rendition by the poet is now available on YouTube under [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDAWvwNNwws)  
  
A scanned PDF of the work is available online [from here](http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/ViewContent/pdfs/Jagadguru%20Rambhadracharya%20-%20Srisitaramasuprabhatam.pdf)
