I would strongly recommend an old book by M. R. Kale which is  
available free as a pdf file on line. It serves both as a text book  
and reference book.  
  
This is in response to a request for a Reference Sanskrit grammar  
book.  
  
A regular grammar book which is precise and used as text is one by W.  
D. Whitney - it can be purchased or picked up free on line as well.  
Both of these serve as excellent reference books. I recommend that  
Whitney's book be supplemented by his book on roots and verb forms.  
  
For Vedic grammar, you need something else - McDonnell e.g.  
  
It is cheap to buy and also freely available on line as a pdf file.  
  
If a text book is desired with small doses of grammar in each chapter,  
then there are several choices of both old and new books.  
  
I would specifically vote against the Egenes book; it is wrong in many  
places! I had specifically looked at it as a possible textbook, but  
decided against it.  
  
There are several standard textbooks available.  
There are books by Goldman, Deshpande, Aklujkar. I like all three.  
  
There are many others as well.  
  
Of course, there are details reference books like siddhAnta-kaumudI,  
but these are more useful for advanced queries and not so useful as  
text books.  
  
Hope this helps.
