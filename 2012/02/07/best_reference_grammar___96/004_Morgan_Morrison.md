Namaste, Lorenzo,

  

Are you looking for a Sanskrit grammar with which you can learn the Sanskrit language (i.e. a tutorial Sanskrit grammar presentation) or are you looking for a Sanskrit reference grammar, to which you may refer for reviewing some of the more complex and not often used aspects of Sanskrit grammar? Do you know Sanskrit well enough to study Panini's Sanskrit grammar? Are you looking for a Sanskrit grammar in English or some other language? If you can provide me with this information, as appropriate, I can make some specific suggestions for an appropriate Sanskrit grammar for your needs. The Sanskrit Studies Foundation's Library has an extensive collection of Sanskrit reference materials, including over 200 Sanskrit grammars, as well as links to numerous Internet resources that are mostly in the public domain. Contact me if I can be of any additional assistance to you in finding a suitable Sanskrit grammar.

  

Best,
