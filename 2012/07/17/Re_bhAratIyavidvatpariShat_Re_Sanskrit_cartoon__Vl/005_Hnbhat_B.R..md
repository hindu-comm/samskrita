It can be split जागृत + आः \> जागृताः, though the euphony is likely to obscure the form. Now you can find the form in the imperative mood, 2nd person plural in the normal conjugation from जागृ to wake up.

  

It could have been better, split जागृत आः, मम प्रजाः better to facilitate understanding the expression. आः is interjection here used to express his joy on seeing the water and wanted to share it with his subjects.
