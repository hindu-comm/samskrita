I think there is something wrong in the sentence.

  

*जागर्ति* *जागृतः*जाग्रति, जागर्षि जागृथः जागृथ, जागर्मि जागृवः जागृमः।  
  
As for the form, it is present tense I person duel.

  

If he wanted imperative 2nd person plural, it would have been जाग्रत
get up my subjects. If he wanted to use past participle of the verb it would be जागरिताः प्रजाः, and not जागृताः.

  

Somebody would listen to the audio carefully and decide whether it is written wrongly if the pronunciation is correct form. It is the last part of the video.

  

Hence I am forwarding this to the group.
