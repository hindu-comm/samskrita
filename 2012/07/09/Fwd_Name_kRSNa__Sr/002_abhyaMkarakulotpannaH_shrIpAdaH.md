नमस्ते श्रीमन् "अलेक्झाण्डर झाशेन्युक"-महोदय !  
I hope my scripting of your name in देवनागरी makes the right pronunciation.  
By forwarding your message, to the two groups  
[bvpar...@googlegroups.com](), and  
[sams...@googlegroups.com]()  
Mr. Bhat has facilitated me to join you in your study of this श्लोक ७१.४ from उद्योग-पर्व in महाभारत -  
कृषिर्भूवाचकः शब्दो नश्च निर्वृत्तिवाचकः।

  
तयोरैक्यं परं ब्रह्म कृष्ण इत्यभिधीयते।।  

Coming to the interpretations, firstly I would always take it that interpretations are not translations. The interpreters often indulge in deriving extended meaning.  
कृषिर्भूवाचकः शब्दो = the attractive feature of the Lord's existence.  

-   Since I am an engineer by profession, and comparing the activity of
    industrial production with agriculture, it often comes to mind,
    industrial production only changes the form of materials. In
    agriculture, one seed grows into a plant and has thousands of grains
    ! For all his progress in science and technology, I don't think Man
    has come anywhere near to such 'productivity' ! The agricultural
    phenomenon thus becomes "the attractive feature of the Lord's
    existence". -   Yes, the word कृषि is derived from the root verb कृष्. In पाणिनि's
    धातुपाठ it is detailed as कृष विलेखने (कृष् = special writing). I
    would derive extended meaning of विलेखनम् as 'special
    presentation'. As mentioned above, कृषि the noun, is a 'special
    presentation'. -   And how expansive is the presentation ? All across the earth !
    भूवाचक ! (वाचक = one can speak about it, one can read it) all across
    the भू (= the earth, the soil) -   I also read an implied meaning of कृषिर्भूवाचकः शब्दो as 'speaking
    of worldly involvement, entanglement'  

नश्च निर्वृत्तिवाचकः = न connotes निर्वृत्ति being aloof of it.  

Interestingly the word here is निर्वृत्ति, not निवृत्ति  

-   Common meaning of निवृत्ति is retirement, going away from it -   To my mind निर्वृत्ति is not निवृत्ति. निर्वृत्ति is being aloof of
    it, even when being there. So निर्वृत्ति is a matter of mental
    make-up.

तयोरैक्यं = Togetherness of कृषि and निर्वृत्ति = Togetherness of worldly existence and of being aloof of it  
You have also asked when कृष् + न are so obvious components of कृष्ण, why is the word कृषि referred to in this श्लोक ?  

-   To my mind just as निर्वृत्ति is भाववृत्ति (what is implicit and
    explicit) of न, कृषि is भाववृत्ति (implicit and explicit) of कृष्.  
-   To such extent, the word वाचक (what is to be understood of its
    reading) connotes to read both, what is implicit and explicit

Would my analysis above fit well also with what you have quoted from lecture of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada ?  

krsi = "repetition of birth;"  

-   thousands of grains on a plant growing from one seed. In fact I am
    tempted to quote two lines from a verse in Marathi by संत तुकाराम
    17th century saint-poet of Maharashtra, contemporary of great
    warrior king Shivaji. The lines are - "एका बीजापोटी । फळे रसाळ गोमटी
    ।।" (From the womb of a seed, charming juicy fruits !) In another
    verse, he also said तिळाएवढे बांधुनि घर। आंत राहे विश्वंभर।।
    तिळाइतुके हें बिंदुले। तेणे त्रिभुवन कोंदाटले।। हरिहरांच्या या
    मूर्ती। बिंदुल्यात येती जाती ।। (He who pervades the universe stays
    in a house so small as a seed of sesame. This point-entity so small
    as sesame pervades the universe. The idols, forms of Hari and Hara
    come and go in and out of this point-entity.) संत तुकाराम was not a
    learned Brahmin. He was a mere shop-keeper. But he had such exalted
    spiritual experiences, that he could narrate those experiences in
    such short, sweet, magnificent verses ! I take it that expressions
    such as these verses are not just flights of poetic fancy. They are
    most exalted spiritual experiences. The statements have a signature
    of authority in them. Is he referring to reincarnations (re-births)
    when saying बिंदुल्यात येती जाती come and go in and out of this
    point-entity ?

-   na means "one who checks it."

The word निर्वृत्ति also has in it two components निर् + वृत्ति.  

-   The prefix निर् also has the meaning निराकरण elimination, I think
    'elimination' is more definite than even 'checking' -   The word वृत्ति also has the meaning 'repetitive occurrence'. -   Together निर्वृत्ति would mean 'elimination of repetitive
    occurrence'.

Just to conclude, परं ब्रह्म कृष्ण इत्यभिधीयते brings to mind what अर्जुन also said in  
परं ब्रह्म परं धाम पवित्रं परमं भवान् । (गीता १०-१२)  
Thanks for giving the opportunity to indulge in this deliberation.  
सस्नेहम्
