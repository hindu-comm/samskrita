The Mahabharata (Udyoga-parva) 71.4 states:  

krsir bhu-vacakah sadbo, nas ca nirvrti-vacakah  
tayor aikyam param brahma, krsna ity abhidhiyate  

"The word 'krs' is the attractive feature of the Lord's existence, and 'na' means  
spiritual pleasure. When the verb 'krs' is added to the affix 'na', it becomes 'Krishna',  
which indicates the Supreme Absolute Truth."

1.i dont understand theexplanation here : as i take it "*krsir bhu-vacakah sadbo" literally means the word kRSisignify the sense of bhU (earth). is it corect? How than out of this statement "the word kRSi signify the sense of bhU (earth)" the statement "*The word 'krs' is the attractive feature of the Lord's existence" follows?

*2. why does this shloka* (Udyoga-parva) 71.4 explain the meaning of the noun kRSi and not the meaning of the verb kRS which is in the name kRSNa

3.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in his lecture

<http://www.prabhupadavani.org/main/Bhagavad-gita/GT249.html>

says "Krsi. Krsi means cultivation, and krsi means very great. Krs-dhatu. So krsna or krs means who repeated repetition of birth, repetition. So krsi -- "repetition of birth;" na means "one who checks it." He is Krsna. "Repetition of birth, one who checks," He is Krsna. Therefore our repetition of birth can be checked only by God. Otherwise not possible. Harim vina na mrtim taranti: "Nobody can stop his repetition of birth and death without having the causeless mercy of God.""

The Monier-Williams dictionary doesnt say kRSi means very great , does kRSi really mean that?

3.1 The MW also doesnt say kRSi is repetition of birth , does kRSi really mean that?
