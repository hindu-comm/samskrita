I would like to have a text or pdf document of all the ashtadhyayi  
sutras in sequential order. I tried searching online, but usually the  
sutras are with explanations.  
I just wanted the sutras as a reference in an ordered list.  
No english transliteration, just the Devanagari script please.  
Something like this,  
1.1.1 \<sutra text>  
1.1.2 \<sutra text>  
...  
1.2.1\<sutra text>  
...  
2.1.1\<sutra text>  
...  
until the end of the 8th.  
  
By the way, sanskrit text does not display many conjuncts in the kindle.  
It is always with the halanths for the half consonant. Can this be  
fixed? Or the only option is to create a pdf?  
I hope someone can help.  
Thanks!  
Vishal
