Thank you so much, Sunder!  
Is it also possible to get the word document or text document from which  
this pdf was made?  
Because, when searching for the sutra number in the pdf on the computer,  
it is easier to enter roman numbers to search (eg 3.2.1 instead of  
entering devanagari)  
I can use devanagari, but this will be a bit faster.  
So if I can get the text, then I can change all the sutra numbers & ask  
on here, if someone can convert that into a pdf again.  
Thanks,  
Vishal
