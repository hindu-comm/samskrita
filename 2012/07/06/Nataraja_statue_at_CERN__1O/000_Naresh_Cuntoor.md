\[Mod. note\]  
  
There were several responses to the article posted by Sri Ramakrishnan referring to the statue of Nataraja at CERN. Some of the messages thanked the poster, others were heading in various religious and metaphysical tangents. We have disallowed most of the posts because their relevance to the list was minimal at best.
