Dear Group,

  

I do not recollect where I got the enclosed picture of of Bapu (नृसिंह) Dev Shastri. He was a well-known scholar and teacher of the Indian system of ग्रहगणित and taught it and other related subjects from the year 1841 to 1889 at the Sanskrit College at VaraNasI. The well-known book in Marathi published in 1896, called 'भारतीय ज्योति:शास्त्र' by S.B.Ketkar has a brief biographical note on him. According to it, he was born in 1821 in the town of Toke (टोके) on the GodavarI river in Dist Ahmednagar. Recognizing his expertise in ग्रहगणित and Hindu Mathematics, Mr. Wilkinson, the Political Agent at Sehore, Bhopal, had him appointed as a teacher in the Sanskrit College, where he worked all his life. Later he became an Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and the Asiatic Society of Bengal and Fellow of the Calcutta and Allahabad Universities.

  

Some more information about him is available at p.453 in the book ’The Modern History of the Indian Chiefs, Rajas, Zamindars’, available in [books.google.com](http://books.google.com) at <http://tinyurl.com/d9q966s>
