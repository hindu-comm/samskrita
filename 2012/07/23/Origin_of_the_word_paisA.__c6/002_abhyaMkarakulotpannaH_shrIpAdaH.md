नमाः सर्वेभ्यः !  
१) The small coin of old Indian system in British Raj times was पै -  
३ पै = १ पैसा; ४ पैसे = १ आणा (अतः १२ पै = १ आणा)  
१ रुपया = १६ आणे (= ६४ पैसे = १९२ पै )  
२) Actually pronunciation of पै is similar to the ratio 'pie' in geometry. पै also is a ratio, a part of; here the smallest part of the nominal coin, the रुपया  
३) Speaking of market-management terminology, there is a style of saying, "MNCs are looking for a 'slice of the pie' of the Indian market." In "..'pie'-charts..", one shows the slices of the pie. Hence this term. Actually total angle around a point is two-pie radians. So "..'pie' radians" is itself a slice of the angle around a point, rather half of the angle.  
४) In Sankrit shop = आपणम्. I wonder whether the word आपणम् has some relation with पण्य which means trade. आपणम् is the place where पण्य i.e. trade is transacted. There are the प and ण -वर्ण sounds in पै, पैसा, पण्य, आपणम्. Do these sounds have a close connection with exchange of commodities and the coins, the means of exchange ?
