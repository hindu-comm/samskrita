Respects to all.



The subdenominations of the Rupee before 1957 were Anna \[16 to the Rupee\], pice \[four to an Anna\] and Paisa \[12 to an Anna\]. In 1957 the new decimal coinage was introduced - a rupee equalled 100 Naye Paise - each division being one naya paisa. In 1964, the mint considered the unit is no longer 'naya' it is thereafter known as 'Paisa' only.



Before independence, there have been other sub-units of the Rupee in different regions. e.g. Panam was a unit in Kerala. 'duTTu' was common in southern parts of Tamil Nadu whic equalled one third of an Anna. Similarly the same value or 1/48 of a Rupee was known as 'dub' in parts of North.'



The Units or subunits need not be of Sanskrit origin.



With reverence
