This is the coinage system before India introduced in 1956 decimal system of coinage.

  

**The Frozen Series 1947-1950**

This represented the currency arrangements during the transition period upto the establishment of the Indian Republic. The Monetary System remained unchanged at

One Rupee consisting of 192 pies.

1 Rupee = 16 Annas

1 Anna = 4 Pice पाँव् अण-s

1 Pice = 3 Pies - पाई-s?



1 Ana - 12 piece 

1 Rupee = 192 pieces

Anyhow good guess work. पाँव is derived from पाद, quarter. and the पादिका, etc. good guess work, but not practically applicable, except for Quarter Ana, = 3 piece.

These denominations have taken in different languages different forms, some times पाँव आणे in Kannada.पाँवली in Tulu and Telugu. and so on. but it is not called पैसा but the last denomination is called always पैसा as I remember. The word पाई may be a corrupt form from पाद or पादिका, but English has already "piece" in its vocabulary. Remaining is left to guess work like naming the child and trying to know Sanskrit meaning for the name.
