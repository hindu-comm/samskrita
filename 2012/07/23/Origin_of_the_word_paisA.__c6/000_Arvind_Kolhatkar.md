Dear Group,

  

I request for help from the learned members here to determine the origin of the common word in many Indian languages’पैसा’.

  

In MarathI, (and also in Hindi) another word 'पैका' has a similar meaning. 

  

According to 'The Dictionary of Old Marathi', by Tulpule-Feldhaus,पैका arises from Sanskrit 'पादिक'. The Marathi Dictionary of Date-karve derives it as Sanskrit 'पदाति’ Prakrit ’पाइक्क’ MarathI 'पाईक', a common word meaning 'a servant. Though neither of the two dictionaries says soexplicitly, their suggestion appears to be that wages paid to aपाईक isपाइका or पैका.

  

I consulted a few Hindi dictionaries but could not find in them any indication as to the origin of these words.

  

Monier-Williams has a brief entry on'पादिक'.at p.618, the relevant part of which reads: ...; with or sc. *ahar,* daily wages. Pat. (sc. is short for 'namely, to wit, as follows'. Pat. is Patanjali.)

  

Am I correct in inferring that’पैसा’ and 'पैका' can be traced back to'पादिक'? Does anyone know the exact citation in Patanjali where’अहर्’ is used in combination with 'पादिक'?
