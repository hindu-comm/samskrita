The article talks about motif of Sita's Birth . Thanks for bringing notice to this article. I think Dr. Raghavan has done some good research on this topics as depicted in various Ramayana in South Asian Variations . One can refer to Asian variations in Ramayana edited by Srinivasa iyengar. It is available on DLI website. But all this doesn't prove Sita being older to Rama.  
One can also refer to Dr Bhat's post in the same thread.
