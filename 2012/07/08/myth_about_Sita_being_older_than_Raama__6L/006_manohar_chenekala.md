This is my first post in this group, If any mistakes are there please forgive me.  
  
there is one more claim that, growth of sita is not like others and normal. she came to the marraige age with in few days after getting into janak maharaj hands.  
I don't know the facts about this. If anybody know any information please share.  
  
There is one more sloka in sundarakanda , in which maa sita says that she was happy with her husband for almost 12 years in **ayodhya**. so, with reference to that,  
her age, by the time of abduction by ravan should be morethan 25. as this abduction happened in the 14th year of **vanavas**...  
I will give reference to this sloka as early as possible  
  
  
regards,
