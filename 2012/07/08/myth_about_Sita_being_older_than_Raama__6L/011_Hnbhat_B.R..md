All the claim that Sita was elder than Rama is related with the fact that she was found and brought up by Janaka and was not born to him as Ramayana and many other sources confirm. The remaining factors are dependent on how She was born and got into the box he found when he was ploughing the land for sacrifice on the river bank which is differently described in different versions of Ramayana, but Ramayana of Valmiki itself is silent on this point. Here is an article discussing the various explanations on the birth and parentage of Sita herself,

One of the sources say she was born as the daughter of Mandodari and was abandoned by them as she would destruct him due to inauspicious moment. This seems to be influenced by the story of Krishna's birth as the destroyer of Kamsa was foretold to him at the time of the marriage of Devaki and Vasudeva and he killed the children born. The rest is left to the imagination how the chronology corresponds to Rama's birth and parentage as speculated in the other discussions in different groups.
