Namaste

Its a well known myth that seeta was older than Raama. Atleast thats what I heard in my childhood however this verse in Valmiki Ramayanam gives facts. This is in a chapter in AranyaKanda, and argument between seeta and ravana before sita's abduction.

  

  

मम भर्ता महातेजा वयसा पञ्चविंशकः \|\|

अष्टा दश हि वर्षाणि मम जन्मनि गण्यते \| ३।४७।१०

  

महातेजा= great resplendent my, husband;

वयसा पंच विंशकः= by age, five, twenty - twenty-five years;

मम जन्मनि= my, from birth;

अष्टा दश वर्षाणिहि= eight, ten - eighteen, years, only;

गण्यते= reckoned up.

My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth. \[3-47-10\]

  

I would like now ask scholars here, is there any other proof in any other renowned literature which talks about their age. I want to know how did this myth originated that Seeta was older than Raama.
