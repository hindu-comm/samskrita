A small correction to my previous post.  
  

Dear Sita Rama,  
There are several false and unsubstantiated claims on yahoo answers. Please be sure before you believe them. A wife normally in Indian Tradition is younger than husband. Sita is definitely younger than Rama  
  
Most of The answers provided on this link  
  
<http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061014034941AAZ8H9p>  
  

answers that are not backed by any stanzas from Ramayana. Please don't try to mislead yourself or the group
