The age of Marriage for men and women has varied considerably from age to age, province to province and caste to caste even at the same time. A man was to marry after completing his Vedic studies: but the peroid varies ( 12, 24, 36, 48). Usually 12 years were devoted to Brahmacharya in ancient times and as Upananyayna took place at the age of 8 a man would ordinarily be at the age of 20 at the time of marriage.  
  
Manu Remarks (IX, 94) remarks that a man of thirty may marry a girl of 12 years old or a man of 24 years who is in hurry to marry may marry a girl fwho is 8 years old. Based on this Vishnu purana ( III, 10.16) says that the ages of the bride and bridegroom should be in the ratio 1:3. Angirasa says that the bride should be 2, 3, 5 5 or more years younger. In Mahabaratha Gautama is prepared to give his daghter to Uttanka if he could be a youth of 16 years. One can also read anusasana 44.14 and other relavent verses for varying details  
  
Some verses in the Rig Veda ( X, 85-87, 26-27, 460) indicate that married wives could not have been child wives, but must have been grown ups. Some verses may give different opinions. On the whole one may conclude that during Rg vedic times girls were probably married at any age ( either before or after puberty) and sometimes remained spinsters.  
  
From various Grahya and Dharma sutras it is clear that girls were married before or just after puberty.  
  
I can elaborate on this topic further but i don't think it is required.  
  
From this it is very clear that the age of a wife is always less than that of husband. It becomes untenable to interpret any of the verses of Ramayana or any other Indian Epic that the age of Sita is Older to Rama. Please note Ramas marriage was sanctified by great Sages such as Vasista and Visvamitra the Custodians and of Dharma and Shastras.
