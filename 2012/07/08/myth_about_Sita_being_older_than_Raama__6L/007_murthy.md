In Sarga 66, Balakanda, Valmiki Ramayan, Gorakhpur edition there is reference to a number of kings going to war against Janaka for refusing to give Sita in marriage. Janaka was defeated and had to do tapasya to win the favours of gods who gave him an army.

भूतलादुत्थितां तां तु वर्धमानां ममात्मजाम् । वरयामासुरागत्य राजानो मुनिपुङ्गव ॥

Sita would have been of marriageable age many years before Sita got married. But Rama was ऊनषोडशवर्ष- less than sixteen at the time of his marriage.

This could make one believe that Sita was older than Rama. Of course one could also believe that kings were eager to marry her when she was not yet of marriageable age. The word वर्धमानाम् does not support it.
