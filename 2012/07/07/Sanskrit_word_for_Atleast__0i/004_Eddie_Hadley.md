Rajagopalan,



From the English viewpoint,

“at least”,

designates an amount, quantity, degree, etc. (“at least” - is written as two words).



However, from the way the sentence " I am atleast struggling to complete this" is written, it is not clear just

what it is that is that you wish to designate.

Is It the “struggling”, in which case you would say

" At the very least, it is a struggle, for me to complete this” - *carrying the implication that it may even turn out to be too difficult to complete at all*.

Or *it could be that you wish to align yourself with a group of one or more people, that are actually trying to complete something, - as opposed to those that aren’t even trying?*

In which case, you would say something like, “I, at least, am trying to complete this!” - complete with exclamation mark.

I’ll leave the Sanskrit side to others.

Eddie
