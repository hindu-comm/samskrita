I don't find any objection in taking the word दूर्वा in the verse above to offer दूर्वा grass and can't imagine how you find any in the verse. It is a matter of practice in worship which cannot be obtained by learning Grammar and Sanskrit Language only, which "mantra" should be used in a specific ritual act.

  

Any how as the name suggests it is the praise of दूर्वा grass and the description fits properly to the दूर्वा grass. The first 3 verses are found in महानारायणोपनिषत् -

  

*सहस्रपरमा देवी*शतमूला शताङ्कुरा।

सर्वँहरतु मे पापं दूर्वा दुःस्वप्ननाशिनी॥ ३४॥ काण्डात् काण्डात् प्ररोहन्ती परुषः परुषः परि। एवा नो दूर्वे प्रतनु सहस्रेण शतेन च॥ ३५॥

या शतेन प्रतनोषि सहस्रेण विरोहसि।

तस्यास्ते देवीष्टकेविधेम हविषा वयम् ॥ ३६॥

  

Anyhow I do not know about the particular use of the दूर्वा grass. You will better to refer to any commentary available on the portion to the use of specific "mantra" as I am not good at Vedic Sanskrit. Or some other member adept at the Vedic rituals would explain the meaning in the highlighted portion, except which the remaining stanza-s are simple Sanskrit verses.
