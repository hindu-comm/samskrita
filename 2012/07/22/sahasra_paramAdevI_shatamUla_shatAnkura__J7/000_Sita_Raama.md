sahasra parama devi shatamoola shataankura

sarvam haratu me papam doorva duswapna nashani.

  

सहस्र परमादेवी शतमूलशताङ्कुर।

सर्वं हरतुमे पापं दूर्वा दु:स्वपन नाशनि ।।

  

I came heard this shloka, in a pooja in youtube, I could not understand the meaning of दूर्वा here. In the video on youtube, after this shloka he told to put "durva grass" at deity's feet.

How does durva grass fit in this shloka

Can the learned scholars comment here, and if there is any typo in the shloka I pointed out please correct me.

Please also provide the complete meaning of the above verse as well.
