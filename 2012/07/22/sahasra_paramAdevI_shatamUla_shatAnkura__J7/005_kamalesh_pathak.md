sri sita raama ji,

i had little defferent shloka - as under. (pardon fonts)

durve hyamrita sampanna shata moolaa shataankuraa \|

shatam paatak samhantree shatamaayushya vardhinee \|\|

this shloka is chanted while offering pooja to ganesh diety.

some 3 decades ago an old vaidya said that durvaa is the grass that has ability to seperate the 7 layers of skin but i don't have more refrence in this regards,

warm regards to the group,

kamalesh pathak
