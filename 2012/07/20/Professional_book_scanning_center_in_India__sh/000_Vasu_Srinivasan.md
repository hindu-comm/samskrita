namaste

  

Im looking for a professional book scanning center (in India). I found several old books / magazines (mostly tamil, some samskritam) in our attic (1930s - 1960s published) and would like to scan them. Would like to know if there is a good scanning center that comes with recommendation and have experience in doing this, preferably in Coimbatore / Chennai / Bangalore areas.
