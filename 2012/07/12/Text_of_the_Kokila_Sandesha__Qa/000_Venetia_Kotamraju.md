Namaskarah sarvebhyah,

As part of the print and eBook edition of the Kokila Sandesha which we have just brought out, we have created a PDF of the entire text of the Kokila Sandesha which you can download from this page:
<http://www.rasalabooks.com/books/poetry-kavya/kokila-sandesa/>.

This text has been modified slightly from previous editions based. You can download the translators' notes from the same webpage if you would like to read about what has been changed and why, as well as refer to the bibliography.

The PDF is not copy- and paste-able due to technical issues. If anyone would like to have a copy of the poem in Unicode format in Word I can easily send it. Please write to me off-list.

Best,

Venetia
