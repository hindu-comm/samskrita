Thank you Nityanand Mahodaya. We may do a print on demand version on Amazon in the future, but for now no as it requires some re-working of the pdf and a mildly complex tax procedure. We are though working on an eBook which will I hope be available on the Kindle although I need to look further into that as not yet sure if Kindle's new format supports Sanskrit and Devanagari. 

I will certainly keep you posted though.
