Dear Group,

  

Ancient Greek and Latin are considered as 'classical languages' in Europe. This fact is reflected in common English phrases such as 'Classical Tripos' of Cambridge, 'reading Classics at Oxford' etc. This nomenclature is based on scholarly consensus and common agreement and not on any decision or ruling by a Government or an authority. This much is beyond any dispute.



By the same token Sanskrit has been accepted since long, as a result of scholarly consensus, as a 'classical language'. This has never been challenged by anyone, nor did anyone demand that this fact be 'formalized' by a Government decree.



Yet the Government of India has taken upon themselves the authority and the task of 'declaring' Sanskrit as a classical language. In this connection see the news in 'The Hindu' of May 28, 2005 (<http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/28/stories/2005102809281200.htm>).
Several other links also state this fact. Despite attempts, I have not been able to trace an order or a Government authorized press release about it.)



I have been trying to find out as to what authority or law empowers, enables or requires the Government to take up this matter for a decision. I have not been able to find such an authority or law, beyond a statement in some places that the decision follows a 'constitutional decree', the date or the wording of which is unavailable. Nowhere in the rest of the world, and for no other language, has a similar thing been done. The Constitution of India certainly does not have anything that would appear to cast this power or duty upon the Government. The only special distinction conferred upon Sanskrit by the Constitution is in Article 351 which says:



"351. Directive for development of the Hindi language It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.‚Äù



'Conferring' the status of classical language upon Sanskrit in the modern times is, to my mind, a shallow and presumptuous exercise, comparable to 'honoring' Adi Shankaracharya or Shivaji with the award of Bharat Ratna.



What has prompted the Government to take up this empty task, keeping aside a myriad of more urgent problems that cry for its attention?
