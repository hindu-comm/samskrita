\[Moderators' note\]:  
  
The connection of this conversation to the state of Sanskrit educators in India does not require a stretch of imagination. Hopefully this will provide some food for thought. But please do not reply to this thread with messages that are best suited to a Hinduism forum.  
  
Some of the lists members are not in the moderated list - we trust they will continue to self-evaluate the appropriateness of a post. For those who are on the moderated list, please note that we may reject replies to this thread without explanation.
