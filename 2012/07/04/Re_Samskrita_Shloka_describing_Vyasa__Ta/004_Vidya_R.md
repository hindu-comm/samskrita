For those interested:  

Inअप्पय्य-दीक्षित's कुवलयानन्दः this is an example quoted for न्यूनताद्रूप्य-रूपकालङ्कारः \| 

  

The two objects are represented as (almost) identical, one slightly short of all characteristics of the other.

  

vyAsa is brahma, except he is not 4-headed.

vyAsa is hari, but he only has 2 hands.

vyAsa is shambhu, without the forehead-eye.
