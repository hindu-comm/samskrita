Type Sanskrit when you are searching on Wikipedia aboutscholars like poet Kalidas, Bhavbhuti and Maharishi Panini and if these or other such lines greet you on the virtual world you can thank around 150 Sanskrit teachers from Gujarat, who have done their bit to add flavour to God’s own language online too.

Wikipedia is translating information related to Sanskrit language, subject and scholars and around 150 teachers of Sanskrit have come forward to contribute informative paragraphs to this initiative which will be uploaded on the wikipedia page. The initiative is taken by Gujarat University (GU)’s department of Sanskrit together with an organization named Sanskrit Bharti. On Thursday, around 150 Sanskrit teachers from different colleges in Gujarat gathered at the GU’s Bhasha Bhavan to understand the nitty gritty of the plan. The meeting was part of two-day long workshop, entitled Sanskrit Wikipedia — Introduction and Expectations, at the Bhasha Bhavan.

Head of the department, Vasant Bhatt stated that the initiative aims to provide information to youngsters, students about our ancient language in an age of computer and internet. “Wikipedia has information available about Sanskrit language, scholars and subjects in English language. Some of the information is also misleading. So, we aim to rectify them, translate information from English to Sanskrit and upload it on wikipedia,” said Bhatt while speaking to media.

Bhatt believes students of Sanskrit will get biggest help from this initiative apart from people interested in knowing the ancient language. Details will be finalised in the two-day workshop for taking the initiative to its next stage.

Indeed an innovative idea by Sanskrit scholars from Gujarat. Best wish to all of them.
