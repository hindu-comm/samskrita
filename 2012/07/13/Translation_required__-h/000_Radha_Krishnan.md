Dear Sanskrit friends,  
  
suprabhatam.  
  
We are opening a small cultural hall in one particular place. For  
that purpose, I want the following to be translated into Sanskrit.  
Any help would be appreciated.  
  
  
"Today being the auspicious day, this cultural hall is opened and  
dedicated to the Lord."  
  
With all regards,  
RK.
