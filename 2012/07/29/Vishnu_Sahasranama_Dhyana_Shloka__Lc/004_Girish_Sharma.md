Thank you to all the responders. arin = discus certainly clears up the question.  
  
I also have a confusion about another aspect of the shloka. With the preceding pada it is:  
  
Zubhrair-abhrair-adabhrair-upari viracitair-muktapIyUSavarSaiH  
  
AnandI naH punIyAd-ari-nalina-gadA-ZaGkha-pANir-mukundaH  
  
Common translations of the shloka connect AnandI with the preceding pada, something like:  
  
Mukunka enjoys the abundant shower of nectar released from a bright cloud above.  
  
Due to all the instrumental cases in the preceding pada, is it not possibly:  
  
May Mukunda purify us by an abundant shower of nectar...?
