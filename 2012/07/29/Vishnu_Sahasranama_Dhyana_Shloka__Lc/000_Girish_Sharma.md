In the last pada of a shloka, I don't understand punIyAdari in  
  
AnandI naH punIyAdari-nalina-gadA-ZaGkha-pANir-mukundaH.  
  
The rest I believe is "the blissful Mukunda Who holds a conch shell, a  
mace, and a lotus."  
  
Could it be punIyAt ari? Perhaps some conjugation of pU that I don't  
understand, followed by ari (enemy)? If so, how can ari fit with the  
following samAsa?  
  
Thank you.
