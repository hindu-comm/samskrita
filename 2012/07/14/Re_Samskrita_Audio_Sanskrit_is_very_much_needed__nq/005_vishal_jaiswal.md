I second the request - even living in India is not of much help, when it  
comes to audio - because unless one is interested in listening to  
current affairs on the AIR internet stream, there is barely anything  
that exists outside this area.  
  
And speaking of stories - does anyone even write them barring what  
already exists from the past? We dont have any sanskrit magazine other  
than sambhashna sandesh - which itself carries just a small percentage  
of simple stories.  
  
If Sanskrit needs to move beyond the research interests of a small group  
of scholars to become a living language again, we need tremendous  
amounts of input in both written and spoken forms which is \*not\*  
esoteric, highly philosophical and complex.  
  
If a list of such resources has been posted on the group, a link would  
be appreciated.
