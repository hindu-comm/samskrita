Dear Sanskrit Scholars, You may disagree with me but i consider that in comparison to other languages there are little sanskrit audio materials on the net. There are some but it is certainly not enough to master sanskrit. Sanskrit radio is good but not enough. I think if one wants to have a language mastered , he should listen to it 24/7 for months continiously. I guess this opportunity is available to those who live in India and study the language there. But what should other people like me do, who cant visit India ? To increase audio sanskrit availability , what would you say if ,for example, everyone of us uploaded here maybe a short story recorded by himself , or whatever recorded in sanskrit (of course its up to you but it 'd better be not songs. They're of little help (at least to me)) . It maybe 30 seconds long or 1 hour . It doesnt matter. The point being it should be audio sanskrit. A lot of you unlike me speak sanskrit perfectly , so to help others do the same , please record something and post it. I promise i will listen to it all and not even one time. I hope this request doesnt sound like a demand , but i really need it. Maybe you have other ideas where we can post it and organize the whole thing.  
P.S. i have recorded a little sanskrit audio its attached to this email, if you 're in any way interested, please help me correct mistakes . And record a respose..If would help promote this cause to increase audio sanskrit on the net in such a way, that would benefit a great deal. Thanks in advance .
