Dear Sanskrit lover,  
We will soon post some conversations/discussions between two or three people. The discussion may be just between a teacher and student, father and son, business man and customer, two friends or simple discussions. Will it be useful to you? If yes then we will send to you. Please reply us. We will try our best to maintain good quality of the audio recordings. Please do not expect extremely high quality audio but good quality audio which will be clearly understandable to everybody.  
  
Regards,  
Subhendu Rath,
