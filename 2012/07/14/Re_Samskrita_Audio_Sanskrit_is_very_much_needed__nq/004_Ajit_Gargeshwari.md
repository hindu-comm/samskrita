I agree in order to a learn a language one has to read write and speak in that language. It may be a good idea to record classroom lessons or forums in which people speak and Sanskrit and upload it them on a web. One finds lot of slokas recitals and songs on the web in Sanskrit but very little or no audio of Sanskrit used as a spoken language. Are there any such sites or audio on the web it would be very interesting.
