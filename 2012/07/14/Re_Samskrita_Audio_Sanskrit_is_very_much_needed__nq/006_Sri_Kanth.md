Dear Sir, I think you are not aware of Chandamama Sanskrit....

<http://chandamama.com/lang/SAN/index.htm>

  

They have sanskrit magazines archived from the eighties...

<http://www.chandamama.com/archive/SAN/storyArchive.htm>

  

I downloaded all of them. Really its a treasure trove... in simple sanskrit and interesting stories as well.

  

One can subscribe (about Rs.400) or read online...

  

SriKanth!
