But what about he who himself commented on all the प्रस्थानत्रयी and independently written many works supplementary to his advaita theory, when preaching others say:

  

*शब्दजालं महारण्यं*चित्तभ्रमणकारणम् ।

अतः प्रयत्नाज्ज्ञातव्यं तत्त्वज्ञात्तत्त्वमात्मनः ॥ - विवेकचूडामणि.

  

It could be meant that he wants nothing to be learnt from reading the texts written by him in volumes and volumes. How can this be justified?

  

This शब्दजाल would certainly include his own writings, if one contents. This is just for the same argument if Shankara quoted Panini rules, he would not have negated it for others. By the same token, how he can say in his विवेकचूडामणि, शब्दजाल is only confusing your mind and seek the truth about by all means about the Self. It simply states nothing can be achieved to realize the self, only by reading books. In the same way, when the above context is translated similarly, he doesn't say व्याकरण is useless at all, but it is not in anyway helpful in realization of the Self or to evade the cycle of birth and death. Only clinging to the literal meanings, here it is too far fetched. For any one with the धातुपाठ the phrase itself suggests the Grammar. And there is nothing to interpret as you have suggested, syntactically coherent with your thinking.

  

As I said, everybody is free to interpret in his own way. Without Grammar, one cannot write anything, like a Bhashya is evident and need not any periphrastic interpretation.
