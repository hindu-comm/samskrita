Respected Scholars,



I was going through the discussions on the above subject in the archive and if permitted to say the following:

With due respect to the scholars and the scholastic explanations, I beg to differ.

In my limited reading of Sankaras works I have not come across Sankara using such metaphors. If he wanted to say 'don't waste your time and energy on studying the rules of grammar', he would have said it more plainly. I do not think Sankara has expressed such an idea in any other place.

A translation of the phrase or clause 'डु कृञ् करणे’ as 'rules of grammar' to my mind is far-fetched. Sanskrit grammar includes ashtadhyayi, dhatu paTam, gaNa paTham, uNAdi etc. One single 'entry' from one of these works can hardly be translated as 'rules of grammar'.

Bhagavatpada Adi Sankara in his Vishnu Sahasranaama Bhashya in perhaps over hundred places quotes Panini's rules for explaining the various names. The same Sankara would not have intended to say: 'Don't waste time in understanding the rules of grammar; instead chant the name of the Lord'.

He has extolled the importance of 'ज्ञानम्’ over 'कर्म’ in his works. Bhakti, he has held as a stepping stone for jnanam.

So, to my mind, Sankara must have meant, do not waste time in डु कृञ् i.e. in 'करणे' - 'work or action'. It does not lead to mukti. Instead chant the name of Hari/ Govinda, which will lead you to jnanam and thereby to mukti.

Pranams
