The verb भज - सेवायाम् has got a lot of interpretations in English possible for the meaning सेवा, to serve, consume, etc. Here the meaning is to serve Govinda. So it is not new altogether to Sanskrit language. हरिं गुरुं भजस्व is the standard usage. It is to be interpreted with different words, so as to agree with the object of the verb भज् which is transitive verb. भजन means सेवा in general.

  

The other verb भजो भङ्गे has the meaning to divide and from which भङ्गः, भङ्गिः, भागः etc. are derived. Two are different roots.
