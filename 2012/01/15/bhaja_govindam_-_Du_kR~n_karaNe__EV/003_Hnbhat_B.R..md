The above is the mantra in आश्वलायन० प्रयोग.

  

While the first six steps are related with the dative, इषे, ऊर्जे etc. last सप्तपदी is in agreement with the nominative सखा. Having completed seventh step, you become my friend. सप्तपदी सखा भव. The over all meaning is the seventh stepping is for life long accompaniment as some prayoga specified सख्याय instead of सखा.
