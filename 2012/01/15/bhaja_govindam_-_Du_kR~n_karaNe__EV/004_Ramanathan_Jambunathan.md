"So, to my mind, Sankara must have meant, do not waste time in डु कृञ् i.e. in 'करणे' - 'work or action'. It does not lead to mukti. Instead chant the name of Hari/ Govinda, which will lead you to jnanam and thereby to mukti."  
  
  

A similar suggestion forडु कृञ्करणेthat Karma does not lead to mukti,is suggested by Swami Paramarthananda in his discourses on Bhaja Govindam, along with the typical Explanation forडु कृञ् करणे.
