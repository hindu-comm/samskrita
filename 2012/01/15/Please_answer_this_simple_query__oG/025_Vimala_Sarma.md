Dear Eddie

It is not the s which carries the meaning of perfected or elaborated, it is combination of the prefix sam with the root kR which gives this new meaning.



As mentioned before by others the s is just an infix to make it possible to pronounce the m in sam as a labial (using the lips) , and not as the anuswara sang which may be case with other words.
