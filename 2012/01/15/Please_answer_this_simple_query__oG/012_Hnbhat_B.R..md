निष्ठा stands for both क्त and क्तवतु the कृत्प्रत्यय०s and both भूते. Hence nothing by technical explanation will meant for a beginner. क्त is both कर्मणि and भावे, and sometimes, कर्तरि. But क्तवतु is always in कर्तरि and never in कर्मणि and भाव. And all the कृत् प्रत्यय-s are prescribed for धातु-s. I purposefully avoided the use of Sanskrit terminology to avoid confusion.



Exact explanation will be कर्मणि भावे वा क्तप्रत्ययः।

  

There is another thread with quoting rules and etymological explanation at length.
