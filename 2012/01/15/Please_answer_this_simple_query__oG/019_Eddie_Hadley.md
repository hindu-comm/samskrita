Murthy,



 Terminology is specific to its particular field. And cannot simply be transferred to another without causing confusion.



 The field is grammar.

 The question is the function of the -s- in the verbal derivative that is ‘saṃ-s-kṛta’.



 Pāṇini's Gr. does tend to be very specific in these matters, does he (she?) not?



 Presumably the ‘attributes’ are enumerated, and the ‘substance’ in which they ‘inhere’ is identified?



Regards,



 Eddie
