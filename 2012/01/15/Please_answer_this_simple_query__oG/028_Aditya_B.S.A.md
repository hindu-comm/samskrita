नमो नमः

  

As Nityanand mahodaya said, the 's' does carry the import of samavaaya and bhushaNa. From my rudimentary understanding of samskaara, and from the fact that samskurute and samkaroti and samkara are not used in the same meaning, as Dr. Bhat said, I understand that the 's' in samskruta connotes the idea that the language as a whole is not a mere sum of its parts, but a greater entity. In Laghu Paniniyam, I've attached a part where it says 'gnyaapakaadarthaantareshu api sut' in relation to 'samkruta bhasha.' Scholars may please explain this arthaantara. What is certain is that 's' does carry a great amount of meaning, but of the manner, I think, which might not be objectively understood.

  

आदित्यः
