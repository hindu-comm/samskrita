At any rate, it is doubtful in any meaning it is used as the name of a language as a substantive noun rather than an adjective as an past participle. This had been long ago discussed in this group. Right now I could not locate the thread by searching.

  

" *संस्कृतं भक्षाः*। ४. २. १७is the Panini's rule which prescribes "taddhita" suffixes in the meaning तत्र संस्कृतम् = which is explained by Kashika when it denotes भक्ष

  
खरविशदम् अभ्यवहारार्थं भक्षम् इत्युच्यते।  
सतुत्कर्षाधानम् संस्कारः।

भ्राष्ट्रे संस्कृता भक्षाः - भ्राष्ट्राः।

  

क्षीरे संस्कृता क्षैरेयी यवागूः। etc.

  

This guides to some usages other than भूषण, and समवाय. But doesn't necessarily entail any reference to the name of a language as संस्कृतम् and not samskruta bhasha.  

  

"संस्कारवत्येव गिरा मनीषी तया स पूतश्च विभूषितश्च" is another usage of the word  सं संस्कार which can be conveniently interpreted with the संस्कार-s of the speech words and also human being. Only this much was meant by Rajaraja in his Laghupaniniya, by ज्ञापक which follows the words of काशिका -

  

"सम्पूर्वस्यक्वचिदभूषणेऽपिसुट्। under the सूत्र - prescribing सुट्.  
संस्कृतं भक्षा इति ज्ञापकात्॥"

  

Valmiki's usage is here as adjective:

  
यदि वाचं प्रदास्यामिद्विजातिरिव संस्कृताम्।  
रावणं मन्यमाना मां सीता भीता भविष्यति ।। ३०:१८

  

Rest is left to guessing or later formation as applied to the Sanskrit language.
