Dr,

 Regarding the -s- inserted into saṃskṛta.

 In trying to understand the reason for its occurrence, I find the following:

pari-ṣ-√ kṛ

 • (ṣ for s inserted, or perhaps original in a √ skṛ = √ 1. kṛ, cf. upa-skṛ and saṃ-s-kṛ), P. -kṛṇoti (3. pl. -kṛṇvanti, ṚV. ix, 14, 2; 64, 23; p. -kṛṇvat, ib. 39, 2.

 • impf. pary-aṣkarot, or -askarot, Pāṇ. 8-3, 70; 71), to adorn, fit out, prepare, make ready or perfect, ṚV. (cf. pari-kṛ and, Pāṇ. 6-1, 137). \[603,1\]



skṛ

 • = √ 1. kṛ, in upa-, pari-, and saṃskṛ. \[1257,1\]



But I don’t understand *why* it’s there. Is it perhaps simply for euphony, ease of pronunciation?





saṃ

\-**skṛta**

 • refined, adorned, ornamented, polished, highly elaborated (esp. applied to highly wrought speech, such as the Saṃskṛta language as opp., to the vernaculars), Mn. MBh. &c.

For Sam+s+krUta, did you intend saM+s+kR^ita (saṃ-s-skṛta**)?**





Best regards,



 Eddie
