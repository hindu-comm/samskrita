No need to refer to MW, the very often quoted verse confirms the ways the prefix can modify the meaning of a given verb WHICH is a given fact:

  

उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र नीयते।

प्रहार-आहार-संहार-विहार-परिहार वत् ।।

  

Sometimes it may not change, but it depends on the convention of the usages. Even without prefix, the derived nouns carry different meanings. हृञ् हरणे, but हारः - garland has nothing to do with the verbal meaning while both हरिः, हरः, have somehow closer meaning of हरति पापम्, the word हरि has become a case of polysemy:

  

यमाऽनिलेन्द्रचन्द्रार्कविष्णुसिंहांशुवाजिषु ( ३. ३. ७११)

शुकाऽहिकपिभेकेषुहरिर्नाकपिले त्रिषु ( ३. ३. ७१२)--  
as attested by the above Amara citation which have no relation possible with the verbal meaning.
