Murthy,



==>

I am not sure if this is relevant. I have felt that one meaning of "samavaaya" is what "inherence" means in programming languages.

==>



“inheritance” (not "inherence") is one of the three pillars of object-oriented programming.

It is a way to reuse code of existing objects, establish a subtype from an existing object, or both.



I would equate the famous anu-vṛtti with inheritance.



anu-vṛtti

 • f. following, acting suitably to, having regard or respect to, complying with, the act of continuance.

 • (in Pāṇini's Gr.) continued course or influence of a preceding rule on what follows.

 • reverting to.

 • imitating, doing or acting in like manner. \[39,1\]





As for the (non computer) “inherence” takes us deep into inner space, to a land where anything can mean anything – philosophy.

A land where anything can be assembled and disassembled at will.



In reverse engineering a grammatical work, different laws apply. In that land, only grammarians are allowed to assemble at will!





sam-avāya

• m. coming or meeting together, contact, concourse, congress, assemblage, collection, crowd, aggregate (ena or āt, 'in combination'; °yaṃ-√ kṛ, 'to meet, combine, flock together'), GṛS. Gaut. Mn. &c. .

• conjunction (of heavenly bodies), MBh. VarBṛS.

• collision , ŚrS. Gaut. Sarvad.

• (in phil.) perpetual co-inherence, inner or intimate relation, constant and intimate union, inseparable concomitance (= nitya-sambandha, the sixth Padārtha or category of the Vaiśeṣikas, expressing relation which exists between a substance and its qualities, between a whole and its parts. \[e.g. between cloth and the yarn composing it\], between a genus and its individuals &c.) , Kap. Jaim. IW. 66; 69 .

• course, duration (e, with gen., 'during'), MBh. i, 556.

• -khaṇḍana n. N. of wk.

• -tas ind. in consequence of constant and intimate connection or relation, MW.

• -tva n. the state of (being) intimate relation, Kusum.

• -pramāṇa-vādārtha m. vāda m. N. of wks.

• -sambandha m. intimate and constant connection, inseparable relation (as described above), connection by inseparable inherence, W. \[1157,3\]





For now, I’ll settle for “assemblage, collection, crowd, aggregate”, but I’m open to be persuaded otherwise.



Regards,

 Eddie
