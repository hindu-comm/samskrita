which has got a similar discussion.

  

For certain, we do not know what were the languages present in the कृतयुग and only we know वाल्मीकि reported the history of Rama in Sanskrit Language संस्कृता वाक्, or दैवी वाक् which is attached with antiquity as गीर्वाणभाषा or देवभाषा. This is attested by the language used in रामायण. So there is no question whether there was संस्कृत भाषा at the time of व्यास or वाल्मीकि as both have come down to us in Sanskrit language to day.

  

संस्कृतं नाम दैवी वाक् अन्वाख्याता महर्षिभिः।

  

which does not suppose any dating as वेद-s are considered as अनादि-s.
