Hello urmila

i think 'karmani bhootkalwachak dhatusadhit visheshan' is a very non-sanskrit description of the format, normally used in maharashtra state board curriculum :P but yes, thats what it is :) as per sanskrit grammar terminology, it is called 'निष्ठान्त-रूपम्' (क्तान्त-रूपम्) of the root sam+kRu.
