Dear madam,

  

All the discussion for you out of place, whereas Panini specifically adds this as infix आगम before the "k" in many many modified meanings, as explained by Nityananda, related to this form.

  

If it is simple "s" just with the prefix, it has no other form -

  

as in the case of संकरोति, संकरः, वर्णसंकरः, which carry the same prefix but never used with the same meaning explained for संस्कुरुते. Nowhere, the theoretical form संकार is used for संस्कार as in शब्दसंस्कारः.
