Here, with the root as mentioned. Where the -s- is isolated, and there is also a cross ref. to *saṃ-skṛta*, but again, no explanation?

Pāṇ. also gets a mention as usual, but . . .



**saṃ**-**s**-√ 1. **kṛ**  
• (cf. *saṃ-kṛ*; *upa-s-kṛ* and *pari-ṣ-kṛ*), *P. Ā.* *-skaroti*, *-skurute* (*impf.* *sam-askurvata*, *TS.;* *pf.* *saṃ-caskāra*, *Nir.*  
. . .

 • to adorn, embellish, refine, elaborate, make perfect, (esp.) form language according to strict rules (cf. *saṃ-skṛta*), *Sarvad.*  
. . .
