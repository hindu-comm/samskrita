Thanks so much for your help. Does the letter "s" imply "one self" ?  
or is it just used for bridging Sam and Kru and for the ease of  
pronunciation? Please provide guidance. Can "Namaskrutam" be another  
example of such kind where it is a past participle of the verb meaning  
to bow down. Please can you provide example of where the infix of s  
is there in the words? The Japanese friend of ours is a Buddhist Monk  
and will be delighted to know more...and I would consider it a  
privilege to know more in this regard. Thanks once again for the help  
on this Samskrita Google Group.
