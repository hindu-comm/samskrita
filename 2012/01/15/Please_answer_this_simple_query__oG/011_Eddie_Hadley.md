Nityānanda,



==>

  
6.1.131 suṭ kātpūrvaḥ सुट् कात्पूर्वः  
6.1.132 samparibhyāṃ karotau bhūṣaṇe सम्परिभ्यां करोतौ भूषणे  
6.1.133 samavāye ca समवाये च  

==>



The number I have for *samavāye ca* is 6.1.138.

And English is hard to come by, but in French:

> 
> > (L'accrément "suṭ" devant un k est valable entre les préverbes sam, > pari, upa et la racine kṛ-) aussi pour signifier: assembler. >
> 
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > pariṣkṛtam "réuni, combiné". >
> 

Whatever.

Would I be correct in understanding that some kind of distinction is being made about such usage.

And here, with our saṃ-s-kṛta, we have *samavāye ca,* an aggregate – a whole or ‘complete’ thing, a completed/finished/perfected thing.

Which, according to Kāśika, is to be distinguished from some other usage, as referred to in those previous sūtras?



Eddie
