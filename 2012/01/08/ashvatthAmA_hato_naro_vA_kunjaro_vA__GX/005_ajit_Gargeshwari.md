Stories from Ramayana and mahbaratha acts asources meterial for various Kvyas and Natakas. For instance, Shakuntala of Kalidasa Urubhanga of Bhasa and so on  
  
The copper-plate inscription of the Maharaja Sharvanatha (533–534 CE) from Khoh (in Madhya Pradesh) escribes the *Mahabharata* as a "collection of 100,000 verses" (*shatasahasri samhita*).  
  
If one picks up various stories woven in the Mahabaratha and try to trace its origin it will amount to trace the history of the epic itself which has been done by several scholars over the past 100 years or more. All these reaserches are mere conjectures and conclusive evidence may be difficult to arrive at.  
  
Sources of many legends from Indian epics such as ramayana and Mahabaraths has been traced to early Brahmanas and Samitas but when exactly a particular legend was incorporated within the Mahabartha epic may not be easy to arrive. It will always be a conjecture and never a conclusive evidence.  
  
what is the sourcethereof. i.e. of these exact words, not of the story.  
  
Mahabartaha as we all know exists in various recessions such as south India Kashmir, Bengal and so on with Major and minor variations to the upkathas of mahabararath its lenghth in terms of number of verses and etc.  
  
So if one has to answer you question precisely , may never be possible and a probable conjecture depending upon a point of view can be possibly arrived at.
