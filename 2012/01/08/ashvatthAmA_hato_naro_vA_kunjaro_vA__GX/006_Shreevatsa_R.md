In my (very limited) experience, each of the dozen or so times that I have heard the story from different sources, it has always been "अश्वत्थामा हतः कुञ्जरः" as Dr. Bhat mentioned (but I'm also in Karnataka).This is the first time I've seen "अश्वत्थामा हतो नरो वा कुञ्जरो वा".

  

For what it's worth, searching Google for "अश्वत्थामा हतः" and "अश्वत्थामाहतो" indeed shows some patterns.Google has dozens of results for "अश्वत्थामा हतः इति नरोवा कुंजरोवा" but this is easily explained by the fact that someone entered those words in a Wikipedia article, and the possibility that others have been copying that phrase from Wikipedia. (Search in Google for the term

\["अश्वत्थामा हतः" -cryptic\] to filter out Wikipedia mirrors.)

  

As an aside, those results point to Kshemendra's Dashavatara-charitam (महाकविश्रीक्षेमेन्द्रप्रणीतम् दशावतारचरित्रम्), recently mentioned on this group. In the eight chapter which is on Krishna (कृष्णावतारोऽष्टमः), Kshemendra writes:

  

अश्वत्थामा हतः सङ्ख्ये स्पष्टमुक्त्वेति धर्मजः ।

हस्तीत्यसत्यचकितः पश्चात्स्वैरमभाषत ॥७३४॥

श्रुतपुत्रवधस्याथ त्यक्तशस्त्रधृतेर्गुरोः ।

उत्क्रान्तधाम्नः खड्गेन धृष्टद्युम्नः शिरोऽहरत ॥७३५॥

  

So this version also doesn't contain the phrase in the form mentioned.
