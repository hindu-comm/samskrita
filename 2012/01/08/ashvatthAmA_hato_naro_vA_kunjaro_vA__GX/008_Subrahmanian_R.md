The two replies do not directly answer Sri Kolkatkar's query \[nor this letter of mine\].

However, in the mahabharata version that I have seen \[from the 'sacred texts' in the net and the translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli - the verses in the context are slightly different:



115 tad atathya bhaye magno jaye sakto yudhiṣṭhiraḥ  
 aśvatthāmānam āhedaṃ hataḥ kuñjara ity uta  
 bhīmena girivarṣmāṇaṃ mālavasyendra varmaṇaḥ  
116 upasṛtya tadā droṇam uccair idam abhāṣata  
 yasyārthe śastram ādhatse yam avekṣya ca jīvasi  
 putras te dayito nityaṃ śo 'śvatthāmā nipātitaḥ  
  



Afflicted with the fear of a lie, solicitous at the same time of victory, Yudhishthira, beholding a mighty elephant, huge as a hill and called Aswatthaman, belonging to the Malava chief, Indravarman, slain on the field by Bhima, approached Drona and answered him, saying, **'He for whom thou wieldest weapons, he, looking upon whom thou livest that ever dear son of thine, viz., Aswatthaman, hath been slain, Deprived of life he lieth on the bare ground like a young lion.'** Aware fully of the evil consequences of falsehood, the king spoke those words unto that best of Brahmans, indistinctly adding elephant (after Aswatthaman)

And, according to the versions/ verbal traditions familiar to our circles, the statement was 'Aswatthama atha kunjara: hata:' - atha kunjara: in an undertone.



With reverence to scholars
