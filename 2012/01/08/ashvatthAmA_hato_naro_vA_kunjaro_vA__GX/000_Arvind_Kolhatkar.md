Dear Group,  
  
Can someone point out the source from which this vary famous saying  
has emerged. The story is from Dronaparva of Mahabharata but this  
wording is not in it. However, all Indian languages seem to share it,  
meaning thereby that it indeed has an old all-India source, which can  
thus be only an old Sanskrit work. My query is whether that work can  
be identified.  
  
This appears to be a piece of prose as it does not fit into any  
prosodic meter. This is again quite unusual for an old work.
