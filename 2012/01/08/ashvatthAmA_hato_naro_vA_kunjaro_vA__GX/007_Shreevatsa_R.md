Among the results is this book:

<http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzliWzYz34wC&pg=PT105&lpg=PT105&dq=%22>अश्वत्थामा+हतो%22

a Hindi commentary on Banabhatta's Harsha-charita, which in the commentary mentions

"अश्वत्थामा हतो ब्रह्मन् । नरो वा कुञ्जरोऽथवा"

This is in proper metre, so it's possible that some poem containing this was the source... or it's possible that someone took the prose text and converted it into metrical prose!
