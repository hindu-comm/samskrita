I think that after reading these two replies my question still  
survives.

We all know the story as told in the Dronaparva Adhyaaya 166. The  
relevant verse, as I could see i , and as pointed out by Dr Bhat is

तमतथ्यभये मग्नो जये सक्तो युधिष्ठिर:।  
अव्यक्तमब्रवीद्राजन् हतः कुञ्जर इत्युत॥ ७.१६५.१०६.

However, it is obvious all over India this story is generally told as  
'अश्वत्थामा हतो नरो वा कुञ्जरो वा'. (If you enter this phrase in  
Google you will get dozens of responses from all over India explaning  
it, thus proving that the phrase is known in this exact form all over  
India. If that is so, the question I ask is, what is the source  
thereof. i.e. of these exact words, not of the story.

(Venisamhar, in Act 3, has the same story presented thus:

अश्वत्थामा हत इति पृथासूनुना स्पष्टमुक्त्वा  
स्वैरं शेषे गज इति किल व्याहृतं सत्यवाचा।  
तच्छ्रुत्वासौ दयिततनयः प्रत्त्ययात्तस्य राज्ञः  
शस्त्राण्याजौ नयनसलिलं चापि तुल्यं मुमोच॥)
