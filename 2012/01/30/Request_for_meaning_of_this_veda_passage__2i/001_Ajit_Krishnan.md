namaste,

  

The portion basically amounts to "May the devas be pleased with my previous prayer, and grant me favour".

  

A quick search shows this to be section 1.1.13.3 from the taittiriya samhita. A translation is available from
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yv/yv01.htm>. Searching for "Accepting this supplication" will get you to the right spot.

  

This kind of translation / commentary is totally useless as an end-product, but can be quite useful as a catalyst to understand the text.

  

Incidentally, the first part of this anuvaka, which precedes your quote ("vAjasya mA ... prajAm yoniM mA nirmRkSham") is quite interesting. 



sasneham,

  

 ajit
