Dear Prof.Voevodsky,

  

This is a very very late reply, but you can do either of the following:

  

1\. As Misraji suggested, use an online transliterator, like<http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript> or<http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/sanskrit/transliterate.html> or Google Transliteration or many other available transliteration tools, so that typing something like STai results in "ṣṭai", which you can copy and paste.

  

2\. For Mac OS X:

Install the EasyUnicode keyboard layout by Toshiya Unebe:

\* It is available at <http://www.palitext.com/subpages/PC_Unicode.htm> and documented at<http://ebmp.org/p_easyunicode.php> (also attached).

\*Copy the file EasyUnicode.keylayout to \~/Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/

\* In System Preferences -> Language & Text -> Input Sources, enable EasyUnicode (also check "Show Input menu in menu bar")

\* Now you can change the input source (keyboard layout) to EasyUnicode (from the menu bar at the top of the screen), so that typing Alt+a gives ā, Alt+t gives ṭ, Alt+s gives ś, Alt+x gives ṣ, and so on, as documented.

  

Hope either of these helps,

  
Regards,

Shreevatsa
