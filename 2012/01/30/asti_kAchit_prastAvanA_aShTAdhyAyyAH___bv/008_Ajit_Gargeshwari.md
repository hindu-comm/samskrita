I agree its similar to the word atha used is Brahma Sutras , Yoga sutras etc. I understand ancient sutras act as aid to memory and is not written in a style of a modern book with a forward, preface, table of contents, introduction, conclusion, appendix Bibliography and index etc.  
  
If a mangala is not explicitly mentioned in the text it can be assumed a a Mangala shloka was recited in the composers mind. I agree with the arguments and counter arguments presented in Mimamsa, Nyaya and other works on this matter.  
  
I also agree with the view that we being born 2,500 years or more after Panini composition cannot decide if Panini should have written a preamble or not for a preamble doesn't strictly fall within the domain of a Sutrakara.
