I think Mr. Abhyankar's idea of his relying only on the original text for the study is inspired by our Great revolutionary writer of 18th century Jagannatha Bhatta who boldly declared that he won't rely on others compositions:

  

  

निर्माय नूतनमुदाहरणानुरूपं काव्यं मयात्र निहितं न परस्य किंचि

किं सेव्यते सुमनसां मनसापि गन्धः

कस्तूरिकाजननशक्तिभृता मृगेण?

  

who propounded his own theories in Literary Criticism against the earlier rhetoricians supplying examples from his own poetic compositions as and when needed as example without following any poem of others.

  

I was reminded of this rhetoric question when he chose a fresh approach of learning without relying on any primary texts. If they could do it, why he could not do it?
