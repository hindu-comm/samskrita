You could try the three volume 'Asthadhyayi-bhashya-prathamavritti' by Pandita Brahmadatta J Jijnasu. It is designed to be an introductory text following the order of the Asthadhyayi and gives the basic meaning of each sutra plus examples and a very useful section in the back showing the prakriya for each example. I use it and would recommend it.

  

Apologies for writing in English rather than Sanskrit due to paucity of time.
