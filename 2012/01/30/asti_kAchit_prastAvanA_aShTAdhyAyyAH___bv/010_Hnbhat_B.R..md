Sorry for the typo error in the previous message. The translation of the idea in the verse is thus:

  

Why should a musk-deer endowed with the capability of producing musk, should think of the fragrance of the flowers for it? When he himself can compose the poetry, why should he rely on others' poems for examples to expound his theory?

  

This is the idea of the rhetoric question in the second half. Congratulations and best wishes to the endeavor of Abhyankar in his learning approach.
