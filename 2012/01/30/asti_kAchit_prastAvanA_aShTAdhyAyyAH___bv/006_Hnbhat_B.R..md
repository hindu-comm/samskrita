This is really a question worth answering.

  

मङ्गलादीनिमङ्गलमध्यानि मङ्गलान्तानि हि शास्त्राणि प्रथन्ते वीरपुरुषाणि च भवन्त्यायुष्मत् पुरुषाणि चाऽध्येतारश्च मङ्गलयुक्ता यथा स्युरिति ॥  

  

if by preamble, this Mangala is meant and the purpose of this preamble is different than a preamble to any rule under any Code of Law which serves to understand scope of the meaning of the words used in specific or technical sense. In Ashtadhyayi, it is already present in the form of माहेश्वरसूत्र-s which serves as the key to all the technical terms coined and used in the body of Ashtadhyayi. The ascription of these Maheshvara themselves serve as Mangala also in the context of a शास्त्र. This is accepted if these 14 Maheshvare Sutra=s are accepted as composed by Panini himself or revealed to him by Maheshvara. If one doesn't consider them as an integral part of the text of Ashtadhyayi, which strictly begins with वृद्धिरादैच्, by an inquisitive mind, the मङ्गल required by a शास्त्र is served by the word वृद्धि itself in the initial position in the सूत्र, as subject predicate order is reversed in the initial Sutra to accommodate this Mangala by the use of the word denoting prosperity. Otherwise, just like अदेङ् गुणः = अद् एङ् are termed as गुणः (=bhavati) which is the normal prose order of subject + predicate. Since the meaning is not dependent on the word order  as in English, it could be changed conveniently for the requirement of metrical structure. In prose order it can be some times changed as in this encrypted style. as वृद्धिः आदैच्. The meaning is the same. वृद्धिः (denotes) आद् ऐच्. The word order is usually important in technical texts, is called उद्देशविधेय relation between the subject and the predication.

  

I think this satisfies the query raised by Ajit. And there is no need for a Mangala, to be a श्लोक also. It can be any auspicious word in encrypted style of the सूत्र-s which do not use any redundant words in their style. It is not mandatory to. It is better to start to with a Mangala, as you can see from the quotation. Prathante are popular with their Mangala-s or they are generally started with a Mangala, and a Mangala in the beginning or Mangala in the end also. It is different from the Mangala in metrical structures, especially in poetry, where imagination plays the important role than the content. Hence in Shastra-s, its scope is also limited.
