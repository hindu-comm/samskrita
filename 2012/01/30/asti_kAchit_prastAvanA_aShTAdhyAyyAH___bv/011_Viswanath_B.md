Shri Abhyandar Mahodaya,  
  
It is inspiring for rest of us to see the path you are taking. I hope we will benifit from that as well, by way of your blog.  
  
Your point about the composers of the kaumudi etc, having studied the ashtadhyayi in original form could be true. However they may not have done it independently, which is really the aspect in question here. In
the good old days, the adhyayana is done with Guru who is expected to be well versed on the topic.  
  
Anyway, please make a path, we will follow as well.  
  
Thanks  
Viswanath.
