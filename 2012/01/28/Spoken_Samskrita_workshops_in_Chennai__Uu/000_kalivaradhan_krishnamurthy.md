Hari OM!



sarvebhyo namaskaraH !



As part of the annual Yugapat Shibira exercise Samskrita Bharati(SB) Chennai is organizing a 10 day shibiram at various venues in and around chennai this year during February-March 2012. These Spoken Samskritam shibirams or workshops are being conducted through out the year as part of SB's efforts to popularize the spoken format of the language among the people and are conducted obsolutely FREE of charge! There is also no bar on caste/community/religion. Anyone above 10 years of age are welcome to participate and learn the language of the Vedas and Upanishads. These shibiramswill instil a sense ofpride and confidence that Samskritam can bea spoken language as our own mother-tongue like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, etc.Participants will be surprised to realize at the end of the 10 day workshop that they are able to speak few sentences on their own in Samskritam in spite of the fact that they did not know even the basic alphabets of the language. These shibirams will also be followed up with regular samskrita classes for learning the laguage with grammar.



Come on and see for yourself the wonder that these shibirams can do.
Just contact theSB volunteer nearer to your place of residence or office and register yourself.



Please spread this information amongst your friends and relatives and advise them to avail of this golden opportunity.
