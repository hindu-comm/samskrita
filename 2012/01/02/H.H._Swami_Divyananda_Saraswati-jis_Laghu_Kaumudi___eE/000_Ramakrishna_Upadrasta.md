namaste Samskrita students,

I recently came across some excellent Laghu Siddanta Kaumudi lectures  
by H.H. Swami Divyananda Saraswati-ji from Kailash (Kailasa) Ashram,  
Rishikesh.

The lectures are simply brilliant and the clarity of Pujya Swami-ji is  
really astounding. He explains many finer points of even  
bhaimi-vyaakhya with such an ease that it all seems too simple! I am  
sure that anyone would be surprised at the rigor in His lectures.

These lectures cover a huge section of LSK \*including\* ti\~ngantas. In  
this sense, it seems that they cover more material than similar  
lectures available at other locations.

The lectures are in mp3 file format, packed in 2DVDs, are 200+ in  
number, and each of them span around 40min, with the language of  
medium being (saral) Hindi. One can obtain the DVDs from the following  
address:

Many praNAmams to Shri Pujya Swami-ji, His dedication to the language,  
His scholarship, and His guru parampara, and the kindness to all the  
people who have made such high quality learning material available for  
us in this digital age. We indeed are blessed to have it available for  
us!

namaste  
Ramkrishna
