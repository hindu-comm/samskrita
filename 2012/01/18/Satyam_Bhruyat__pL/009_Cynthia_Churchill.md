Namaskara to all.   
  
This sounds like a very wise interpretation. I am a psychiatrist and I have often needed to help patients, for the sake of their own welfare,
to accept things they would rather run away from! Sometimes I have to be the “bad guy” in order to spare that person or others greater suffering in the future.   
  
Physicians and police officers also may have the duty to communicate that a loved one is seriously ill or has died. How this is done makes so much difference. Fortunately, most police officers and physicians are now receiving guidance and training on how to communicate better in these circumstances.
