As often happens with subhaaShitaas, once a particular subhaaShita  
gains wide popularity, other crafters start working on it and soon a  
plethora of similar-sounding subhaaShitaas comes into being, often  
making it difficult to tell which is the original and which an  
imitation.

In this manner I know another 'version' of the above-mentioned famous

  
verse from ManusmRiti. It says:

सत्यं ब्रूयात् प्रियं ब्रूयान् न ब्रूयात् सत्यम् अप्रियम् \|  

सत्यमप्यप्रियं ब्रूयाद्यस्य नेच्छेत्पराजयम् ॥

This verse thus carves out a special area where speaking an unpleasant  
truth is recommended.
