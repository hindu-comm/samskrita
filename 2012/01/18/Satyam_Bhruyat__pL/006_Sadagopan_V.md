Namo namah  

I listened once to a scholar saying that "na bruuyaat satyamapriyam" could mean as follows. Sometimes the truth may be bitter.On such cases,
just because what you say is the truth, even then you cannot be harsh in the way you put it across. The truth also should also be put forthin a pleasant way only.
