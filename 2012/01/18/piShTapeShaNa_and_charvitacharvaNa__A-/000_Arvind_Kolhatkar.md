Dear Group,

I have been trying to pin down possible original uses of these two  
words, popular in most modern Indian languages.

MW gives definitions of both these words and, by way of sources,  
mentions ApGr for पिष्टपेषण and पाणिनि iii.1.15, सिद्धान्तकौमुदी for  
चर्वितचर्वण. I take ApGr to mean आपस्तम्ब गृह्यसूत्र.

I have not studied any of these works. Would learned scholars check  
on this and supply the relevant portions of the respective texts (in  
Devanagari)?

Thanks...
