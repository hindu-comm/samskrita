Malolan Mahodaya

My attempt at translation is below:



O Lord! Of all thy parts, thy feet are the most sweet abode of salvation of the great yogins.

It is the wish-filling tree of devotees. O you Lord! May your feet be forever be stationed in my heart (or mind),

Pure Man! Krishna! Ocean of compassion!

Having taken my sufferings, direct me to obtaining fortune and supreme bliss.



Vimala
