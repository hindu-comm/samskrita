The order of Sutras of Panini is a mystery, but there is definitely some grand design behind placement of rules like पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् (8.2.1), आकडारादेका संज्ञा (1.4.1), विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम् (1.4.2) - if they were not stated in the place Panini stated them, we would have had so many अनिष्ट forms.  
  
Perhaps now that [Perelman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) has solved the [Poincaré conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture) problem and even declined the [million dollar award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems), maybe the math experts here like Gérard Huet can convince the Clay Mathematics Institute to announce a million dollars for whoever derives the order of Ashtadhyayi mathematically. :)
