Another Uddanda Sastri Quote -



भाषाकविनिवहोयम्

दोषाकरवत् विभाति गगनतले ///

प्रायेण वृत्तहीन:

सूर्यालोके विनष्टगोप्रसर: //



This group of local langauge poets (Referring to Malayalam poets)

shine like the moon in the sky.

Mostly not round

without spreading any light when the sun's rays appear.



This has a double meaning. As applied to Malayalam poetry –

mostly without having any meter, with the onslaught of learned persons their words lose their meaning.
