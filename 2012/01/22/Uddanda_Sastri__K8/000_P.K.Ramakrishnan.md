Uddanda Sastri hailed from Kanchiipuram in Tamil Nad.

He had heard about Samoothiri of Tali, Kozhicode, Kerala,

as a patron of Sanskrit scholars. In one of his first visit to

him he addressed him thus.

  

उद्दण्ड: परदण्डभैरव भवद्यात्रासु जैत्रश्रियो

हेतु: केतुरतीत्य सूर्यसरणीं गच्छन् निवार्यस्त्वया /

नो चेत् तत्पुटसंपुटॊदरलसत् शार्दूलमुद्राद्रवत्

सारंगं शशिबिंबमॆष्यति तुलां त्वत्प्रेयसीनां मुखै: //

  

Meaning is clear for those who know Sanskrit.

  

Probably he became knwon as Uddanda from this sloka.

Now no one knows his real name.
