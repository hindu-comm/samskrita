I am sorry. Just I got the correct explanation for your reply. As I had informed, the word सखि is of fixed gender masculine. It is affixed with feminine suffix "ङी" to get the feminine form सखी in classical language obligatorily and in Vedic language it is variable with and without the suffix as in the masculine gender, just like the word आत्मन् at the end of the compound as adjective to qualify any noun in the feminine gender.



  

  

सखा सप्तपदी भव.



The other variant सप्तपदा is also available in some other गृह्यसूत्र-s where it is clear the word सप्तपदी is feminine. सप्तानां पदानां समाहारः - सप्तपदी-गमनम् is another usage in the feminine as derived thus.

  

On the whole I am not sure of the translation provided by you. In all the sentences, विष्णुत्वान्वेतु is the part of the मन्त्र 

सखा सप्तपदी भव, इषे विष्णुस्त्वामन्वेतु or मामनुव्रता भव according to the गृह्यसूत्र-s.

  

There is something more than literal meaning needed for translating the sentences in the respective texts, concordance with the ritualistic practices. Hence I didn't try any translation of my own. There are interpreted in गृह्यप्रयोग-s in different ways as pointed out by Ajit. EkagnikANda contains the original "mantra"s indicated for the rite सप्तपदी which are taken by different writers of गृह्यसूत्र-s and the writers of प्रयोग-s (manual or a practical guide to the सूत्र-s) one of which is posted by Ramakrishnan.
