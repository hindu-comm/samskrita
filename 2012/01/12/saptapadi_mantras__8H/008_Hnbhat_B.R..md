I know that I do not know either GrihyasUtra-s or ekAgnikaNDa or the commentaries.

  

But the simple explanation of the words sakhA saptapadI - is one friend having tread seven steps.

  

And for the doubt of Ajit, Sanskrit Gender system in grammar is divided independent of sex division in daily life unlike English Language. Hence a wife can be called bhAryA, gRhiNI vs. gRuhI, or darAH (always in masculine gender, plural) or kalatram (always in neuter gender). So the word used here is being a substantive word with a fixed grammatical gender denoting a friend in general, it doesn't change its form if it is applied to feminine. The counterpart of this word, sakhI is generally derived from the masculine gender word "sakhi" is conjugated like other feminine words used for females. If the grammatical gender agrees with the sex based gender system, it is agreeable to us. Otherwise we may feel somewhat irksome. But Sanskrit uses irrespective of sex division in the daily life.

  

For grammatical analysis.

  

sakhA is the form in the nominative singular in the masculine gender and ekapadI is also carry the same case, gender and number. No need to change it anyway to feminine form, though its usage may differ according to the context with different derivations.

  

ekaH pAdaH asyaa astIti ekpadI, paada is replaced with pada. In this case, it is "pada" which takes in suffix, ekam padam asya astIti - ekapadin([m.n.sg](http://m.n.sg). ekapadI). In the feminine, it would be ekapadA, dvipadA etc.

  

In this case, it can be taken as the common gender system of English and no agreement with sex division need be insisted. This is my personal opinion.
