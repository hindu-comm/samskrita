namaste,

  

\> one more doubt.

  

  

I am attaching the traditional commentary on the mantras found in the ekagni-kanda. Notice that the seventh item here is "saptabhyaH hotrAbhyaH".

  

  

\> i was especially baffled by 'sakhaa'

  

  

I don't know much about the rig veda prayoga. Sorry.

  

A general comment on veda mantras -- vedic mantras are said to have unbelievable power, and can lead us to the highest truths. Today, they are mostly used in contexts that have to do with everything except the pursuit of this truth. Naturally, in many cases, the mantras don't quite fit. Explanations are full of linga-vyatyaya, puruSha-vyatyaya etc. IIRC, in the taittiriya brahmana, sAyana says that this saptapada mantra is used to laud the person from whom the yajamAna of the somayagya buys the soma plant (probably a man).

  

Over time, traditions change. Older rituals are abandoned, and new traditions are adopted. For example, the upanayana loses relevance and is slowly replaced by a newer vidyArambha ritual. We all know that sarasvatii is the godess of knowledge. So, somebody searches the veda, finds mantras with the word "sarasvatii" in it, and uses it for the new ritual. There is nothing wrong with this, but mantras are being used in new contexts, and may not be aptly chosen in some cases.

  

sasneham,



 ajit
