नमस्ते,

  

\> what is the source?

  

The various vedic traditions use slight variations of this mantra for the saptapadi. What you have seems to follow the Rig veda tradition. It is found in the ashvalAyana gRhya sUtra. The krishna yajur veda hasit's variantin the taittiriya brahmana(though the context given by sayanais completely different). It is also found in the taittiriya mantra-prashna (ekagni kanda) in the marriage context.





\> who is saying this to whom? bride to groom or groom to bride?

  

The groom says this to be bride, as he leads the bride through 7 steps.

  

\> what are the meanings of these verses?

  

The basic construction is "विष्णुः त्वा अन्वेतु (एतर्थम्)". अन्वेतु = अनुगच्छतु. किमर्थम् ? इषे = अन्नाय, ऊर्जे = बलाय etc There are 7 such items that we request Vishnu to bestow on the bride. The standardtranslations and commentaries for words like ऊर्ज् in this mantra are pretty lousy. Looking at all of the meaning of the roots in a dictionary gives us a much more reasonable, much richerexplanation.This is difficultto translate.



मम अनुव्रता भव etc, are specific to some traditions, andbasicallyaks for peity from the wife.



sasneham,



 ajit
