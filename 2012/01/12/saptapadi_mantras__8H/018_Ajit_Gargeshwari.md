Please ignore my previous two mails on this thread they were sent by mistake.  
  
First Step**  
  
**Bridegroom Says  
"Om esha ekapadi bhava iti prathaman"   
"My beloved, our love becomes firm by your walking one step with me. You will offer my food and be helpful in every way. I will cherish you and provide for your welfare and happiness and that of your children.  
  
Bride Says  
"Dhanam dhanyam pade vadet"   
"I humbly submit to you, my lord. Kindly give me the responsibility of the home, food and finance. I promise you that I shall fulfil all responsibilities towards the welfare of the family and the children.  
  
Second Step   
  
Bridegroom Says  
"Om oorje jara dastayaha"  
"My beloved, now you have walked the second step with me. Fill my heart with strength and courage and together we shall protect the household and the children."  
**  
**Bride Says

"My love, I will love you with single minded devotion as my husband. I will treat all other men as my brothers. My devotion to you is that of a chaste wife and you are my joy. This is my commitment and my pledge to you."  
**  
Fourth Step**

"Om mayo bhavyas jaradastaya ha"  
"My beloved, it is a great blessing that you have walked four steps with me. You have brought auspiciousness and sacredness into my life. May we be blessed with obedient and noble children. May they live long."  
**

"Lalayami cha pade vadet."  
"My lord, I will adorn myself from head to toe with flowers, garlands and ornaments, and anoint myself with sandalwood paste and fragrance for your sake. I will serve you and please you in every way I can."

"My beloved, now that you have walked five steps with me, you have enriched my life. May God bless you. May our loved ones live long and share in our prosperity."  
  
**Bride Says**

"My Lord, I will share your joys and sorrows. Your love will make me trust and honour you. I will carry out all your wishes."  
  
**Sixth Step**  
**  
Bridegroom Says **  
"My beloved, you have filled my heart with happiness walking six steps with me. May you fill my heart with joy and peace at all times and seasons."  
**  
Bride Says**  
"Yajne home shashthe vacho vadet."   
"My Lord, in all acts of righteousness, in material prosperity in all enjoyment and divine acts, I promise you I will participate and I shall always be with you."  
**  
Seventh Step **  
**  
Bridegroom says**  
"Om sakhi jaradastayahga."  
"My beloved, as you walked the seven steps with me, our love and friendship became eternal. We experienced spiritual union in God. Now you have become completely mine and I offer my life to you. Our marriage will be forever.  
  
**Bride Says**  
"Attramshe sakshino vadet pade."  
"My Lord, as per the law of God and the holy scriptures, I have become your spouse with the taking of the seventh step. Whatever promises we gave, we did so with a pure mind. We will be truthful to each other in all matters. We will love each other forever."  
  
Aliter to the same process in marriage  
  
Sapthapathi:  
Step 1.:- Ekamishe - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
Step 2.:- Dhve Oorjve - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
Step 3.:- Threeni Vruthaya - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
Step 4.:- Chathvaari Maayo - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
Step 5.:- Pancha Pasubhyaha - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
Step 6.:- Shadru Thubhyaha - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
Step 7.:- Sapth Sapthabhyaha - Vishnuthva - Anvethu -  
  
"Sakaa -Sapthapadha -bhava Sakaayov -Saptha padhaa- Bhaboova  
Sakyam -the' -Ghame'yam Sakyaath -the' Maayosham- Sakyan me'  
Maayosta -Samayaava -Samayaava Sangalpaavahai -Sampriyov  
Rosishnu -Sumanasyamanov Ishamoorjam - abhi -Savasaanov  
Managhumsi -Samvrathaas smu Chiththaani -Aakaram -Sathvamasi  
Amooham -Amoohamasmi saa -Thvam -dhyowraham  
Pruthivee thvam -Retho' aham -retho' Bhruthvam -Manohamasmi  
-vak thvam -Saamaa ham asmi -Rukthvam -Saamaam  
Anuvradhaa -bhava Pumse' Pumse' -Puthraaya -Veththavai  
Sriyai -Puthraaya -Veththavai ehi -Soonrurute'\|\|"  
  
Sapthapathi:  
The bridegroom(BG) gets up from the seat holding the right hand of the bride(B). He then goes round the Holy Fire (Agni) from the right side, by lifting the right feet of B step by step. This is done for seven steps. With each step, he recites a mantra addressed to B, with the following meaning.  
  
"Let Lord Maha Vishnu follow each one of your steps for the following specific purposes.  
  
Step 1: To give you unlimited food.  
  
Step 2. To give you excellent health and energy.  
  
Step 3. To make you perform your vrithas (rituals) as ordained in Vedas, during your life time.  
  
Step 4. To give you happiness in life.  
  
Step 5. To make your cows and good animals to grow in strength and in numbers.  
  
Step 6. To make all the seasons be beneficial to you.  
  
Step 7. To make the homams (sacrifices to be done in Holy Fire) to be performed by you in your life as ordained in Vedas, successful and free from hindrances."  
  
Obviously, the idea behind this is to pray to Lord Vishnu, the protector of life, for his blessings in marital life.  
  
BG then recites a mantra to convey the following meaning:  
  
"Sakaa -Sapthapadha -bhava Sakaayov -Saptha padhaa –Bhaboova"  
By these seven steps you have taken with me, you have become my best friend.  
  
"Sakyam -the' -Ghame'yam Sakyaath -the' Maayosham -Sakyan me"  
I will never move out of this relationship. God has united us in this bondage.  
  
"Maayosta -Samayaava -Samayaava Sangalpaavahai –Sampriyov"  
We shall perform all activities together with love and affection.  
  
"Rosishnu -Sumanasyamanov Ishamoorjam - abhi –Savasaanov"  
Let us be friendly in our thoughts. Let us observe our duties and rituals together.  
  
"Managhumsi -Samvrathaas smu Chiththaani -Aakaram –Sathvamasi"  
If you are the lyrics, I am the music. If you are the music, I am the lyrics.  
  
"Amooham -Amoohamasmi saa -Thvam –dhyowraham"  
If I am the heavenly body, you are the earthly world.  
  
"Pruthivee thvam -Retho' aham -retho' Bhruthvam –Manohamasmi"  
While I am the life source, you are the carrier of the same.  
  
"vak thvam -Saamaa ham asmi -Rukthvam –Saamaam"  
I am the thoughts and you are the speech.  
  
"Anuvradhaa -bhava Pumse' Pumse' -Puthraaya- Veththavai"  
While you are the words, I am the meaning.  
  
"Sriyai -Puthraaya -Veththavai ehi -Soonrurute"  
With your sweet words, come with me to lead a prosperous life begetting our progeny with \[male\] children.
