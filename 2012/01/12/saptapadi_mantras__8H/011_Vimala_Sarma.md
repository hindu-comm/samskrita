In marriages in several communities in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and even Arya Samaj marriages, the bride does have a speaking role. After the Saptapadi, the bride asks the groom for seven promises, and says that she would sit to the left of the groom if the groom promises to uphold each one of them.
