Also your explanation re sakhA - are you saying this is plu masc? I think it  
should agree with fem saptapadI - if it is adj - so it is made fem like  
senA.

It is the reverse. saptapadI is the adjective to sakhi in the  
masculine gender singular as it is clear from the "ekagnikanda"  
citation and there is nothing to reverse this position as "sakhi" is  
always used in masculine gender. Simple translation would be a  
companion who follows up to seven steps togather and becomes friend  
for lfe (in this case).

It can be mitram in neuter gender. suhRd is in masculine gender. They  
are grammatical genders and need not have always agreement with sex  
based gender system as in English. This much only meant by my post.
