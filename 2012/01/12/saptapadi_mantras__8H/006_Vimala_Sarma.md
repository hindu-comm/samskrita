Dear Yaajushi

Here is my interpetation

ekapadI is an fem adjectival phrase from ekapada - so it means -female person having or taking one step



*sakhA saptapadI bhava sA mAmanuvratA bhava*

SakhA is made fem from sakha for masc word sakhi at the end of compounds - changes to sakha - which means "accompabnied by" or "attended with" .



So it can be translated as "*Be a ( female) companion; be she who participates in matters pertaining to my (religious) vows*"



Learned friends on this site can correct any mistakes.
