Bhatt Mahodaya

some roots such as pad take long I to make feminine see Whitney p 135 para 367. It is non-standard in vedic (older usage). He gives example of pApa taking both pApA and in older language - pApI.

Also your explanation re sakhA - are you saying this is plu masc? I think it should agree with fem saptapadI - if it is adj - so it is made fem like senA.

I know that I do not know either GrihyasUtra-s or ekAgnikaNDa or the commentaries.
