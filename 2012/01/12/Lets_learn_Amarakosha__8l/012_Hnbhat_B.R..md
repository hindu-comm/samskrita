Anyone following the method used by Amarasimha for understanding the scheme has utilized in his lexicon. He has collected and arranged in a division based on the contents in groups and sub groups. But this does not give the words like our modern dictionaries in alphabetical order and he expects to identifying them from the forms in the nominative and understand the gender and ending of these terms from these forms. Somewhere he will explain gender and number where it is obligatory. This and many other things how to read and understand the Lexicon-cum-Thesaurus he has given in the introductory verses, before he starts the actual collection in the svarga-varga. So before proceeding, try to understand fully the system he has used and then it will be automatically understood. But he expects the reader, to be able to identify the stem and gender from their forms in nominative case, singular, duel or plural in general. The syntax varies from section to section. At least, one is expected to have learnt शब्दरूपावली by heart so that he could identify the शब्द-s and can decline them in all the cases. While this is a pre-requirement for learning Amakrakosha which ensures the learner identifies the synonyms of any word as given in the Amarakosha and able to decline them in different cases in his own sentences. Grammar comes only at a later stage and this much is enough to understand a poetry generally. Commentary may help to understand the group of synonyms under each head. This is my sincere advice for all the members of the learning group of Amara as sponsored by Adithya.

  

Here is online Amarakosha interface:

I should be able to provide one with English translation for the synonyms. Right now I could not find itl
