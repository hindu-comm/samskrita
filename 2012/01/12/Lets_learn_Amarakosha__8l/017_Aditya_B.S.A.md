Hi, Dipak. Learning Amarakosha is basically a two-pronged effort. You learn the shlokas and also their meanings. You need to do both to achieve a good understanding of the grantha. I'm quite a novice to Sanskrit myself, but I've done a few basic things like learning simple grammar, declensions etc. My advice to you would be to come on-board with this effort and learn the shlokas first, and when it comes to their meanings, learn them slowly as you advance in your knowledge of Sanskrit. I intend to do the same.

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः
