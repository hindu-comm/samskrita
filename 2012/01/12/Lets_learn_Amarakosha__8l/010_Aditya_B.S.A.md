नमो नमः

  

Thanks for your responses. In view of there being members in various time zones, it might be better for this to happen via Ustream, so the sessions are stored in their server and you can stream off it or download, *if* you're unable to attend live. Saves me the trouble of having to upload separately as well.

  

Log in to [www.ustream.tv](http://www.ustream.tv), search for 'amarakosha group' and subscribe to the channel.

  

Vimala bhagini, Sydney's 5.30 hrs ahead so I'm guessing you can't make it live at 8.30 pm IST.

  

Those who attend live will have the advantage of a regular timeline, which usually plays a big role cumulatively when learning step by step.

  

Regards,
