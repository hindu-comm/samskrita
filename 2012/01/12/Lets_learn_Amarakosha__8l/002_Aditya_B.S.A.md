नमो नमः

  

Srikanthan mahodaya, Shobha bhagini, thanks for responding! I've uploaded the pdf of Amarakosha with Mahesvara's commentary (which I got off the Digital Library Of India using the DLID downloader). You can download the pdf from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?zsljsg8lwbar1qv). Also download the[swargavarga mp3.](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?kaz1qpps1tm9mcj)

  

These sessions will happen over Skype.The MO is simple. A step-by-step anuvaada-krama wherein 1st step involves repeating 1 pada, 2nd step - 2 padas, 3rd step - 3 padas, and 4th step the full padya. You look at the script, hear the audio, and repeat. (you will be hearing me repeat it thrice, and you repeat along with me.)The swargavarga has 74 couplets, and if we go at the rate of 12 per week (a brisk yet manageable pace if the covered portion is repeated once everyday), we should have it down in a month and a half. 4 sessions per week are necessary, plus 1 session per module learnt dedicated towards word-meanings and etymology. The key is to internalize it so that we're not just rote-learning but also making active associations between meaning and word.

  

The sessions start in the second week of Feb, and regarding the schedule, we could doThursdaythrough Sunday, 8.30 pm to 9.00 pm IST, if that's any better than what was proposed previously.

  

Bottom-line is we gotta make a committed effort to learning. Hope we get more enthu-cutlets to enlist for this in the coming days! :D

  

Regards,

  

आदित्य:
