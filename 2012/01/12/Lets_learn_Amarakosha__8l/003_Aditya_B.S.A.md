sनमो नमः

  

Shan, you're right about IST, 8.30 pm to 9.00 pm. About preferring a certain age group, what I'm really looking for is zeal and persistence. One of my weaknesses is that my motivation is easily affected by those around me, and it swings both ways, so if I surround myself with enthu-cutlets, things work out better. If you're a 60 year old with infectious self-motivation, there could be nothing better for this learning effort :)

  

Ajit, I value your suggestion for its intent to reduce the laboriousness of this effort. I have been studying a small excerpt of Amarakosha which is prescribed in the study material for the Kavya exam in Karnataka. When I come across a word in a story or a padya which I have studied in the amara, the satisfaction of knowing it at a glance is an enriching experience, to say the least. So the question is, on what principles has the reduction of amara been achieved in amarasAra? I seek your clarification on this. Another point is, amara is like a peek into the diversity of life on a scale that is quite astounding for microwave shoppers like me. That's a major driving point behind this undertaking to learn it.

  

Mkondamudi, I will try to keep posting mp3s of the sessions so you can keep up. The main reason behind making this a group initiative is to try and provide some impetus to keep the effort going until the goal is reached. Interaction between members, which indicates steady, individual and collective progress, is a great impetus. So if you, or anyone for that matter, seeks to be a part of this, I would encourage you to touch base at least once a week and update everyone on your progress once the sessions are underway.

  

Shobha bhagini, thanks for your commitment. Like you said, this is gonna be really good :)

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः

  

p.s - Anyone who can spare some time once a week to explain 12 padyas worth of words, please consider helping out a few interested students of Samskritam.
