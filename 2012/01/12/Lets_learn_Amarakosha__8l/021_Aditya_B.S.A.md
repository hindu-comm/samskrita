1\. We have 8 people registered for the Amarakosha Group at [ustream.tv](http://ustream.tv). For others who want to register, you must first login to the website via gmail or fb or create a new account for the website. Then, in the search bar, type 'Amarakosha Group' and you'll find the channel. Click on the channel and you'll be led to the channel's page. There click 'Join Crowd' to get notifications about when the channel's gonna broadcast.

  

2\. We start on the 9th of Feb, Thursday, as previously discussed. 8.30 pm to 9.00 pm IST. Thursday through Sunday. Please download the svargavarga [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?kaz1qpps1tm9mcj) and also to the amarakosha [script](http://www.mediafire.com/?zsljsg8lwbar1qv). Please try to go through the first four shlokas and understand the manner in which the namalinganushasanam is effected. (I'll try to put up an mp3 explaining the same in the meantime).

  

3\. You'll get a notification about the event in your mailbox. I'll be notifying on this thread also, in advance. You don't need the mp3 for the session. You'll be hearing the mp3 through the broadcast, and I shall be repeating thrice, in a manner that I hope is clear and understandable. You just have to repeat along.

  

4\. If someone has the sudha commentary to Amarakosha, please upload the same here for the benefit of us learners.

  

Regards,

  

BSA Aditya.
