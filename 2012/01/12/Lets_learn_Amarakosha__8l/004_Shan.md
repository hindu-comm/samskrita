Dear Aditya,



Thank you for replying the point raised by me.



I am in Canada and I am still working full time at age 78. I did my post-graduate studies when I was on my 40s. So it is a fallacy to assume that old people will not have sufficient enthusiasm.



The timing is such that I will not be able to participate on Skype.



I am also looking forward to your posting of the sessions in mp3 format.



Thanking you in anticipation



Shan
