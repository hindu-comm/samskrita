Dear ShrimallalitaalaalitaH ,

The issue is that the gmail doesnt show the messages to the sender..

They are visible to other members of the group..

I can see all three.

U will be able to see yr message in sent items ..

Only when somebody answers or sends another message, u will be seeing yr sent message in inbox....
