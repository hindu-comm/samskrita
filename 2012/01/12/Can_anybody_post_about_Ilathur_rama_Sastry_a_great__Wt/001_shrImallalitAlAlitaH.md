A few works of Ilattur Rama Swami Shastry, otherwise known as gomatIdAsa, are with me. They have introductions which deal with details of Rama Kavi.  
I'll need time to type or scan that.  
I've published one of his aShTakam at my blog. You can read it @ <http://www.lalitaalaalitah.com/2011/03/ashvatthagananathashtakam-gomatidasah.html>  
I've plans to publish his devI-stotram at my blog in near future.  
I'll be happy if any one can share his works.
