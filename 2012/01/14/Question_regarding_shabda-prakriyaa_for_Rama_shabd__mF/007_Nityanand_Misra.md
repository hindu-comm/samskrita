Dear Aditya  
  
The problem is not with your understanding of स्थानिवदादेशोऽनलविधौ. It is with your understanding of सुपि च. Whether you are learning from Kaumudi or from  
  
Let's see the sutra with the anuvrittis.  
  
7.3.102 सुपि च \[अङ्गस्य अतः दीर्घः यञि\]  
अङ्गस्य comes from Sutra 6.4.1  
अतः दीर्घः यञि come from Sutra 7.3.101  
  
When a सुप् suffix beginning with यञ् (य् व् र् ल् झ् भ्) follows, then the अङ्ग which ends in अ becomes दीर्घ. You are missing the यञि part which is the precondition for the sutra to apply.  
  
राम + ङे -> राम + य (from ङेर्यः 7.1.13) -> रामा य (सुपि च is invoked since य begins with य् which is यञ्) -> रामाय  
  
राम + भ्याम् -> रामा + भ्याम् (सुपि च is invoked since भ्याम् begins with भ् which is यञ्) -> रामाभ्याम्  
  
सर्व + ङे -> सर्व + स्मै (from सर्वनाम्नः स्मै 7.1.14) -> सर्वस्मै (सुपि च does not apply since neither ङे nor स्मै begin with a यञ्)  
  
राम + ङः -> राम + स्य (from टाङसिङसामिनात्स्याः 7.1.12) -> रामस्य (सुपि च does not apply since neither ङः nor स्य begin with a यञ्)

  
All clear?
