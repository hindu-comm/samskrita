That was a slip on my part, यञ् does include the पञ्चमवर्णs. Everything else stays the same, since the ङ् in ङे or ङस् is an इत् by लशक्वतद्धिते (1.3.8) which you are already familiar with as I can see from your first post.



For the sake of completeness, here is the explanation again with the changes from my earlier explanation in green.



7.3.102 सुपि च \[अङ्गस्य अतः दीर्घः यञि\]  
अङ्गस्य comes from Sutra 6.4.1  
अतः दीर्घः यञि come from Sutra 7.3.101  
  

When a सुप् suffix beginning with यञ् (य् व् र् ल्ञ् म् ङ् ण् न्झ् भ्)follows, then the अङ्ग which ends in अ becomes दीर्घ. You are missing the यञि part which is the precondition for the sutra to apply.  
  
राम + ङे(ए)-> राम + य (from ङेर्यः 7.1.13) -> रामा य (सुपि च is invoked since य begins with य् which is यञ्) -> रामाय

  
  
राम + भ्याम् -> रामा + भ्याम् (सुपि च is invoked since भ्याम् begins with भ् which is यञ्) -> रामाभ्याम्  
  

सर्व + ङे(ए)-> सर्व + स्मै (from सर्वनाम्नः स्मै 7.1.14) -> सर्वस्मै (सुपि च does not apply since neither ङेi.e. एnor स्मै begin with a यञ्)  
  
राम + ङस्(अस्)-> राम + स्य (from टाङसिङसामिनात्स्याः 7.1.12) -> रामस्य (सुपि च does not apply since neither ङस्i.e. अस्nor स्य begin with a यञ्)
