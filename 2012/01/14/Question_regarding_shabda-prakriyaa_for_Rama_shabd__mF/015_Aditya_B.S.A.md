नमो नमः

  

Sure, Dr. Bhat, I totally understand. Let me be concise:

  

In prathama vibhakthi bahuvachana, raama jas becomes raamaah because of prathamayorpoorvasavarnah, after ja-kaara lopa. (as per Laghukaumudi). Here, prathamayoh applies to a-kaara, not ja-kaara.

  

In chaturthi vibhakti ekavachana, raama nge becomes raama ya after nga-kaara lopa (as per Laghukaumudi). Here, ngeryah applies to nga-kaara, even though it has already become lupta-gnakaara.

  

Inference:

  

Prathamaa-vibhakti, sutra ensues after lopa on result of lopa.

Chaturthi vibhakti, sutra ensues after lopa on lupta varNa.

  

Why? If this is the case, how to be sure if a sutra will apply when a varNa in front is a potential lupta varNa? This is my question. I hope I have made myself clear.

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः
