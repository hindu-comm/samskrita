Please study the Laghusiddhantakaumudi well with any commentary followed or any teacher to explain the sUtra-s. No half way understanding the sUtra will help in any way. As you have your question itself lays the pre-condition for the operation, that it should be यञादि, how can स्य which is not included in यञ्-प्रत्याहार operate in this case? Just learn by heart first chapter संज्ञाप्रकरण for the प्रत्याहार so that you can remember whenever he uses the प्रत्याहार and try understand fully the requirements for the operation of any rule. य,व,र,ल ,...... झभञ् is the contents in the order of the माहेश्वरसूत्र to be included in the प्रत्याहार. and स् is beyond that.

  

Mr. Nityananda has detailed the process of derivation.Hence I am not repeating it.
