You should know from the operations. There is no difference in the संज्ञा at all. The only difference is by the difference in the operations of the related rules. So what? If a varNa is lost, the operation of loss itself is technically designed as लोप. This may entail the related operations or not depending on the conditions of operations for the relevant rules and not dependent on what is lost.

  

Still I can't understand your question. I guess you have some how misunderstood some word new to your vocabulary and using it out of context.
