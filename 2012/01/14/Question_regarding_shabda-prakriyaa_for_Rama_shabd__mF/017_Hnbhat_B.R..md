I am sorry. It is ङे suffix itself is substituted, whether it is with अनुबन्ध or without अनुबन्ध. In the rules prescribing, अनुबन्ध-s are attached for specific identification of the suffixes and hence it will work with or without the अनुबन्ध-s It is the same everywhere as I have made it clear in my previous post जसः शी, or टाङसिङसाम् etc. Even if the अनुबन्ध-s are there or not, the सूत्र will work, as it is established in two ways according to the purpose of treatment:

  

अनेकान्ता अनुबन्धाः or एकान्ता अनुबन्धाः which is another परिभाषा dealing with अनुबन्ध-s in general. In any case it doesn't bar the operation of the specific rule with or without अनुबन्ध.

  

Yet I could not understand the purpose of your question as it is not clear.
