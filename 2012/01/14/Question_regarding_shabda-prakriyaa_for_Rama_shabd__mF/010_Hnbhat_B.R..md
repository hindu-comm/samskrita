Again you have not followed from the beginning. You forgot the formation principle of a प्रत्याहार - आदिरन्त्येन सहेता. It is between the it varNa which only happens at ;the end of each of the ShivasUtra-s and taken in the relevant pratyAhAra at the end from the beginning of the pratyAhAra. Not any of the letters in the ShivasUtra-s are taken, but only those marked as इत् occurring at the end of each sUtra, but exception is the "अ" vowel, others are ony the last consonants of each sUtra. You can a discussion on the pratyAhara and the ShivasUtra in this thread:

discussed and explained at length. Here should be another message, containing Sanskrit elucidation of each pratyAhAra provided by some member. It should be be somewhere in Laghukaumudi itself, the total of 42 pratyAhAra-s used generally. With the knowledge of the decoding method you can yourself decode any pratyAhara. If not, here is a link to another message to our group which contains many other utilities for learning Sanskrit, including one pratyAhAra decoder:

For your information, there is one Amarakosha lexicon with ihterlinks to the synonyms and explanations.
