नमो नमः

  

Nityanand, thanks for clarifying. I see now that there was no misunderstanding about the pratyaahara after all. Dr. Bhat, thanks for providing the link. It will be very useful in ensuring that I don't slip up on pratyaahaaras when I'm posing a question to you :)

  

So we're back to the first question in this thread:

  
  
\<1. What is the nature of lopa?>

  

The reason this was my first question is this is the theoretical operation common to all the operations that are involved in this matter.

  

To Dr. Bhatt--who will be quick to point out the fundamental sutram of 'अदर्शनं लोपः' and my half understanding of it--I am aware that my understanding is not even half, and request you to explain this to me: 'दृशे: ज्ञ्यानसामान्यार्थकत्वात् तस्य च निषेधाSसंभवात् उच्चारणसत्ताया एव निषेध इति भावः।'

  

I see two different dharmas that are seemingly contrary in lopasangnyaa (again reiterating that the dosha is in my understanding, and I am aware of the same, and I'm yet to study baalamanorama, which I will commence soon):

  

1st case: (After सरूपाणां...)राम जस् --> चुटू, तस्य लोपः --> राम अस् --> प्रथमयोः पूर्वसवर्णः --> sasya rutvam, anubandhalopah (from upadeshe...), kharavasaanayoh --> रामाः

  

This is exactly the prakriyaa in Laghukaumudi. Prathamayoh purvasavarnah has the vritti, 'akah prathamadviteeyayor**achi** poorvasavarNadeerghah ekaadeshah syaat.'

  

Lupta varNa does not have dharma (achi) required for sutram. Sutram ensues on the dharma of the lopa-karyaanantaraprakaashita varNa.

  

2nd case (as illustrated previously by Nityanand):राम + ङे(ए)-> राम + य (from ङेर्यः 7.1.13)

  

Here lupta varNa 'ङ्'has the dharma required for sutram ngEryah. Sutram ensues on the dharma of the lupta varNa, after lopakaarya.

  

To recap:

  

1st case: लुप्तवर्णस्य वर्णधर्मत्वेन सूत्रस्य प्रसक्तिः न भवति। (prathamayOh poorvasavarNah)



2nd case: लुप्तवर्णस्य वर्णधर्मत्वेन सूत्रस्य प्रसक्ति: भवति। (ngEryah)

  

Both sutras prathamayor and ngEryah have to do with aadesha.

  

If lopa is like Harry Potter's invisibility cloak, in the first case, the ja-kaara wears the cloak, the deerghaadesha sutra does not see the ja-kaara, and works with the a-kaara behind it.

  

In the second case, the nga-kaara wears the cloak, the ya-aadesha sutra however discovers the nga-kaara, and works with nga-kaara only, even if it is invisible.

  

Where has Panini hidden the reason for this one? (Dr. Bhat, I can feel fury already) :)

  

Regards,

  

आदित्यः
