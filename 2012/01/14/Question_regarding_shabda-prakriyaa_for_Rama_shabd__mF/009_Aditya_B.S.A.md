नमो नमः

  

Nityanand, thanks for doing the prakriya so I can understand the process. The commentary on Laghukaumudi I'm using is very basic, and at times misleading.

  

From what you've laid out, I understand that the sthaanivad ya-kaara has suptvam because of sthaanivatvam--but does not have the varNatvam of nga-kaara from sthaanivatvam. Supi cha ensues from ya-kaara's own varNatvam in addition to suptvam. I was aware of the anuvritti, and the root of my misunderstanding was the yaJy pratyaahaara. I'd suspected this.I assumed yaJy included the panchamavarNaas, because nJyamangaNanam comes before jhabhanJ. Why is it not included?

  

Dr. Bhat, thanks for your advice. I'm going to follow it as best I can. I do have the sangyaaprakaraNa by heart. But in this book there isn't a comprehensive list of pratyaahaara-expansions. If someone could please post it here, it would great! Thanks for replying to my questions patiently. Like you said, the need is 'no half way understanding.' That could imply either full understanding or none at all. Since I aim to be closer to the former, I have to cross half-way sometime with the help of those who're already there :)

  

Regards,

I see that the deergha in chaturthi comes from the ya-kaara, which is sthaanivat.
