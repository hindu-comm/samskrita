नमो नमः

  

Happy Pongal all! In the shabda prakriya for Rama shabda, chaturthi vibhakti, from sutram 'ngEryah' there's ya-kaara aadesha for ngE pratyaya after lopa of

nga-kaara by lashakvathaddhite and tasya lopah. That makes it 'raama ya' and then from sutram Sthaanivadaadesho'nalvidhau the aadesha is endowed with suptvam and therefore supi cha sutram ensues, by which anga's dirgha happens, and it becomes raamaaya. In shashti from sutra 'taangasingasaam...' we have sya-aadesha for ngas pratyaya to make it ramasya.

  

My questions are as follows:

  

1\. What is the nature of lopa? From my above understanding it's evident that the varnatvam of the lupta varna persists after lopa. Is there any case where the varnatvam completely dissolves?

  

2\. In chaturthi vibhakti, the aadesha of ngE-pratyaya gets suptvam from Sthaanivad sutram. But in shashti, the aadesha of ngas-pratyaya evidently does not get suptvam, because if it did, then according to Supi cha, it should also have resulted in a dirgha of the anga, making the final result 'raamaasya.' So when does suptvam devolve onto aadesha, and when does it not?

  

3\. In sarva shabda, shashti bahuvachana, there's sudagama from ami sarvanaamnah sut sutram. With the aagama, the position is sarva s aam, and presumably the 'saam' part is now a coalesced identity with suptvam. Here is a case of an aagama entering and the pratyaya's suptvam being unaffected. Again the question, why in the case of raamasya, the sya-aadesha does not result in raamaasya from supi cha?

  

Right now I'm learning from Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi and I'm sure the answers are provided in a more in-depth prakriya, but I haven't grasped enough to get into that, so kindly help out.

  

Regards,
