नमो नमः



Followup observation: sarvanaamnah smai sutram deigns smai aadesha for ngE pratyaya... but here supi cha does not devolve, whereasin chaturthi vibhakthi of raama shabda, supi cha devolves from sthaanivadaadesho'nalvidhau. This must be the culprit sutram. Please explain how to interpret this. If all aadeshas are sthaanivat, then what about aadesha of sya for ngas in raama-shabda, which should necessitate dirgha from supi cha sutram? What am I missing? (Hope it's not terribly obvious).
