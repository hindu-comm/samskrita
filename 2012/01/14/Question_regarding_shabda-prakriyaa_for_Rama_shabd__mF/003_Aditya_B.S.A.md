नमो नमः

  

Thanks for your reply, Dr. Bhat. I'm going to look up Sthaanivad sutram in Balamanorama and revert back after.

You said, \<...in the case of pUrvatrAsiddha, the basis of the operations into tripAdi and sapAdasaptAdhyAyi, which plays an important role for the operations contained in the sections...>

  

What is the basis of this division?

  

Regards,

  

Aditya.
