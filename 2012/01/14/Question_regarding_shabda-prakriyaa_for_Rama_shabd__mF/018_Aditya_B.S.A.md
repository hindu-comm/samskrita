नमो नमः

  

The question, again, is the effect of lopa. Lopa means adarshanam. In the case of raama jas, it seems to be vastutaha ja-kaarasya varNaabhaavatvam, because otherwise mere adarshanam would have prevented prathamayor from happening, lupta-haliparatvaat.

  

In the case of raama ngE, lopa seems to connote not varNaabhaavatvam, only adarshanam, because varNatvam of ngE is preserved for ngEryah to ensue.

  

I suppose we can only understand by going backwards if lopa implies varNaabhaava or varNaadarshana?
