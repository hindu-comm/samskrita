You can check the list here for any "pratyAhAra" in any sUtra:

  

<http://www.sktutils.com/pratyaharaAction.do>

  

Just type the pratyAhAra in the box and you will get the list included in it: Though I had included the thread generally in my previous post, here I found it exactly, where all other utilities are found. Especially the above is specific to the pratyAhAra decoder. Enjoy. Thanks to the provider member of our group for it......
