sthAnivadbhava is not a simple general rule that all the aadesha-s get sthanivadbhAva, but it is dependent on many other conditions where it is used to facilitate some selected functions. There are too many exceptions and modifications and for the first being the only it is not applicable in the case of operations based on a single letter "al-vidhi" which is interpreted differently, alaa vidhiH, ali vidhiH etc. embedded in the sUtra itself. Please verify if any of the operation you want to do with this sthAnivadbhAva, doesn't come within the exceptions in this rule and the subsequent barring conditions, na padAnta-dvirvacana- etc. rule and again dvirvacane 'ci etc. Then put your questions in the order of operation you want and request for a clarification. "pUrvatrAsiddhIye na sthAnivat" is another emendation, in the case of pUrvatrAsiddha, the basis of the operations into tripAdi and sapAdasaptAdhyAyi, which plays an important role for the operations contained in the sections. Please check if the operations you wanted to perform do not come within the purview of the operation of the rule pUrvatrAsiddham.
