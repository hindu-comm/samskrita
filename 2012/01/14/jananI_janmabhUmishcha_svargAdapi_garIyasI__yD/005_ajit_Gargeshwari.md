It is interesting to note that  

The Official Motto is "KAFAR BHANDA MARNU JATI"



the other versions are:

KAFAR BHANDA MARNU RAMRO/JATI

KAFAR HUNNU BHANDA MARNU RAMRO/JATI

KAYAR BHANDA MARNU RAMRO/JATI

KAYAR HUNNU BHANDA MARNU RAMRO/JATI



The "Ramro" can be replaced with "Jati" which essentially means "traditional" or "befitting of ones caste"  

The national Motto in Sanskrit is **जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी**
