This sloka is seen in the edition published by Hindi Prachara Press, Madras in 1930 by T.R. Krishna chary, Editor and T. R. Vemkoba chary the publisher  
  
I did not find the verse quoted in the edition of Ramayana edited by T R Krishnamacharya and published by NSP Mumbai  
The book published is available at Digital Library of India and at <http://www.ignca.nic.in/asp/searchBooks.asp>. ( But the link says a edition by the same author published by a different publisher)  
  
The learned editor of the Critcal edition of Ramayana published as a part of Gaekwad oriental series doesn't mention this verse.  
  
Ramayana of Vamiki edited by K P Parab and published by NSP doesn't mention this verse  
  
So may I request Ramkrishna Ji to provide the complete verse 6-124-17 in any printed version if it is easily available with him as i don't have access to the particular edition of Ramayana the link refers to.  
  
The link gives  
  
mitraaNi dhana dhaanyaani prajaanaaM sammataaniva \|  
jananii janma bhuumishcha svargaadapi gariiyasii \|\|  
  
and the verse asked by Arvindji was

  
  
अपि स्वर्णमयी लङ्का न मे लक्ष्मण रोचते।  
जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी॥
