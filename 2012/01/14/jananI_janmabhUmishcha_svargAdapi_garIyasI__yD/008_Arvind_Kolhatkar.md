Aditya,  
  
I agree with all that you say and that is why I had put the word  
'sacred' in inverted commas, because, despite what you and I think,  
the common belief about mottoes is that they are somehow  
'distinguished' from a thousand other, and equally pithy, sayings.  
  
I, you, or anyone else can coin another phrase to express the same  
meaning as in 'सत्यमेव जयते' but what chance does it have that India  
would choose that creation to be placed below the three - in face  
four, but the fourth is facing backwards and not seen - lions? Zero!  
And why does 'सत्यमेव जयते' get chosen? Because it is at  
MundakopaniShad 3.1.6 and is both 'ancient' and 'sacred'.
