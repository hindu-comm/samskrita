Thanks to Dr Bhat, I came across a detailed discussion of the source  
of this famous line in <http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=1695>.  
  
It appears that this line is of a recent creation, post-1850 and has  
nothing to do with Ramayana. The identity of its creator is lost. It  
has been variously ascribed to Bankimachandra Chatterjee, Pt. Madan  
Mohan Malaviya and others.  
  
What is remarkable is despite not having any 'sacred' connection, it  
has found a place on the national emblem of Nepal! Its creators  
(probably) did not carry out enough research to establish its  
antiquity and lineage.
