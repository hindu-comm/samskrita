I am not sure whether the usage in the original verse is grammatically incorrect or not. But the correction suggested here is definitely incorrect. Even if it takes the freedom of correction, it should be "गरीयस्यौ" as both are in the feminine gender, the adjective also should be in the same gender and not गरीयसौ in the masculine gender.

  

For justifying the usage popular, it can be conveniently bye interpreted with relating it alternatively, जननी स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी, जन्मभूमिश्च (स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी) following the usage of the dramatic Sanskrit ततः प्रविशति राजा, मातलिश्च in the metrical structure.
