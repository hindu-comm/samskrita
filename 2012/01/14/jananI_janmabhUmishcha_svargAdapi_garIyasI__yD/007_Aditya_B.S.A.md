नमो नमः

  

\<What is remarkable is despite not having any 'sacred' connection, it  
has found a place on the national emblem of Nepal! Its creators  
(probably) did not carry out enough research to establish its  
antiquity and lineage>

  

What is even more remarkable are the following assumptions:

  

1\. That the motto of a country must have 'sacred' connections.

  

2\. That the motto of a country must have antiquity and lineage.

  

If the line was not spoken by Rama, it still embodies a worthy sentiment. If the line was spoken by Rama according to the person who penned it, due consideration must be given to the fact that for the author, Rama was the speaker of that line. Upon Rama's return along with Sita, he asks her to pay her obeisances toto Ayodhya. Thus, the vyutpatti of the sentiment in this shloka, even if its origin is unknown, is vindicated on intent. Needless to say, there's no rule about having to agree to it. Of course, what would be nice is some tact, as pointed out on an occasion before ;)

  

आदित्य:
