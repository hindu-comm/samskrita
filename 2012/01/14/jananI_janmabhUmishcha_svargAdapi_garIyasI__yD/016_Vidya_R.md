"This further underscoreswhat I have said earlier in this thread, viz. not only it is not'ancient and sacred', it also appears to be grammaticallyinappropriate. It looks more and more possible that Nepalese scholarsapparently have slipped in due diligence, when deciding to give aplace to it on their national emblem!"  

  

namaste!

  

The following couplet comes in handy for just such a situation. How many of us have our monikers distorted from original Sanskrit into regional / modern convenience!  

  

vidyA

--------

satyaṃ brūyāt priyaṃ brūyān na brūyāt satyam apriyam / (138.1)  
priyaṃ ca nānṛtaṃ brūyād eṣa dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ // (138.2)

  

  

सत्यं ब्रूयात् प्रियं ब्रूयान् न ब्रूयात् सत्यम् अप्रियम् / (१३८.१)

प्रियं च नानृतं ब्रूयाद् एष धर्मः सनातनः // (१३८.२)
