Dear Group,

A friend has pointed out that the popular saying 'जननी जन्मभूमिश्च  
स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी' is grammatically incorrect and that it should have  
read 'जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसौ'. This further underscores  
what I have said earlier in this thread, viz. not only it is not  
'ancient and sacred', it also appears to be grammatically  
inappropriate. It looks more and more possible that Nepalese scholars  
apparently have slipped in due diligence, when deciding to give a  
place to it on their national emblem!
