Now it seems it is Sri Kolhatkar who has slipped in due diligence in suggesting an incorrect correction and passing comments on the Nepalese Sanskrit scholars. Such comments on Nepalese Sanskrit scholars are unwarranted, I have had the opportunity to know several of them and their knowledge of Sanskrit, Mimansa, Tantra, and Vedas, among other things, is second to none.
