Arvindji,  
  
Probably a good place to look for the origin of Nepali motto would be to look into the origin and growth of Gorkha movement in Nepal. This regiment was known for it bravery and immense liking for their Motherland. As I have pointed earlier, the origin must lie in the Nepali language the Nepali version of Ramayana and its kindred Folk tales. As I am not an expert in Nepali language I can not pin point its source in Nepali literature.  
  
Looking for the particular verse is Vamiki Ramayana itself may not show the verse. As we all know Ramayana exists in various recessions and there are many versions of the basic Ramayana story with minor or major modification from different regions of South Asia such as in Java, Bhutan Nepal and within India itself.
