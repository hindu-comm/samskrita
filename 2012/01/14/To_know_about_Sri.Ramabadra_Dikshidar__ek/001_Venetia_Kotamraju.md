Namaste Sethu,

I was going through the Kavyamala and Kavyamala gucchaka series the other day and found several of Ramabhadra Dikshita's works there. All of the pdfs can be downloaded from the internet archive or the Sanskrit eBooks blog. If you'd like me to tell you which volumes contain his works, I can send a list.

Best
