Hello,

  

The easiest way is to use XeTeX (xelatex). Just compile the input file by invoking "xelatex file.tex" (instead of "latex file.tex" or "pdflatex file.tex" that you normally use). Nothing else is required.

  

This will work if you want just the Romanized characters with diacritics. Since you're trying to type "tā" into the document, I guess you know how to enter these characters as input. (Else you can search for transliteration tools, e.g. [this](http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript) or[this](http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/sanskrit/transliterate.html).)

If you need characters in the Devanagari script too, you can try the instructions here:<http://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2011/10/simplest-sanskrit-xelatex-file.html>

If xelatex doesn't work for you for some reason, or you have some other trouble, please reply again and someone will be glad to help.

  

Regards,

Shreevatsa
