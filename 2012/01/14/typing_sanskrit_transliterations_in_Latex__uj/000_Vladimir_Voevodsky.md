Hello,

is there a way to include sanskrit words typed with the US Extended keyboard into LATEX?

For example if write tā in a latex document (for which I have the encoding set to Unicode-8) I get the message:

\*\*\*

Package inputenc Error: Unicode char \\u8:ā not set up for  
use with LaTeX.

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.  
Type H \<return> for immediate help.  
...  
  
l.533 tā

\*\*\*

  
Thanks,  
Vladimir.
