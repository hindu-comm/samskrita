Hello Vladimir,

  

Your problem seems to have been addressed in this link:<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Accents#Related_issues>

  

Typing diacritics and accents in LaTeX is very easy. Please try the commands as detailed in the above link.From the same link, you may easily identify the accent you're looking for (**ā**) as the "macron", which is produced by typing \\={a}. Hope this answers your question :)

  

Guru.
