There is no specific rule to give भसंज्ञा to राजन् especially. Only the usual संज्ञासूत्र-s which defines the technical term भम्\|

  

If you learn and confirm what you have learnt at a step, then you will not have any problem as you progress. But just frog jumps would not gain anymore. This is expected of you by the writer of the primary beginner's texts to सिद्धान्तकौमुदी. Therefore they do not repeat again and again whenever the need arises and expect you to remember what is needed. "Rolling stone gathers no most." can be fine in other fields, but in Grammar, you have to be thorough with each step and steady to leap forward.

  

And as the scheme of the book लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी explicitly suggests, it is only a primary introduction to a selected process of प्रक्रिया, which can be elaborated gradually through मध्यसिद्धान्तकौमुदी, वैयाकरणसिद्धान्तकौमुदी, and the commentaries, on it बालमनोरमा, प्रौढमनोरमा, शब्दरत्नम्, (लघुशब्दरत्नम्, बृहच्छब्दरत्नम्), शेखरः (लघु-शब्देन्दुशेखरः - बृहच्छब्देन्दुशेखरः) graded exercises for the gradual and steady learning.

  

There was already a topic discussed in our forum why should one study grammar at all. I at the very outset replied, not at all necessary to learn the words, and how to use them. It is to be learnt for learning Grammar itself as a science full-fledged of language in itself. Otherwise there are many tools for Sanskrit learning, with which you can generate declensions, conjugations, etc. without even the need to learn the शब्दरूप in the beginning. Here is the link:

Hope there will be sufficient replies for your query at the very outset.
