Aditya,  
  
The question is not "how" but "when" राजन् gets the भ संज्ञा, since it is not always that राजन् is defined to be a भ. The relevant sutra for भ definitions is  
  
1.4.18 यचि भम्  
स्वादिषु and असर्वनामस्थाने are to be continued from 1.4.17.  
  
Meaning "Except for the five सर्वनामस्थान suffixes (सु औ जस् अम् औट्), when a स्वादि suffix beginning with य् or a vowel (अच्) follows, then the preceding form is defined to be a भ".  
  
As I explained in a recent thread, स्वादि suffixes are all suffixes described by Bhagavan Panini between 4.1.2 (स्वौजसमौट्छस्टाभ्याम्भिस्ङे

भ्याम्भ्यस्ङसिभ्याम्भ्यस्ङसोसाम्ङ्योस्सुप्) and 5.4.151 (उरःप्रभृतिभ्यः कप्).  
  
Addendum: The sutra 1.4.16 makes an exception to 1.4.18 by saying that if the following suffix is a सित्, i.e. has स् as an इत्, then the preceding form is not a भ (if it was at all a भ by 1.4.18), but a पद. You can see more details in the other thread.  
  
Hope this helps, Nityanand
