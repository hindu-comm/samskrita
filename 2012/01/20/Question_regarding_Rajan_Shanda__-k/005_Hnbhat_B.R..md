It is not only राजन् but any अङ्ग before the two classes of suffixes, beginning with "y" or "ac". The extension of the भसंज्ञा to other suffixes than these, are "तसौ मत्वर्थे" (1.4.19) the next rule which makes it extended to the preceding forms of "taddhita" suffixes in the meaning "matvartha" even though they do not begin with "ac" or "y" which should be considered in other cases. यशस्वी, विद्युत्वन्तम् etc.

  

The operations to the भ are enlisted in the rules in 6th Chapter fromभस्य॥[६।४।१२९](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/6.4.129)\|\|

onward up to the end of the chapter.
