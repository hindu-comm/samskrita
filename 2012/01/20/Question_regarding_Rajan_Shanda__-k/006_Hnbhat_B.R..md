Addendum:

  

As pointed out earlier, Laghusiddhantakaumudi, has this sUtra defining भ cited in the case of declension of the word विश्वपा in the अजन्तपुंल्लिङ्ग, just before the Sutra, prescribing the lopa:

  

आतो धातोः। । लघुकौमुदी १६७ = पाणिनीयसूत्र ६,४.१४०  
  
as it also pertains to the "lopa" to the word विश्वपा when it is भ as the above quoted number makes it specific. Therefore under राजन् in the section हलन्तप्रकरण it is not cited again.

  

Addendum: to the extension, in the next rule applies to the अङ्ग ending in त् or स्. I forgot to add this detail in the explanation as it is already explicit in the सूत्र itself. Otherwise, if "pada" संज्ञा would have made these as "विद्युद्वान्, or पयोवान्". This rule is again flexible in the case of Vedic vocabulary, which are collected in the next sUtra: अयस्मयादीनि छन्ब्दसि, which otherwise, अयोमयम्, etc.
