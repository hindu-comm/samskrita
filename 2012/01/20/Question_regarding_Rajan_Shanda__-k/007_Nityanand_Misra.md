Thanks Bhat Ji for the additional definitions of भ. To add to your explanation of अयस्मयादीनि छन्दसि, some forms which are examples of this sutra in action are  
  
अयस्मयम् - माध्यन्दिन संहिता 12.63 - The form is अयोमयम् in लौकिक as Bhat Ji pointed out  
मनस्मयम् - शौनकीय संहिता 14.1.2. - The form is मनोमय in लौकिक  
ऋक्वता (ऋच् + मतुप् + टा) ऋग्वेद 4.50.5 - The form is ऋग्वता in लौकिक  
ऋक्वभिः (ऋच् + मतुप् + भिस्) - शाङ्खायन ब्राह्मण 16.9 - The form is ऋग्वभिः in लौकिक
