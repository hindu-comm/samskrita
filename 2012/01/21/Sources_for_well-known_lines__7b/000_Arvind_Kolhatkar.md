Dear Group,

Can someone point to the sources of the following well-known lines?

1\) एकां लज्जां परित्यज्य सर्वत्र विजयी भवेत् \|  
2) आरम्भशूरा: खलु दाक्षिणात्या: \|

I do not remember where I picked up that idea but I had thought for a  
long time that 'आरम्भशूरा: खलु दाक्षिणात्या:' was attributable to  
वेंकटाध्वरि of विश्वगुणादर्शचम्पू. It does not seem so.
