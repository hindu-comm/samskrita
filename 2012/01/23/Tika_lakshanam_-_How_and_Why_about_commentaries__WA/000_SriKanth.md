सभायै नम:  
  
I have just started reading Srimad Ramayana with 3 different  
commentaries (published by Parimal Publications). Though I am just  
stepping into Sanskrit, I could understand the commentary to a fair  
extent. The commentators have done extra-ordinary work in bringing the  
interested reader into Ramayana in some places even going all the way  
into explaining what the च, हि etc in the slokas are for.  
  
It makes me wonder is there any lakshna, rules in writing Tika for a  
great work like Srimad Ramayana. How are the Tika commentaries  
arranged in explaining Slokas?  
  
I could see in some places the commentator like Govindaraja indicates  
with a single word "matup" to indicate the word is matup Pratyaya in  
grammar. In other places he goes on giving quotations from a number of  
works, upanishads, shruti etc.  
  
I am sure there must be some set of alankaras, rules in writing Tika.  
If I am aware of that, that would improve my reading experience I  
think.  
  
Learned scholars may help out. Pardon my English.  
  
धन्यवाद:
