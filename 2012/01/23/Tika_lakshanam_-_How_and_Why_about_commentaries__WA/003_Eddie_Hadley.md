Dr,



==>

This is a general definition of a commentary:

पदच्छेदः पदार्थोक्तिर्विग्रहो वाक्ययोजना \|

आक्षेपेषु (पस्य) समाधानं व्याख्यानं पंचलक्षणम् \|\|



padacchedaḥ padārthoktirvigraho vākyayojanā \|)

ākṣepeṣu (pasya) samādhānaṃ vyākhyānaṃ paṃcalakṣaṇam \|\|).

==>



If I may provide a student's viewpoint:



The work I refer to is to enable the student who has not been raised into the native culture of the text to dicipher a Sanskrit commentary of any level.



It is the product of feedback from the students themselves, of the difficulties they experience.



The good Dr must realise that the direct comparison of one one text with another can only be instructive, after each individual text as been laboured over.





By way of comparison, here is exact text, written to please the student.

The service of पदच्छेदः (padacchedaḥ pada-cchedaḥ) duly provided by the happy lecturers.





I quote:



“The above is given in a verse from the Parāśarapurāṇa that is quoted in the Nyāyakośa.



pada-cchedaḥ padārthoktir vigraho vākya-yojanā \|

ākṣepeṣu samādhānaṃ vyākhyānaṃ pañca-lakṣaṇam \|\|.



These five services correspond, in this same order, to the problems most often faced by students attempting to dicipher a Sanskrit text.”
