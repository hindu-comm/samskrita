Sri Kanth,



I can direct you to a very recent (2007) 300 page work that is dedicated to the very subject.

Describing the standard formula employed by commentators.



It is though, written entirely in English, where even the Devanagari is Romanised, but this Welshman reckons that your English is more that up to it.

Even so, you can view sample pages, content pages, etc. and judge that for yourself.

MatUP is there. (page 81):



 (The possessive suffix) *matUP* expressing constant connection. The condition of being that.







Here is the publishers blurb, which for once does, not exaggerate:



“This volume gives a complete introduction to the techniques and procedures of Sanskrit commentaries, including detailed information on the overall structure of running commentaries, the standard formulas of analysis of complex grammatical forms, and the most important elements of commentarial style. Since the majority of expository texts in Sanskrit are composed in the form of commentaries on earlier texts, this Manual will be of great use to many Sanskrit translators. Furthermore, because many philosophical and scientific texts are written in the style of formal debate using the same basic principles, the features covered in the manual are useful for reading all expository texts, whether they are commentaries or not.”

You can also see in the sample pages, under the section headed ‘0.2 The five services of a commentary’, that apparently very little original manuscript material is extant.



But I can’t confirm that.



Regards,



 Eddie
