I don't think we can set any strict rule for writing Tika and we can  
chose our own guide lines for writing a Tika, if we want. Only read  
and enjoy the Tika-s to increase your knowledge of Sanskrit Literature  
and Language and don't waste time in finding out the arrangement for  
presenting the commentaries or Tika-s.

This is my sincere advice for any beginner. If you want to just to  
know what does a टीका means please follow this thread for different  
conventions of naming टीका-s :

I don't think that makes any difference in your understanding the text.

This is a general definition of a commentary:

पदच्छेदः पदार्थोक्तिर्विग्रहो वाक्ययोजना \|  
आक्षेपेषु (पस्य) समाधानं व्याख्यानं पंचलक्षणम् \|\|.

Commentators are free to offer explanation in any way they feel proper  
for their writing. Please enjoy their style of writing and try to  
understand the text from different points of view presented by the  
commentators, than spending time in unnecessary inquiries.
