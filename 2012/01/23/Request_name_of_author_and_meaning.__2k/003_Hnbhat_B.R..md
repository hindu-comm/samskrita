I don't know who is the author of this श्लोक, but I know it is not Ganesha Upadhyaya, the founder of Navyanyaya, but he is गङ्गेशोपाध्याय, followed by गदाधरः, रघुनाथशिरोमणिः, and so on the lineage of नव्यनैयायिक--s.

  
And I have not heard he was a poet or written any poem. As mentioned in the earlier thread, by MBS Namboodirippad, it is ascribed to Uddanda Shastri, and he suggested अनास्वाद्य गौरीं instead of गौडीं doesn't make any sense so that it was referring to Kunjathu ezhuthacchan

Quoted from the earlier message.

  

And on the contrary, the information I got on the life of Gangeshopadhyaya, refers to his worshiping Kali:

Here is the link to a biography of him and no mention is not made of him being a poet or any poem by him:

Now the choice is yours whether to accept the information you found on the net or the information provided by MBS Namboodirippad from his memory. The link is provided in my earlier post to his explanation.
