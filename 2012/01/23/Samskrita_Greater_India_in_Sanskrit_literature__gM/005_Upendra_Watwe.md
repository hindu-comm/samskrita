Hello All,

Continuing my thoughts about the topic started by Arvindji,

  

If I compare the "golden sparrow" time of ancient India , I am struck by a similarity I find in the approach of people of 20th/21st century f USA
to the happenings and things outside of USA.

FOr example I was asked by one colleague in office is Islamabad was the capital of Delhi .

Or if India was a part of pakistan ? or if we went to office on bullocks/ elephants.

Though there would be the influence of the hollywood films depicting India,I believe such ignorance comes about as one doesnt feel any need to learn about places outside of your place of residence , when your place itself suffices All your needs and ambitions and your nation is known as the prized destination for people all over the world.

Upendra
