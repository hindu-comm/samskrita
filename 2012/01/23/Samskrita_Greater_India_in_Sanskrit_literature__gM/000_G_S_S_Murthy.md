Dear All,  

Historians tell us that roughly during the period 5^(th) century AD to 11^(th) century AD, Indian sub-continentâ€™s soft power extended to what is today Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and China. This is also roughly the period when Classical Sanskrit literature flourished. Is there any reference to this cultural expansion in Sanskrit Classical literature? If the answer is in the positive, details thereof. If it is in the negative what could be the reason?  

Regards,  

Murthy
