"While there is no doubt about the centuries-old Indian influence in  
cultures of SE Asia, I, for one, feel that there is hardly a mention  
of it to be found in the classical Sanskrit literature or the large  
body of philosophical writing and mythological works like the various  
Puranas, Bhagawata etc created between the 5th and the 15th century.  
All works cited by Ajit Gangeshwari are by modern historians. It  
looks as though the learned community of India in the middle ages was  
oblivious of the spread of the Indian culture beyond its borders."  
  

There are several historical documents, inscriptions which refer to the early influence of Sanskrit In South Asia.  
If you need I can point and show several inscriptions, archaeological evidences etc. Mythological works are mythological works so please don't be confused between history and mythology.  
  
Lets raise the issues involved in learned communities in middle ages India versus Europe etc to another thread. Dates of Puranas are not fixed Bhagawata may or may not deal with history if it deals it is incidental. Please refer Hazra and Kanes's works on historicity of Puranas. You can also refer to Pargitar's works
