The Asokan inscriptions in Brahmi extend to Afghanistan and the part of the Old Silk Road. The Vijayanagar empire had envoys in Indonesia so there mustt have been official records but perhaps but none of these have survived the Southern climate.

It is very difficult to find accurate historical works in Sanskrit, as there are in Chinese records.
