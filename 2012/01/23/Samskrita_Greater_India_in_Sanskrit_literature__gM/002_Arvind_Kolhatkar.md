While there is no doubt about the centuries-old Indian influence in  
cultures of SE Asia, I, for one, feel that there is hardly a mention  
of it to be found in the classical Sanskrit literature or the large  
body of philosophical writing and mythological works like the various  
Puranas, Bhagawata etc created between the 5th and the 15th century.  
All works cited by Ajit Gangeshwari are by modern historians. It  
looks as though the learned community of India in the middle ages was  
oblivious of the spread of the Indian culture beyond its borders.  
  
I am not able to account for any reasons for this apparent lack of  
awareness. However, perceptible and pedigreed Indian influence can be  
easily seen by anyone who visits countries like Thailand, Malaysia,  
Indonesia etc., which influence is quite distinct from the popular  
Hinduism of new temples erected by the modern-day Indian communities  
of those countries.  
  
As a curiosity I may mention that there is even a community - now  
dying - of Thai Brahmins who alone are competent to perform some of  
the rituals of the Royal Court, such as the coronation of a new king  
and royal funerals etc.
