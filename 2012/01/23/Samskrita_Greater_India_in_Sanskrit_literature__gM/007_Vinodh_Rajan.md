Hi All,

  

This perhaps off topic to the thread.

  

But there are several Sanskrit Inscriptions found all over East Asian, starting from the Pallava period.

  

Below is a Shloka, inscribed in the Pallava Grantha Lipi in the Ancient Champa Desha (present day Vietnam) by the Champa King Indra Varman in 797 AD:

  

क्वचिदपि वलभिज्जो ब्रह्मजो विष्नुजश्च

क्वचिदपि भुजगेन्द्रश्शङ्करश्च क्वचिद्वा ।

क्वचिदृषि रविचन्द्रोऽपांपतिर्वह्निरूपः

क्वचिदभयबिंबस्सत्वमोक्षाद्बभूव ॥

  

kvacidapi valabhijjo brahmajo viṣnujaśca

kvacidapi bhujagendraśśaṅkaraśca kvacidvā \|

kvacidṛṣi ravicandro'pāṁpatirvahnirūpaḥ

kvacidabhayabiṁbassatvamokṣādbabhūva \|\| 

  

Perhaps,to present a different view point -

  

We must to some search about the Sanskrit Literature of South East Asia.
Sanskrit was thriving there as the court,literaryand liturgical language for several centuries. There should have been lots of native Sanskrit literature produce in South East Asia. We might me interested to know how they refer to India :)
