Namaste,  
  
I am sure you are all familiar with the story of how 'Bruhatkatha' originated. Gunadhya, the author, after having lost the bet, goes to forest foregoing prakrit and sanskrit, and composed bruhatkatha in paishachi. At least this is the version i am familiar with.  
  
Now, the bet, is apparently that the king can't be taught sanskrit in 6 months. His opponent (in the bet) created the *katantra vyakarana* and succeeds in making the king 'learn' Sanskrit in that time period.  
  
I was wondering if there is a copy of this katantra vyakarama available somewhere on web, and if any commentaries exist. Does this predate panini ? I couldn't find much info on web, except that this vyakarana belongs to the *indra school* of vyakarana.  
  
Could any of you throw some light on this topic \[katantra vyakarana\] ?  
  
Thanks  
Viswanath
