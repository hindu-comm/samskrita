Namaskara to all,

  

It is said in a biography of Ganapati Muni that "once he appealed to Gandhiji to make Sanskrit the official language of India. Gandhiji expressed doubt about its feasibility as only very few Indians knew Sanskrit. At this Ganapati Muni took up the task of making Sanskrit easy to learn and created a simplified Sanskrit called "Laalibhasha" and presented it to the elders of the Congress."

  

But I could not find any more information about this "Laalibhasha - Simplified Sanskrit" of Ganapati Muni. Is there is any book on this subject? Any info about this is welcome.  



regards  
shankara
