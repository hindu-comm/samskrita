In my opinion there are two aspects one is Sanskrit language was extensively used in the past and present and its usage in literature, science, philosophy in administration etc is beyond any doubt it has been used for over 2000 years regulated by Paninin and different grammatical school. It might had a pan Indian presence and has influenced several languages of South Asia and several Indian languages.  
  
One can look at the differences between Katyaya and Patanjali which shows the progress Sanskrit Language had made and can be explained if one assumes Sanskrit was a spoken language then.  
  
The second aspect is " Sanskrit as a language" was it ever used as we use English, Kannada, French or Hindi in our daily speech and communications by a large section of a given population or geographical area is for scholars to decide. If the answer to this question is negative then one must accept Sanskrit was an artificial language but it still continues to be a language by an definition.
