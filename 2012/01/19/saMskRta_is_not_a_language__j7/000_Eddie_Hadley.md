All,



Strictly speaking **Saṃskṛta** is not a language.



The definition of **language**, as provided by one of the great authorities on the subject, Webster’s, is as follows.



 1. a body of words and the systems for their use common to a people who are of the same community or nation, the same geographical area, or the same cultural tradition: the two languages of Belgium; a Bantu language; the French language; the Yiddish language.

 2. communication by voice in the distinctively human manner, using arbitrary sounds in conventional ways with conventional meanings; speech.

 3. the system of linguistic signs or symbols considered in the abstract (opposed to speech).

 4. any set or system of such symbols as *used in a more or less uniform fashion* by a number of people, *who are thus enabled to communicate intelligibly with one another*.





By the same convention, we have by way of contrast, **jargon.**



- an *artificial pattern* used by a particular (usually *occupational*) group within a community . . .





Eddie,



 A jargon speaker of the *artificially intelligent* computer kind.
