Unfortunately the italics did not come through in the email. I am  
sorry that I could not guess where they were, either.  
  
In any case, I do not understand Webster's definition (quoted at the  
beginning of the thread) in terms of their exemplars: Yiddish or  
French or English.  

  
\> 1. a body of words and the systems for their use  
\> common to a people who are of the same community or nation,  
\> the same geographical area, or the same cultural tradition:  
\> the two languages of Belgium; a Bantu language; the French language; the Yiddish language.  
  

In the case of Yiddish, which is the community or nation? Is it the  
Jews: But they don't all speak Yiddish. German Jews: Do these even  
exist nowadays? Yiddish was spoken more in New York than Germany after  
WW2. Is the nation the nation-state of Israel: hardly anyone there  
speaks Yiddish. Other than that there never was a nation-state using  
Yiddish. Similar questions may be asked regarding French. What of  
Francophone African French speakers?  
  
Neither Yiddish nor French is spoken in a contiguous geographical  
area. What is this "cultural tradition"? If it is the culture of  
speaking Yiddish (or French) that is a circular definition. Other than  
that, people speaking Yiddish were from heterogenous cultures, and  
much more so with French.  
  
So how come Webster gives Yiddish and French as examples?  
  
From your second email we have the definition and example:  

\> LANGUAGE is applied to the general pattern of a people or race: the English language.  

I am trying to understand the example of English. It is a general  
pattern of which people? Of which race? There seem to be many peoples  
and races among those who claim to be native English speakers.  
  
I am sorry I do not understand the examplars that Websters give for  
their definitions. That leaves me puzzled about how to apply their  
definition and check if saMskRta is a language or not.  
  
I have no strong interest in deciding whether saMskRta is a language  
or not, until someone tells me what difference it makes. I will  
continue to use the same sort of techniques that are used to study  
other so-called languages to study and describe saMskRta: i.e.,  
phonology, syntax, semantics, literary criticism, etc. If someone  
convinces me that my study and understanding can be improved by  
studying saMskRta abandoning language-like techniques and using non-  
language techniques, I am not too proud to accept their help.
