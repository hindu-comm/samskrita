Upendra,



 You have limited your analysis to four different definitions of the one and the same, the one eight letter word - ‘language’.



 How did you manage to ‘prove’ that the one and the same thing, is both a whole thing and 2/3 thing?

 Aristotle who long ago, did demonstrate that Logic, though better than nothing, has its flaws, would be proud of you!



 You must compare and contrast the one, eight letter word with the one with six letters to its name, viz. “ *by way of contrast*, **jargon.”**



 Anyway, acting as both judge and jury is disallowed!

 And the criteria employed must be fully explained and universally acceptable.



 Sensing a need to justify my conclusion is called for, I have now posted the analysis by which I reached my profundity.



 Eddie
