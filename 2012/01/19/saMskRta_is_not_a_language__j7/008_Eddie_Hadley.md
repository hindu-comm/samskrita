Dhananjay,

I am seeing italics, in both  
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/samskrita/>  
and In my local e-mail - "Windows Live Mail.

I see them also in others postings, such as Upendra's.

have a work-around, but I have a feeling you couldn't care less.

The distinctions lay with the attributes of 'language'.

LANGUAGE "general"  
DIALECT "form of"  
JARGON "artificial"  
VERNACULAR "natural"

As an exercise, one may entertain oneself by positioning "Saṃskṛta" in one  
or more, or even none of these places.  
Then try Yiddish, French, or what you will . . .

There are those that would have us understand Saṃskṛta is not of this world  
at all, but there is no label of the 'super natural' category.  
Perhaps we should appraise Webster's of this deficiency.

Personally, I always find it useful to know the nature of the material that  
I'm presented with.  
If it's fiction, then I can switch of the critical faculty and enjoy.  
If it's factual, the reverse is appropriate.

The real amusement comes with every day matters, where to decisions as  
whether, to trust or not to trust, have to be based on rather scanty  
information.

You can find the understanding of such word as you seek, fully explained in  
the self-same lexicon, but there comes a time when one must put down ones  
lexicon and gaze in wonder at the real word . . .

Words are ever but ink stains on a page, or a noise in the ears.  
Understanding is a function or the inner organ.  
The classification is of language itself, and is entirely independent of  
particular peoples or races.

  
In context:

LANGUAGE is applied to the "general pattern" of a people or race: the  
English language.

DIALECT is applied to "certain forms" or "varieties of" a language, often  
those that provincial communities or special groups retain (or develop) even  
after a standard has been established: Scottish dialect.

A JARGON is either an "artificial pattern" used by a particular (usually  
occupational) group within a community or a special pattern created for  
communication in business or trade between members of the groups speaking  
different languages: the jargon of the theater; the Chinook jargon.

A VERNACULAR is the authentic "natural pattern" of speech, now usually on  
the informal level, used by persons indigenous to a certain community, large  
or small.

  
I don't even know if I'm supposed to say 'Saṃskṛta', without a doted m, but  
while I'm not dotting my m's, there's a beautiful rainbow to be gazed upon  
outside of my window.

  
Eddie
