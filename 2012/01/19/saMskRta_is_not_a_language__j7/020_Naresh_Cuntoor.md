Well, English has its grammar too. And etymology. And verbs. And prefixes. And suffixes. And thematic roles. And context-sensitive grammar. So by your reasoning, English is not *just* a language like any other human language in the world!

That Samskrit was a widely-spoken language is quite clear from Patanjali's preface to his commentary on Ashtadhyayi where he says "... keshAM shabdAnAm? laukikAnAM vaidikAnAM cha ..." (or something to that effect). Evidently, they did not use the label Samskrita back then. So what? After all Hindus did not use the label 'Hindu' for a long time!  
  
I think we tend to get carried away by the parsing ease of Sanskrit and ascribe all kinds of unnecessary superlatives. English has its parsing engines too. Otherwise, Microsoft Word would not highlight mistakes of disagreeing verbs and subjects. Or red-flag bad constructions. So does this make English different from a normal, natural, human language?

Please elaborate. What are these hints?

This is exactly what I mean by the use of terms within and outside of a shastra context. Bhartrhari uses the term sphoTa in his theory of language in certain specific ways. Here you have brought in Rishis and Yogis in deep meditation and all that. sphoTa in sphoTa-vAda is not that.  
  
Rishis may have had great insights because of their saadhana. They may have expressed their thoughts in Samskrit. That does not mean Samskrit itself is a divine revelation or whatever. Now if one were to claim that they came upon these great insights because they knew Samskrit, that would indeed be interesting -- iff one can substantiate that claim.
