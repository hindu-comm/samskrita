Samskrita is as much a language as English, and as much a jargon as English. For example, terms like energy, quarks, etc. have well-defined meaning in physics. For the layman, perhaps not as much. Similarly, when we look at terms like "supi cha" (as is being discussed in the other thread) - we are talking jargon.  
  
The notions of samadhi, nirvikalpa etc. have certain meaning in yogashastra. Whether one understands the concepts, or agrees with how well-defined it is, is besides the point. Outside of yogashastra, one might employ these terms without regard for precision - and that is fine as far as we understand that we are talking outside the confines of the shastra.  
  
Now for amusement, let us consider the four definitions quoted from Webster.  
  
1. Dhananjay and others have already pointed out the problem with this. "Same community or nation", "same cultural tradition", "same geographical area" are all rather limiting definitions which fail to capture why English is a language.  
  
Or, by this definition we have to agree to say that English is not a language. Ridiculous, that is.  
  
Alternatively, community, nation, culture, geographical area, have to defined broadly.  
  
Or we have to accept that English is not a language, but that Indian English, British English, American English are languages. Would that make New England English, Southern English, Midwestern English, etc. dialects? Fine, if it does!  
  
2. communication by voice, speech etc. -- I don't see how this definition disqualifies Samskrit from being a language. Care to elaborate? Or do you propose to redefine human?  
  
3. I don't understand how this is "opposed to speech".  
  
4. Again, I don't see how this definition disqualifies Samskrit from being a language. Please elaborate.
