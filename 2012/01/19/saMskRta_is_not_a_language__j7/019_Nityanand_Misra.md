I am probably the first person on the thread to agree with you, but only partly :).  
  
First where I agree with you. Sanskrit is not *just* a language like any other human language in the world. The formal structure which it has (a context sensitive grammar), codified by the nearly 4000 Sutras of Panini, along with the appendices on Dhatus and Ganas, et cetera, make it a context sensitive (or recursively enumerable) language which can be recognized by a Turing Machine. Sanskrit \[or a Sanskrit speaker\] knows that it is different from a normal, natural, human language - this is evidenced by two words used in Sanskrit for "human" languages -

1.  प्राकृत, this literally means "natural", but a special meaning of
    the word is any other naturally spoken language apart from
    Sanskrit.  
2.  भाषा, this word literally means "language", but a special meaning of
    the word is a Prakrit or natural language. That the term भाषा  

So in Sanskrit itself, there are hints to be found that all other human languages are natural/mortal/human/unrefined, while Sanskrit is not.  
  
Now where I differ. It is still a language in the sense of of all meanings in Webster, even though it may not be natural or mortal. Depending on your belief, you may call it an ideal language which was refined/designed/perfected over centuries (hence the name संस्कृत or संस्कृता वाक्), or you may call it a divine language which was revealed to some Rishis and Yogis in deep meditation (hence the names देवभाषा or गीर्वाणवाणी) as a स्फोट. It is very different from a natural human language, but still a language nevertheless. Finally, a jargon is restricted to a specific occupational community e.g. medical/computer/business jargon. But Sanskrit was used in texts of every occupation in India - be it philosophy, or medicine, or music, or metallurgy, or astronomy, or linguistics, or mathematics, or alchemy, or religion, or .... the list is endless.
