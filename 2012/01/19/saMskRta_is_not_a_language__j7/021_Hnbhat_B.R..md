All the arguments by Nithyanandaji are based on very often quoted maxims:

  

संस्कृतं नाम दैवी वाग् अन्वाख्याता महर्षिभिः।

  

(काव्यादर्श of दण्डिन्)

  

which presupposes the validity of the statement in Vedic literature(Rigveda(8.101):

  

देवीं वाचमजनयन्त देवास्तां विश्वरूपाः पशवो वदन्ति ।  
सा नो मन्द्रेषमूर्जं दुहाना धेनुर्वागस्मानुप सुष्टुतैतु ॥११॥

  

which is dependent on the word देव and makes the language as देवभाषा or गीर्वाणभाषा.

  

The interpretation of the above is Sanskrit is a divine language, unlike any human language. Only that it was refined by Panini and other महर्षि-s with their divine vision. Hope this makes clear Nityanandji's expression.

  

While from a neutral point, it can refer the faculty of speech in general, which is adapted by great grammarians according to their languages and the Vedic seer wishes this faculty always present which is a living force (without which one will be crippled with the speech faculty). The interpretations differ taking advantage of thepolysemous nature ofwords  in Sanskrit Language. Here "deva" can meanan organ of sense (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988) also. This is theory of creation is developed in the Yoga and Sankhya systems also who do not depend on a Creator for the creation. By the way, Dandin refers to Sanskrit language as the language as अन्व्याख्याता महर्षिभिः is quite obvious.

  

I just reported what I knew without taking any side in the discussion whether Sanskrit is divine or mortal or human language or language at all.
