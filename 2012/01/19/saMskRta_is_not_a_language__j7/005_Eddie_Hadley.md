Arvind & other adversaries,



“That apart, you have not explained why or how Sanskrit does not stand

this four-fold test. More discussion will be possible after you take a position”



I would prefer the more neutral phrase ‘my understanding’ to the more partisan sounding ‘my position’.



That said, I do but document the definitions as received.

The great word book itself, but faithfully records in enumerated fashion, the many and variable usages to which such a word is put,

but did not invent them, itself.



I justify my assertion, thusly:

But first, to *intelligibly* communicate, we must ensure to use the ‘same set of symbols’.

The symbol X, may indeed be commonly understood, amongst other things, as ‘one that marks the spot’.

However, that still leaves the small matter as to which ‘spot’ the X so marks, for there often be a number of such.

I therefore enumerate four such given symbols, complete with associated spots, duly described.

Such sets of symbols, at least when impartially provided, should be fairly comprehensive.

I justify my assertion, via the use of *italics:*

I quote the synonyms verbatim:

—Syn. 2. See speech. 4, 9. tongue; terminology; lingo, lingua franca.

LANGUAGE, DIALECT, JARGON, VERNACULAR refer to patterns of vocabulary, syntax, and usage characteristic of communities of various sizes and types.



LANGUAGE is applied to the *general pattern* of a people or race: the English language.



DIALECT is applied to *certain forms* or *varieties of* a language, often those that provincial communities or special groups retain (or develop) even after a standard has been established: Scottish dialect.



A JARGON is either an *artificial pattern* used by a particular (usually occupational) group within a community or a special pattern created for communication in business or trade between members of the groups speaking different languages: the jargon of the theater; the Chinook jargon.



A VERNACULAR is the authentic *natural pattern* of speech, now usually on the informal level, used by persons indigenous to a certain community, large or small.





So, *by definition* Saṃskṛta is not a 'language'!



Hopefully, my italicised items are self-explanatory.



Eddie
