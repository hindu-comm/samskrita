Hello All,

  

In response to Mr. Eddie's opinion that Samskrita is not a language.

  

Though I have my reservations about Webster's being the universal authority to decide what constitutes a language and what does not, Let us hypothetically assume the definitions used by Webster's to decide what is a language.

  

The letter Y represents cases where samskrita satisfies the definition and N where in my humble opinion, it doesn't.

I welcome comments and criticism from other experts.

Overall the score stands as 8 Ys against one Y/N and 3 Ns
