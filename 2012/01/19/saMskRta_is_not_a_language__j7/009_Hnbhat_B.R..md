Anyway I have nothing more to add by way of logic of Aristotle or the definition of language, which seems to be based on its etymology:

  

## Origin of*LANGUAGE*

Middle English, from Anglo-French*langage,*from*lange, langue*tongue, language, from Latin*lingua*— more at[tongue](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tongue)

First Known Use: 14th century

  

There is nothing to show that should be spoken/used at the present time. It can be referring to any system once used by any language community (either extinct or live). Here is the definition of Sanskrit from the same Webster's dictionary which defines Sanskrit as a language (of coursesaṁskṛta

as an adjective) discussed in the earlier thread)

## Definition of*SANSKRIT*

1

**:**an ancient Indo-Aryan language that is the classical language of India and of Hinduism

2

**:**classical Sanskrit together with the older Vedic and various later modifications of classical Sanskrit — see[indo-european languages table](http://www.merriam-webster.com/table/dict/indo-european_languages.htm)

—**Sanskrit***adjective*

—**San·skrit·ic***adjective*

—**San·skrit·ist***noun*

[SeeSanskritdefined for kids»](http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&va=Sanskrit)

## Origin of*SANSKRIT*

Sanskrit*saṁskṛta,*literally, perfected, from*sam*together +*karoti*he makes

First Known Use: 1696

  

  

And his reference to First known use should be referring to the word Sanskrit as used by Europeans after the knowledge of*saṁskṛta, which should have been much earlier in Indian languages.*
