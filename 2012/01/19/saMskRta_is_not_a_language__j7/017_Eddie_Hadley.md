Dr,



The subject heading has the term in quotes - 'language'.



Usually such quotes imply a special sense of the word so quoted, as some members have noticed.





Of course Saṃskṛta is a language!



But that is not the issue.

As duly provided in the post, the issue has a number of levels when read between the lines, as again some members have noticed.





The classifications of ‘language’ according to the great authority that is Webster, are clearly presented by Webster, and reproduced there in my posts, was to enable learned discussion.



A dash of humour is added, to spice up what another professor of the ancient verbal has described as the ‘dry bones of grammar’.



By the given classification of ‘language’, Saṃskṛta is so classified:



 Saṃskṛta is

 not ‘general’

 not ‘DIALECT

  not “natural”

 IS “artificial”



The distinctions ~~lay~~ lie with the attributes of 'language'.

  
  
LANGUAGE "general"  
DIALECT "form of"  
JARGON "artificial"  
VERNACULAR "natural"  
  
As an exercise, one may entertain oneself by positioning "Saṃskṛta" in one  
or more, or even none of these places.  
Then try Yiddish, French, or what you will . . .  
  



the other level(s), which are also quite relevant:





Logic, by way of Aristotle et al, is the basic of the Law in many a Land.



It is relevant here, as the ‘the whole’ bit of this issue appears to have been overlooked by many.



Maybe I am mistaken in my assumptions that members of this particular grammar group would be well acquainted in the subtleties of language.



Hereby some criticism, which I am surprised to find, I need to bring to the forefront, from between those lines.



To be taken constructively, three times a day, during one’s coffee break, between the dusting down of manuscripts:



One man’s ‘language’ is another man’s ‘jargon’.



The onus is on the ‘jargon’ speaker to converse with non-jargon speakers in ’natural’ speak i.e. non jargon speak.



Please, at least when replying to lay members, which surely make up the vast majority, realise that explanations of the ‘jargon’ kind serve only to demonstrate the credentials of the demonstrator to fellow jargon speakers.

They ‘explanations’ simply obscure, not reveal.

To put it in the vernacular, they are quite meaningless, the do the very opposite to what is required.

Again in the vernacular, to explain is to to make plain or clear; render *understandable or intelligible*:



Thank you for you indulgence.



Eddie
