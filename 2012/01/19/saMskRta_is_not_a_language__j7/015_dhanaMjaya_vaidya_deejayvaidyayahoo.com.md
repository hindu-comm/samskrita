Webster (1913) gives a definition of Sanskrit as follows:  
  
(QUOTED)  
The ancient language of the Hindoos, long since obsolete in vernacular  
use, but preserved to the present day as the literary and sacred  
dialect of India. It is nearly allied to the Persian, and to the  
principal languages of Europe, classical and modern, and by its more  
perfect preservation of the roots and forms of the primitive language  
from which they are all descended, is a most important assistance in  
determining their history and relations.  
(ENDQUOTE)  
  
The words "language", "dialect" and "vernacular" are used but the term  
"jargon" is not used.  
"ancient language"  
"obsolete in vernacular"  
"literary and sacred dialect"  
  
Because this is a Webster's definition, it could be cross-referenced  
with their definitions of language, dialect and vernacular:  

  
\> LANGUAGE is applied to the "general pattern" of a people or race  

Webster (1913) states that Sanskrit is the ancient general pattern of  
of the people or race of Hindoos  

  
\> DIALECT is applied to "certain forms" or "varieties of" a language, often  
\> those that provincial communities or special groups retain (or develop) even  
\> after a standard has been established:  

Webster (1913) states that Sanskrit is a special literary and sacred  
form of a language, and these varieties have been retained or  
developed even after a standard was established.  
  
\>A JARGON  
(not mentioned in the definition of "sanskrit")  

  
\>A VERNACULAR is the authentic "natural pattern" of speech, now usually on  
\>the informal level, used by persons indigenous to a certain community, large  

\>or small. :  
Webster (1913) states that Sanskrit is now obsolete as a natural  
pattern of speech on an informal level in persons indigenous to any  
community  
  
Hope this may be helpful.  
  
No rainbow outside my window this minute, but a rather pretty, if non-  
supernatural, sunrise.
