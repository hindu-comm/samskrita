Eddie,  
  
I am not comfortable with Condition No 1. 'The same geographical  
area' could have relevance in the primitive days when languages were  
being created or lost. I believe we have now reached a stage of  
stability of the existing set of languages and many of them reach far  
beyond their original geographical confines without losing their  
'languageness'.  
  
That apart, you have not explained why or how Sanskrit does not stand  
this four-fold test. More discussion will be possible after you take  
a position.
