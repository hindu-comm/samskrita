Eddie,  
  
I do not want to trivialize what you are trying to convey but it is  
going over our - or let me say my - head.  
  
I suspect that deciding whether a particular way of expression is a  
language or not should not require so much learned debate. If it does,  
it is a sure sign that we are discussing a non-issue.  
  
In such situations why not apply the famous - and usually unfailing -  
'duck test'? If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks  
like a duck, then it probably is a duck.  
  
(Whether we write the word as ' 'Saṃskṛta' or as 'Sanskrit' or in any  
other way is really not the test of its languageness at all. That is  
a spin-off of the irrelevant fact that the Roman script has 26 letters  
and cannot represent all sounds correctly to pronounce the word  
संस्कृत. None in Canada can really pronounce my last name as it  
should be pronounced but that does not render me a non-person.)
