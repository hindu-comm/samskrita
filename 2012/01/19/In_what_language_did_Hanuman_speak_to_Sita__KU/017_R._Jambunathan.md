Respected members,

"Dear Friends ,

Just for your information. Dr. Bhave was a Doctor teaching in  
Government Medical College . He was also an avid pilot . He used to  
teach as visiting faculty at KEM hospital . He used to come by  
helicopter to teach . He undertook to research the Ramayana and the  
various places given in Ramayana . He traveled via air from Ayodhya to  
Sri Lanka noting down the places from Ramayana and mapping these on  
aerial map . He has written a book on this topic . Not only was he  
able to find almost all places mentioned in Ramayana but he also  
calculated timeline ( time taken to move from one place to another )  
mentioned in Ramayana and matched it agaist the distances and has come  
out with a good match . One fact he mentions alongwith photoes is that  
some of descriptions of places given in Ramayana are only possible if  
these places were seen from high up in the air .

Regards ,

Anand Ghurye "

While I am in full agreement with Sri Nityanand Misraji, is it  
reasonable to expect the places described in Ramayana to be present  
today as described therein, in as much as Sri rAma avatAra was in  
treta yuga and now we are in kali yuga with dwApara yuga ( \~864000  
years intervening).

Regards,

Jambunathan
