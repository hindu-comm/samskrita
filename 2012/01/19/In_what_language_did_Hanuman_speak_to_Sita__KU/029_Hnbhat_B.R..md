There is no need of such an preamble for this belief as it is already available in the following verse attributed to अगस्त्यसंहिता-

  

वेदवेद्येपरे पुंसि जाते दशरथात्मजे । वेदः प्राचेतसाऽदासीत् साक्षाद् रामायणात्मना ।। तस्माद्रामायणं देवि! वेद एव न संशयः ।। \[Agastya-SamhitA\].

  

One can find many more on googling from similar blog spots.
