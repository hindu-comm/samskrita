Dear Friends,  
  
Wiht reference to Anand Ghurye's mail above, for those wanting to know  
more about Dr Bhave's aerial photography and retracing Rama's and the  
cloud-messenger's routes, these two new reports from ToI will be  
informative:  
  
<http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-10-26/pune/27239773_1_mr-bhave-sri-lanka-pushpak>  
<http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-12-27/pune/27219521_1_bhave-pushpak-ram>  
  
Dr Bhave expired just two month's after his book came out in print.  
He was an amateur aviator who maintained a small airplane as a hobby.  
  
Claims of science and technology made on behalf ancient India were the  
subject of a long discussion in the Group in November 2010 under the  
heading 'Science And Technology In Vedas And Sastras' and may be seen  
at <http://tinyurl.com/6n67p6b>. Several members of the Group.  
including this humble scribe, contributed to it. As suggested by  
श्रीमल्ललितालालितः, the discussion about science and technology may  
perhaps be continued under that thread, leaving this thread only for  
the topic of HanumAn's language while addressing SItA.
