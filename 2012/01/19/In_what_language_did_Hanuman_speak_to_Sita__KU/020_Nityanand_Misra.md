Firstly, your stated reason is not reason but an assumption or your belief. In the Indian tradition, Ramayana and Mahabharata are called इतिहास - इति ह आस - thus definitely happened. If I use this fact (that it is called इतिहास) and call it my "reason" conclude that the events actually happened - that is not reasoning at all.  
  
Secondly, अनुमान as defined by पतञ्जलि in Yoga Sutra is not "doubt" but "inference" or "reasoning". An example is to conclude the existence of fire from existence of smoke, or the existence of father from existence of son.
