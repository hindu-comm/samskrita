I am not sure if discussions of "whether it really happened" is of any benefit at all. All said and done, it comes to one basic point - "What I believe in" is confused as "What happened". The strong identification of oneself to what one believes in, clouds any reasoning of what happened.

  

It is not that the objectivity is lost. But objectivity in itself is mis-believed to be "conclusive reasoning".

  

We can't even believe how we lived without cellphones a few years ago. A person from future generation may never believe a world without cellphone, iphone or a tablet. But that doesnt mean that such a world didnt exist.

  

There are so many great things in Ramayana. I hope the learned ones here can educate others on that.
