All the opinions calling Pushpak Viman as poetic imaginations are themselves imaginations masquerading as rational logic. When one cannot prove or disprove something, the right conclusion is no conclusion. Lack of proof does not imply lack of existence, it is the other way round - proof implies existence. Elementary logic says if A => B then negation of B => negation of A. Elementary logic also says that if A => B then negation of A need not imply negation of B. Take A=proof and B=existence and you may understand what I am hinting, if your logic is indeed sound.  
  
Indian thought system accepts three proofs (प्रमाण or means of true knowledge) as specified in the Yoga Sutra  
  
प्रत्यक्षानुमानागमाः प्रमाणानि (Samadhi Pada 7)  
  
Regarding events in Ramayana, प्रत्यक्ष प्रमाण can be available only to characters of Ramayana and to Valmiki, Vyas, Tulsidas et cetera. When you try अनुमान, which is the only means people in this group resorted to, nothing can be proved or disproved. आगम is the third option which is trusting Vedas, scriptures or a siddha/saint. MaCaulay's greatgrandchildren and eminent historians can resort to incorrect अनुमान to call them myth makers, but for believers like me, Valmiki, Vyas and Tulsidas were not people who would lie, and so for me, their speech is a proof by means of आगम. When Tulsidas said that नौमीड्यं जानकीशं रघुवरमनिशं पुष्पकारूढरामम् meaning he bowed down many a time to Rama aboard Pushpak Viman, it is my strong belief that neither was he hallucinating nor was he weaving myths - he was perceiving the actual events.  
  
McCaulay's greatgrandchildren and eminent historians can believe in what they want, but if you want to use correct logic or rational thinking (अनुमान), then in the absence of any proof, your conclusion is the same as your null hypothesis. My null hypothesis is different from yours, nothing else.
