"Wrong. Because fiction is based on reality, whatever is based on fiction is also real for the most part. Imagination can propose a five-legged man-eating monster in Venus. While the idea may seem preposterous, 'legs' are real things, 'Venus' is real, 'man' is real, and so is 'monster.' Their confluence is unlikely. "  

  

These are some possible definition of fiction  

**a.** An imaginative creation or a pretense that does not represent actuality but has been invented.

**b.** The act of inventing such a creation or pretense.

**2.** A lie.

**3.**

**a.** A literary work whose content is produced by the imagination and is not necessarily based on fact.

**b.** The category of literature comprising works of this kind, including novels and short stories.

**4.** *Law* Something untrue that is intentionally represented as true by the narrator.  
  
I feel the Ramayana of Valmniki is perfect match

"Your application introduces a new word 'story' which does not find place in your reason, or relate to it. Do not apply what is not reasoned. If you want to relate story and fiction, be my guest.

"There is no doubt in my mind that Rama is a manifestation of Brahman. Valmiki composed a poem. That poem itself was never apologetic in its various descriptions of Rama, which are understood to be the lakshanas of Brahma tattva. Those who understand it from such perspective would not be apologetic about the same, nor seek to justify it in any manner to one who is not on the same playing field. "  
  
"Rama is a manifestation of Visnnu. Not Brahma definitely not Brahman used in the Neuter ( If that is true everyone is a manifestation of Brahmhan including Rama and Ravana)"  
Valmiki composed a poem I agree  
That poem itself was never apologetic in its various descriptions of Rama, which are understood to be the lakshanas of Brahma tattva.The poem did not want to Promote any Bramha tattva it wanted portray the art of ideal living which may or may not be Bramha tattva. Please define Bramha tattva  
  

"Those who understand it from such perspective would not be apologetic about the same, nor seek to justify it in any manner to one who is not on the same playing field. "  
  

Valmiki doesn't impose his view point assuming that he is the author of the all the numerous recension and variation of Ramayana story that we have as of now.
