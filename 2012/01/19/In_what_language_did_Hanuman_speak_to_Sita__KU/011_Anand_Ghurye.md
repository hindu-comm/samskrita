Dear Friends ,  
  
Just for your information. Dr. Bhave was a Doctor teaching in Government Medical College . He was also an avid pilot . He used to teach as visiting faculty at KEM hospital . He used to come by helicopter to teach . He undertook to research the Ramayana and the various places given in Ramayana . He traveled via air from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka noting down the places from Ramayana and mapping these on aerial map . He has written a book on this topic . Not only was he able to find almost all places mentioned in Ramayana but he also calculated timeline ( time taken to move from one place to another ) mentioned in Ramayana and matched it agaist the distances and has come out with a good match . One fact he mentions alongwith photoes is that some of descriptions of
places given in Ramayana are only possible if these places were seen from high up in the air .
