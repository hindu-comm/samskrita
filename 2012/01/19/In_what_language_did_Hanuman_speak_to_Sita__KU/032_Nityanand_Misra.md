For the record, both Ramayana and Mahabharata are considered Itihasa. Ramayana is considered as both आदिकाव्य and इतिहास, and its consideration as इतिहास dates back to Mammata's Kavyaprakash. The terms आदिकाव्य and इतिहास are not contradictory. See the entry of Itihasa in the following work.

That also does not mean epic has to be false. Iliad and Aenind were considered to be a legends with no historical basis but Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of the lost city of Troy reopened the debate/
