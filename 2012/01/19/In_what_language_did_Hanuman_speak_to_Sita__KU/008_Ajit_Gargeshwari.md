Dear Muthy  
I would go by option c  
  
So logically its a pure story to enjoy  
  
To quote Arivind's words " This story, which essentially

  
is a human story, caught the imagination of poets whose embellishments  
of it further caught the imagination of a population "  
  

It a pure fiction combined with excellent imagination and it forms a great poem  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
