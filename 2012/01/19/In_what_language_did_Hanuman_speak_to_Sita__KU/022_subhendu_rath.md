I was also in doubt whether Ramyana is a real History or an excellent Poem or a real History with some fiction (To add flavor to the history).  
Everything changed when I came across Bonda tribal people in Malkangiri district in South orissa. Theses people are still quite uncivilized and do not mix with common or so called civilized people. Due to Hilly deep Forest region with Naxal problem It is still not possible to access them completely. A group from bonda people who live in the lower part of hill were lately accessed.  
Uniqueness of bonda Tribal women is that they do not wear any dress upon them (although ever other tribal in other parts of orissa state were wearing dress even before British period). Only leaf are adorned over private organs. WHY?  
What the down the Hill tribal people say is that  
" **A long time back a queen like women Sita along with his husband was stying near Saleru-Godavari river . Once she was bathing in the river naked. Few Bonda women passing near by laughed by looking towards Sita in that state. So Devi Sita thinking that these may be MAYAVI demons in veil of women, cursed them that they will never wear any cloth upon them. Otherwise they and their family will suffer. Then those tribal women requested devi Sita to take back her curse and pardon them. After knowing about their reality Devi Sita said that the curse once given can not be taken back. So they may wear leaf or any other thing to protect their private part, but not cloth**."  
  
So after listening all these from those tribal I astonished and change my thinking about reality of Ramayan. Even many of their customs carry the names of Rama, Sita and Laxaman although they were completely cut off for many centuries from outside world.  
So they are not wearing any dress evening during extreme winter season.  
Many Indian and Foreign sociologist have made research on Bonda people and found the above fact true. you may search into Google to find many more facts to prove Ramayan among many isolated Tribal society in Orissa, Madhy Pradesh, Chhhatisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Maharastra region.
