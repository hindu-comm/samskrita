Namo namaH,

  

Sri Ajit-ji, are you not stereo-typing and over-generalising when you say Indians are good (meaning all Indians in general) at myth making?

  

You say (and I quote you here):

  

"If one looks at the sky one sees stars. So how how doI reach stars I fly. This is just pure common sense logic which our ancients were good at."  

  

If such be the only logic and common-sense that was available, did you find any statements in ancient writings sages or rishis flying and
reaching ashwini or magha or anuradha nakshatras? 

  

There is no point in speculating about the common sense or logic of our ancients when we have next to nothing information on that sphere.

  

Regards,

  

narayan

Myth making is an ancient art Indians are good at and trying to find scientific explanations without any basis we are equally good at this is a classic example.  
  
There is always a vast difference between facts and imagination.
