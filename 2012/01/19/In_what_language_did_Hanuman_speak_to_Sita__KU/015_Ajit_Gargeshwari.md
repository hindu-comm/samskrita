In reply to Nityanandji post  
  
Proposition: Ramayana is a figment of a poets imagination  
Reason: Because it is based on fiction  
Example: Whatever is based on fiction is a imagination (as a story) (homogeneous or affirmative)  
Application :so is Ramaraya a Story - (affirmative)  
Conclusion Therefore Ramayana is a fiction  
  

"Valmiki, Vyas and Tulsidas were not people who would lie, and so for me, their speech is a proof by means of आगम. "  

Ramayana is neither a Veda or an Agama so whatever Valmiki, Vyas and Tulsidas doesn't matter  
  
Anumana is doubt in common langauge usage and it will always remain as a doubt Pushpak Viman, in my view the poet was hallucinating or was he weaving myths - he was didn't see any events except to make a good story and a grand Epic.
