Dear Anand Ghurye  
Ramyana is said to have taken place Treta yuga and now we are in Kali yuga seperated by millions of year as per puranans. When this is fact Dr. Bhave research is for amusement and serves no purpose.  
  
To find rationality in myths and superstitions or personal belief will never work for a person who wants to see sober facts  
  
As has been already pointed out by Dr. Bhat one can only speculate as Valmiki doesnot say Hanuman, Sita or Ravana spoke different languages  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
