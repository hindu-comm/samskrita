Dear Group,

This my two-paise worth of opinion.

Before attempting an answer to this question, the person attempting  
the answer has to choose between three mutually exclusive  
alternatives, as below:

A\) Does the Ramayana, wholly or at least substantially, a chronicle of  
events and personalities that actually happened?  
B) Does the Ramayana represent a kernel of a true story of a much  
smaller scale, which was embroidered upon and expanded upon by a poet  
called Valmiki?  
C) Is it a pure fiction of imagination?

(The poet 'Valmilki' could be one poet or it could be a collective  
name for a group of poets but discussing that would lead us away from  
the main issue at hand.)

Further attempts to answer the question can be meaningful only if one  
selects Option A. Then you go into questions like whether the  
language was संस्कृता वाक्, if yes, what is the purport of the word  
'संस्कृता', or, alternatively as observed by the commentator quoted by  
Dr Bhat, 'अत्र वाक्यस्य मानुषत्वं कोसलदेशवर्तिमनुष्यसंबन्धित्वं  
विवक्षितम्' or any other alternative

For those selecting options B or C, the question is irrelevant. If  
Ramayana is substantially or wholly an imaginary tale, play of  
imagination alone is enough reason to explain anything said therein.

That said, I do not wish to step back without attempting any answer to  
the question.

I go for option B. I think that accepting the story exactly as  
narrated puts too much strain on physical boundaries within which the  
world runs today and obviously ran 3000 or 4000 years ago. That world  
cannot have bridges built across the sea with stones that float  
because the word 'Rama' is written on them. That world also cannot  
have monkeys speaking with human voice, in Sanskrit or any other  
language. It cannot have a Viman that flies or a King Dasharatha  
whose help the Gods had to seek in their war. At the same time I  
would not like to go so far as to say the story is an entire fiction  
as it does have echoes of actual events like the spread of the culture  
from the North towards the South. I think that Ramayana was a  
chronicle of events that took place on a smaller scale both as regards  
the geographical extent and the capabilities of its various  
characters. A young prince avenged, with the help of tribes, a  
dishonor done to him by a mighty king. This story, which essentially  
is a human story, caught the imagination of poets whose embellishments  
of it further caught the imagination of a population that was much  
less skeptical and more credulous than today's population.

As I have selected Option B, I answer the question by saying that only

  
Valmiki knew what he meant when he wrote:

यदि वाचं प्रदास्यामि द्विजातिरिव संस्कृताम् \|  

रावणं मन्यमाना सा सीता भीता भविष्यति \|  

वानरस्य विशॆषेण कथं स्यादभिभाषणम् \|  

अवश्यमेव वक्तव्यं मानुष्यं वाक्यमर्थवत् \|\|
