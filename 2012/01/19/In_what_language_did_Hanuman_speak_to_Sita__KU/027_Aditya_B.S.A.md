नमो नमः

नमो नमः

  

I much resisted the impulse to jump into this thread at the outset, and thought I shouldobserve where it would go. But between the apologists, the rationalists, and the cynics, I believe the 'layers' have only been added to, creating a confounding medley that is quite pointless.

  

\<A) Does the Ramayana, wholly or at least substantially, a chronicle of

events and personalities that actually happened?  
B) Does the Ramayana represent a kernel of a true story of a much  
smaller scale, which was embroidered upon and expanded upon by a poet  
called Valmiki?  
C) Is it a pure fiction of imagination?>

  

Let me point out the assumptions made here. In case of point A:

  

1\. That the Ramayana is a chronicle written by a chronicler.

The Ramayana never claimed to be an accurate chronicle in the first place, in the manner that we know chronicles. Anyone who has *actually* read it won't be bothered with having to agree to this point, purely because it suggests a notion that is void from the start.

  

2\. That the Ramayana represents a 'kernel' of a true story that was embellished by Valmiki.This is the most presumptuous point because it assumes that the intent of the poet was to embellish a true story.Are we so hypocritical as to try to pinpoint sources of inspiration for a poet, with the confident assumption that they were real-life incidents, when we struggle to establish real incidents of our own time with due process?Firstly, state your yardstick for establishing 'truth.' And also, if you believe Valmiki's main intent was to compose a poem (and one of the best ever), don't do him the injustice of limiting the scope of his inspiration to your assumed reality.

  

3. And of course, if it was all a figment of Valmiki's imagination, as is suggested in the third point, at least one is saved from having to conjecture about poetic inspiration. One is content to remain a frog in the well, which is their comfortable notion of real and unreal.

  

The following logic is absolutely inconsistent:

  

Proposition: Ramayana is a figment of a poets imagination.  
Reason: Because it is based on fiction.

If imagination is based on fiction, what is fiction based on? Fiction is based on reality. If fiction is based on reality, when does it become fiction? When a part of the fictional account does not concur with your understanding of reality. So your part-fiction can be my full-fact, because my understanding of reality (which is the base of fiction) ensures that I am steadfast in my view that your fiction is, in fact, reality.

  

Example: Whatever is based on fiction is a imagination (as a story) (homogeneous or affirmative)

  

Wrong. Because fiction is based on reality, whatever is based on fiction is also real for the most part. Imagination can propose a five-legged man-eating monster in Venus. While the idea may seem preposterous, 'legs' are real things, 'Venus' is real, 'man' is real, and so is 'monster.' Their confluence is unlikely.

  

Application :so is Ramaraya a Story - (affirmative)

Conclusion Therefore Ramayana is a fiction

  

Your application introduces a new word 'story' which does not find place in your reason, or relate to it. Do not apply what is not reasoned. If you want to relate story and fiction, be my guest. But I am sure I can point out your flaws there, too.Your conclusion, based on a flawed reason and flawed application, is also flawed.

  

There is no doubt in my mind that Raama is a manifestation of Brahman. Valmiki composed a poem. That poem itself was never apologetic in its various descriptions of Rama, which are understood to be the lakshanas of Brahma tattva. Those who understand it from such perspective would not be apologetic about the same, nor seek to justify it in any manner to one who is not on the same playing field.
