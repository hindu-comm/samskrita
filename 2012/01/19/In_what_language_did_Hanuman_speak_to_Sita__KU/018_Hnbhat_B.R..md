Just addendum>

  

  

Even accepting computers came as an invention by copying the Panini's system or Pingala's binary system, for the sake of argument there were in Panini's and Pingala's time binary system was present, (this not my opinion, but the opinion of some of the topics I have read in this group and other groups), the immediate question will be how it was lost? Only after the invention of computers we are aware that the science had developed in our ancestry and was lost to negligence of our ancestors or the attack of foreigners, they were carried off from us? (and published as their patent right)? Right brothers copied aeronotics from Veda-s or Ramayana probably, only to remind of our ancestry and research to be taken by Arvind Gurye to identify the places present in Kritayug?

  

I can add cellphones were in the time of Ramayana also, so that Hanuman could talk to Bharata, while he was about to enter fire on the day Rama had promised to return.

  

From my little knowledge of Sanskrit literature, Ramayana was not considered as the इतिहास which is usually associated with महाभारत in contrast with वाल्मीकि's रामायण as आदिकाव्य in the very outset of Indian Literary persons honoring him as आदिकवि.

  

I think rather than enjoying the poem as enjoyed by our ancestors, we are using the discussions to convince other we believe or do not believe than any thing with literature and enjoy ourselves.

  

Art for Art's sake is seemingly western concept, but it was present in India also since Bhamaha's time.

  

धर्मार्थकाममोक्षेषु वैचक्षण्यं कलासु च ।

करोति कीर्तिं प्रीतिञ्चसाधुकाव्यनिषेवणम्॥

  

and whether भक्ति is to be given a status of रस was yet open till the advent of भक्तिप्रस्थान in poetry. Only the reverse of the purpose or emphasis on one of the benefits over others is done in many of the discussions.
