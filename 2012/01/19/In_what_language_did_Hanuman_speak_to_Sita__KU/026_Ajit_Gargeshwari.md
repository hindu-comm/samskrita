Mahabharata is called इतिहास. Ramayana is said to be an Adikavya and not इतिहास.  
I agree several researches are being done to prove the historicity of Ramayayna but none of the researches provide any concluding evidence because Ramayana was written in Treata yuga as per the epic narration and as per historical facts, forget Rama not even dinosaurs existed during those early times. This is to speak of the historic sense of the epic.  
  
Ramayana has been written and re written several times. There are several versions and variants of Ramyana. This shows that myth makers and story writers from time immemorial have tampered with the text.  
Ramayana has a strong influence of Sanskrit Kavya, Drama, and religious literature there is no doubt absolutely.  
  
An epic may have an influence this doesn't mean an epic has to be true  
Let us keep अनुमान as defined by पतञ्जलि in Yoga Sutra Advaitins view Buddihsts view on the same to a different thread  
This is all i have to say thank you
