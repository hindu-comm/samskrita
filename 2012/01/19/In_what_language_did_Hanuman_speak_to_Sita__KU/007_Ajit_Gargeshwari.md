Myth making is an ancient art Indians are good at and trying to find scientific explanations without any basis we are equally good at this is a classic example.  
  
There is always a vast difference between facts and imagination. If onelooksat the sky one sees stars. So how how doI reach stars I fly. This is just pure common sense logic which our ancients were good at. That doesn't mean we had the technology to fly to stars  
  
Pushpak Vimana mentioned in Ramayana is a poetic imagination and there is nothing more to it.
