Even accepting computers came as an invention by copying the Panini's system or Pingala's binary system, for the sake of argument there were in Panini's and Pingala's time binary system was present, (this not my opinion, but the opinion of some of the topics I have read in this group and other groups), the immediate question will be how it was lost?  
  

In my opinion this assumption is not correct. Yes Panini's system of Grammar is highly sytematic and scientific in terms of sutras its arrangement etc. This doesnot mean Panin new Binary System or was even remotely hinting at 21st century Mathematical concepts

  
  
"Only after the invention of computers we are aware that the science had developed in our ancestry and was lost to negligence of our ancestors or the attack of foreigners, they were carried off from us? (and published as their patent right)?  

Science was well developed in India and we were much ahead of times in early historical period. Scientific spirit and growth was curtailed to a large extent due to political instability"

  
  
"Right brothers copied aeronotics from Veda-s or Ramayana probably, only to remind of our ancestry and research to be taken by Arvind Gurye to identify the places present in Kritayug? "  
  

Wright brothers didn't copy aeronautics from Vedas or any of our epics. If one starts thinking in this highly unscientific manner I am sure a day may not be far away when we shall stop all scientific and engineering research and can start looking at non existing theories in our ancient scriptures. Let us save ourselves from going back to middle ages. I don't think reinterpreting and re understanding ancient texts mean imposing foreign ideas into these texts which the neither these texts speak of nor the author of these texts were aware.  
  
If any still feels Wright brothers copied " aeronautics from Vedas" please provide proof so that the scientific community may accept such findings and true spirit of inquiry call for such acceptance.  
  
For the sake of acceptance let me accept an ancient bridge was built between India and lanka that might have been possible but doesn't make the story of Ramayana a historical.  
  
In my opinion one should study Ramayana to enjoy the superb and unparalleled which talks and glorifies highest Human sentiments, values.
