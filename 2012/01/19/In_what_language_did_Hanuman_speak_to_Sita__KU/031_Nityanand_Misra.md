Coming back to the original question, Jagadguru Ramandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya expounded on these verses from the VR in one of his discourses on the Ramayana given in Muradabad, Uttar Pradesh on September 13, 2009. He cited a Sanskrit commentary (unnamed, maybe Tilak or Bhushan Tika, but I am not sure) which says the languages was either Awadhi or Maithili. His conclusion is that the language was Awadhi.
