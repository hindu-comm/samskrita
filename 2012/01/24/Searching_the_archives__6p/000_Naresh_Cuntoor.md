Dear list members,  
  
Please remember that you can search the archives for both Devanagari (unicode) text and English by going to  
<https://groups.google.com/group/samskrita>  
Type your query text in the box on top and click on "Search this group".  
  
For example, I tried this query -  
  
यस्याश्चोर  
  
and obtained the discussion on Feb 12, 2011.  
  
Of course, the search engine does not do any sandhi parsing or such, so you may have to be a little creative in searching for shlokas.  
  
  
Thanks,  
Naresh
