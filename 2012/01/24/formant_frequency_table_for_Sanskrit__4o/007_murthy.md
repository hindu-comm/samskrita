Dear Misraji,

This ia asan amplification of my previous post. It is not necessary to count manually.If you want to count "Ru", you utilize the facilty, "Find and Replace". Replace "Ru" by say "X" throughout the file and this feature faithfully replaces "Ru" by "X" and in addition tells the number of replacements and voila, you have the count of "Ru"!

Regards,
