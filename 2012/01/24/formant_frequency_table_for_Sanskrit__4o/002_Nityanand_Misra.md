While I do not know of such a table, constructing one should be easy with any one of the works available online at, for example, the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit.  
  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/>  
  
If I were to do this, I would start with a prose work like *Daśakumāracaritam* rather than a poetic work*.* The reason is that the constraints of prosody may bias the frequency of long and short syllables and in some cases also the consonants. For example if you choose a work like Meghadūta or Bhṛṅgadūta which is entirely composed in the Mandākrāntā, you would get 10 long syllables for every 7 short syllables which may be undesirable.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
