For those interested, these are two relevant document that Ajit refers.



One relating to Classical texts and the other to Vedic.





However, both of the documents relate the research was carried out in the early days for a different purpose. To standardise a system of Romanization in the early days of Unicode.



The tables would need to be used in reverse, but I confirm that such tables are valid for such usage, simply because I have tried to use them so.



That said, here are the details of these docs.



The author is Ulrich Stiehl.



His works were instrumental to the development of Itranslator 2003.



I am familiar with these documents through my work as a beta tester for Itranslator 2003 v 2.5.0.0.





The Classical document with statistical table:
<http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf>



The Equivalent for Vedic:
<http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/tbsvaras.pdf>





Please, before you look at the Vedic document, be aware it contains the rather nasty racial comment viz.



‘Indian Niggers’



And realize that they are NOT those of the Author who is expressing his disagreement. And they certainty NOT part of my vocabulary.

namaste,



I would start by contacting the author of this page:



<http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/#CONJUNCTS>  

<http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/tbsvaras.pdf>



I have definitely seen a frequency table on this website in the past (IIRC, it was based on the mahabharata). I am not able to find it at the moment.



sasneham,



 ajit
