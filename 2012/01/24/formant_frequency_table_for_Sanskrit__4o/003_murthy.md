It would be possible to get the phoneme-frequency structure by copy-pasting a passage in its transliterated form on to Word and obataining the number of occurrences. For example if one wants to find out how often ऋ occurs, all that is required is that we find out how often "Ru" occurs in Baraha transliterated Sanskrit text. I believe using Unicode representation may not be useful for this exercise.
