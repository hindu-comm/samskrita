namaste,

  

I would start by contacting the author of this page:

  

<http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/#CONJUNCTS>  

<http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/tbsvaras.pdf>

  

I have definitely seen a frequency table on this website in the past (IIRC, it was based on the mahabharata). I am not able to find it at the moment.

  

sasneham,



 ajit
