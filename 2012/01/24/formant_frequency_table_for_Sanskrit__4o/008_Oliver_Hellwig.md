An addition to the discussion about frequency of speech formants  
(although I don't know whether this really answers the initial  
question):  
You find a dataset of all syllables in the DCS at  
<http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/data/syllables/syllables.htm>  
(syllables.dat, link at the bottom of the page)  
  
Vowels should be easy to extract from the data.  
  
The top part of the page displays the proportions of consonant types  
in the different historical layers of the corpus (retroflexes are not  
surprising, but gutturals are). The R code used to produce the plot is  
also linked at the bottom of the page.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Best, Oliver
