Bhashavritti by Purushottamadeva is a lucid commentary on Panini's  
Grammer, and the manuscript I am looking for is a commentary to  
Bhashavritti its name is Bhashavrittyarthavivrti by Sristidhara .More  
information can be obtained  
from Dictonary of Sanskrit Grammer.  
There is another commentary called Vivaranapancika published(only 4  
adhyayas) by Mithila Research institute in 2001  
also a German scholar edited the first adhyaya probably for his  
thesis.
