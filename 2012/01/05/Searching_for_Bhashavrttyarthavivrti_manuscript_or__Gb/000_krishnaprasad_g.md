Namaskarams  
  
I am searching for a work called Bhashavrttyarthavivrti by Sristidhara  
which is a commentary on Bhashavrtti written by Purushottamadeva  
either in the form of manuscript or published books (if any), in the book  
published by Rajasahi college in 1918 gives the information about the  
manuscripts were available in Rajasahi college Bangladesh, before  
searching I just thought to put here so that by chance if any one have  
come across the same will help me to get the manuscript with less burden.  
  
Thanking you.
