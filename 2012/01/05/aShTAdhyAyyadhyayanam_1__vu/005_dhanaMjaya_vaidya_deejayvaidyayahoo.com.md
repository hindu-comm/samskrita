I am very impressed with Shri Abhyankar starting self-study of the  
aShTAdhyAyI. This sort of free enquiry - trying to consider whether it  
should be the singular or the plural of "guNavRddhI" - shows a fresh  
mind and unbounded curiosity. I wish him the best of luck and  
success.

Please do not think me arrogant in suggesting that Shri Abhyankar  
should take the first few steps with the help of a teacher. Of course  
it is possible to understand the aShTAdhyAyI with self study. But I  
fear that the process is like trying to reinvent the wheel. Within a  
few steps, Shri Abhyankar will be able to grasp pANini's method. After  
that curiosity and free questioning will lead to new understanding and  
discovery. He can then dispense with the aid of the teacher of basics.

With sincere admiration and good wishes:  
Dhananjay
