I think you have understood everything else. Otherwise, this explanation will not meaning any thin

g\. A अधिकार is indicated by the use of accentuation स्वरित, as per the सूत्र -सूत्रम्॥स्वरितेनाधिकारः॥[१।३।११](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/1.3.11)॥

  

It is explained in the text itself, in 1.3.11. It is not an अधिकार-सूत्र, as the गुणवृद्धी is not accented with स्वरित as required by the above rule:

  

स्वरितेन इति इत्थम् भूतलक्षणे तृतीया। स्वरितो नाम स्वरविशेषो वर्णधर्मः। तेन चिह्णेन अधिकारो विदितव्यः। अधिकारो विनियोगः। स्वरितगुणयुक्तं शब्दरूपम् अधिकृतत्वादुत्तरत्र उपतिष्ठते। प्रतिज्ञास्वरिताः पाणिनीयाः।

  

And it is not a विधि prescribing गुण and वृद्धि as they are prescribed by other सूत्र-s and not with this one. Hence it is परिभाषा which is defined as अनियमे नियमकारिणी परिभाषा. = unless otherwise the target (स्थानिन्) is not prescribed, this type of rule acts as the specifying the context in the relevant सूत्र. This has been elaborately explained in the present सूत्र itself, how it operates in the examples and counter examples cited. So without understanding the examples and counter examples, cited for the application of this परिभाषा, one cannot understand the function of परिभाषा in general. It may be another commentary in English which is already provided by SC Basu in his English translation and beyond the scope of this limited message.

  

I think you have understood that there are six types of सूत्र-s classified by their function, as explained by Abhyankar in one of his recent posts:

  

*संज्ञा च*परिभाषा च विधि: नियम एव च ।

अतिदेशो अधिकारश्च षड्विधम् सूत्र-लक्षणम् ॥

  

Here you can see more of this classification of the सूत्र-s:
