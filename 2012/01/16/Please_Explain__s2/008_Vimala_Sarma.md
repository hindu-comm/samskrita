Dear Urmila - Ji  
"Chaitanya"is from cetana (neuter) meaning consciousnes or intelligence, cet  
is from root cit meaning mind - it is made into abstract noun by the first  
vowel changing to vriddhi ie change from ce to cai and adding the suffix  
-ya - hence it is pertaining to consciousness or mind or intellect  
Krishna is adj either mf meaning black or of course the God Krishna.  
Vimala
