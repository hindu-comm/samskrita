Urmila,



Re "Chaitanya" and "Krishna", etc.



 Please take a look at this site
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> where you will find dictionaries of these words, along with standard ways of entering(typing) them.



They are more than just dictionaries though, you may also find explanations.



However, be warned that Samskrita, is by nature, quite technical when it comes to the explanations that you seek!





Best regards,



 Eddie
