Urmila,

==>

  
But I need to know which will be the best  
Reference and very comprehensive too giving explanations, word  
formations, vyakaran of the words etc.? (I live in USA).  

==>

You will need a Sanskrit grammar book as well as the lexicon. (There are  
also on-line tutorials).

On <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> you can view entire lexicons  
and Grammars as photo-copied images,  
so you will see exactly what they do for you.

The best lexicon is the Monier Monier-Williams, but it is not cheap, I paid  
ï¿½85 for mine a decade or two ago.  
Details can be obtained from Amazon, etc.

The grammars, are much cheaper, but I'll leave it to others to recommend  
them.  
But you will also need to be au fait with English grammar before you even  
begin!

Regards,

Eddie
