Thanks Mr. Hadley for the link you provided. May I ask all of you to  
recommend me a Dictionary/ Thesaurus for Sanskrit into English. I  
would need to web order it. But I need to know which will be the best  
Reference and very comprehensive too giving explanations, word  
formations, vyakaran of the words etc.? (I live in USA).
