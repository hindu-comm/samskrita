Urmila,  
  
Several Sanskrit grammars, written by Indian and European scholars, as  
also Sanskrit-English dictionaries are available for free download at  
[archive.org](http://archive.org). Enter search terms 'Sanskrit grammar' and Sanskrit  
English dictionary' in the search box.  
  
Among grammars, the one by R.G.Bhandarkar has taught Sanskrit grammar  
to generations of students in India. V.S.Apte's Dictionary is  
considered very authoritative, along with that of Monier-Williams. I  
could easily see Apte's in [archive.org](http://archive.org). MW's too is available online  
somewhere, but you may have to search for it.
